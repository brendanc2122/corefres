114,They are going to be ripe soon .

116,Oh .
117,Yes .
118,", with ears , ah ."
119,Where ?

121,Perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them .
122,", let them get some understanding ."
123,Mai Po Marshes adjacent to Wetland Park is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .
124,"Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here ."
125,"As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Wetland Park ."
126,These have become the best spots to observe birds .
127,"Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill ."
128,It is an endangered bird species throughout the world .
129,Uh-huh .
130,"Ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world ."
131,Wow .
132,"Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to Hong Kong to spend the winter ."
133,"Some of them , er , have stayed in Hong Kong Wetland Park ."
134,Uh-huh .
135,"So , our park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention ."
136,Uh-huh .
137,Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .
138,"They will complete the park 's entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign ."
139,"Ah , we have established the year 2006 as Discover Hong Kong Year ."
140,Why is that ?
141,"Because , as everyone knows , our Disneyland will open in September of this year ."
142,"In addition , we will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the Giant Buddha ."
143,"They add to what we already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous ."
144,"Moreover , er , we are including our software ."
145,Hong Kong 's software is very well known .
146,Like what 's used in our Symphony of Lights .
147,"We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year ."
148,"Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here ."
149,A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .
150,Because your line connects us with two --
151,"In recent years , Hong Kong 's tourist attractions have gradually moved from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and the New Territory ."
152,Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on Lantau Island of the New Territory .
153,"For this reason , Lantau Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot ."
154,The earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .
155,"In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas ."
156,"Therefore , Hong Kong 's Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of China , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in the east , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of China ."
157,"As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees ."
158,"However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe ."
159,"Since this giant bronze Buddha settled on Lantau Island , the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession ."
160,The important status of Lantau Island is increasingly apparent .
161,"No , it was totally inaccessible in the past ."
162,"In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting Hong Kong , Zhuhai , and Macao ."
163,In 1992 --
164,Could n't go in summer --
165,"So , after their return , Macao , and Hong Kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected ."
166,It 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
167,"One has to go up to Shenzhen , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to Zhuhai , then pass through Zhuhai to get to Macao ."
168,"For a Hong Kong person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient ."
169,"A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal ."
170,"With this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer ."
171,"However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off ."
172,This is what we have seen since 1999 .
173,"Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true ."
174,"Well , originally the construction of the new --"
175,"With this new Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , Hong Kong , Macao , and Zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go ."
176,"Macao is this way , and Zhuhai is this way ."
177,"From the perspective of either Hong Kong , Macao , or Zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone ."
178,"Er , %pw Zhuhai for sightseeing tours , Macao for entertainment , and we have Disneyland and , other attractions in Hong Kong ."
179,Each place has different attractions of its own .
180,"So , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home ."
181,"Once the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later ."
182,Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .
183,"However , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil ."
184,"Ah , currently it has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 ."
185,There 's also what we call soft opening .
186,"Ah , they are now rehearsing ."
187,"Ah , , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in September ."
188,"Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to Disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied ."
189,The Wonder Tour will start from Hong Kong .
190,This dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
191,It continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .
192,"Each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city ."
193,Hong Kong is a world famous shopping paradise .
194,What determined the position of Hong Kong as a shopping paradise ?
195,Is it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low prices ?
196,Is it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?
197,"After all , what are the joyful memories from inside paradise ?"
198,We respectfully invite you to watch Hong Kong : a Shopping Paradise in this edition of Across China .

221,Good evening everybody /.
222,Welcome to News Night /.
223,As uh Larry just told you I 'm Paula Zahn filling in for the two men Anderson Cooper and Aaron Brown /.
224,He lost his life long ago /.
225,but there 's still something modern science can give him back his identity /.
226,The mystery of the frozen airman continues /.
227,Next stop the lab /.
228,And anger in the hood over a sign of the times /.
229,If Fifty Cent does n't have good sense then he needs to stop doing what he 's doing /.
230,The rap star 's new movie is one thing /.
231,but the billboards for it are another /.
232,Residents of Los Angeles want them and their message moved /.
233,and the studio is caving /.
234,Also tonight the rise and fall and rise and fall and rise and fall of Martha Stewart /.
235,How many ups and downs can one woman have /?
236,This is News Night /.
237,First of all here 's a quick track of some of the stories we 're following tonight /.
238,President Bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to help protect Americans against the threat from bird flu /.
239,It includes stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million people /.
240,The president says there is no immediate threat but there is cause for concern /.
241,In Washington tensions are high after an unsual Senate session /.
242,Democrats used a little used rule to force a special closed session /.
243,Democrats say it was to force Republican leaders to complete a long promised investigation into how Bush administration officials handled pre-war intelligence on Iraq /.
244,Republicans for their part are calling it a political stunt /.
245,And Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says more American troops could soon be heading to Iraq /.
246,He says they will be needed temporarily to prevent an expected increase in insurgent attacks ahead of Iraq 's parliamentary election in December /.
247,But we begin tonight with an ongoing mystery /.
248,Who is that lone man discovered last month frozen in California 's Sierra Nevada mountains with just a few tantalizing clues to his identity /?
249,This we do know at this hour /.
250,The man died more than sixty years ago /.
251,He was in the military apparently a World War Two airman /.
252,And while it looks like his plane crashed in the mountains so did twenty - five other planes around the same time /.
253,Thelma Gutierrez went inside the forensic laboratory where scientists are trying to solve this mystery /.
254,An address book a plastic comb a vintage penny /.
255,You 're looking at the last things a young airman put into his pockets on the day he died clues to a World War Two cold case that you 're about to see for the very first time /.
256,It is a mystery that begins high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains at the bottom of a glacier /.
257,Two weeks ago climbers discovered a frozen man face down in the snow still in his army air force uniform and an unopened silk parachute /.
258,After six decades the airman is exhumed from his icy tomb and thawed out /.
259,but he 's wearing no military dog tags or ID /.
260,Did this World War Two pilot perish when his training flight crashed in the mountains like twenty - five other ill fated flights more than sixty years ago /?
261,The search for clues takes us to Honolulu Hawaii to the joint powmia accounting command or jpac /.
262,The mystery of the frozen airman is just one of more than a thousand different unsolved cases that scientists here at jpac are trying to solve /.
263,In this laboratory alone I 'm surrounded by the remains of at least twenty different service members who are in the process of being identified so that they too can go home /.
264,The investigation begins with a team of forensic specialists who probe and study the airman 's bones teeth and his belongings to piece together who he is /.
265,And almost immediately clues begin to surface /.
266,Dr. Robert Mann a forensic anthropologist has determined that the airman was Caucasian and had fair hair /.
267,Next though I 'm going to have to look at his clavicles /.
268,The airman 's collar bones and pelvic bones prove that he was in his twenties and died in an airplane crash /.
269,This is a person who likely died on impact versus perhaps freezing to death up in the mountains /.
270,I think that uh the injuries were so substantial um and severe that he would n't have felt anything /.
271,He would have died immediately /.
272,One two /-
273,Another important clue /.
274,He has a significant number of uh fillings /.
275,Like the bones xrays of his wisdom teeth also tell us something about his age /.
276,Root tips are closed /.
277,they 're sealed up which is more indicative of someone who would be at least twenty - one years old /.
278,And Dr. Andy Henry notices something else /.
279,The airmen have straight teeth /.
280,so he had a nice smile good teeth /.
281,Yes I would have to say that yes /.
282,Then there are the material clues the things he had on him when he died that offer a snapshot into who he could have been /.
283,If there 's a badge or anything else that /-
284,We know he was wearing a World War Two army air force uniform /.
285,Remnants of his sweater undergarments and socks are still intact /.
286,And more clues emerge from his tattered uniform a corroded nameplate this pin on his collar and this army aircorps insignia /.
287,When I found these insignia I was happy to see them /.
288,And our young white - haired airman also carried this black comb and some pocket change forty - five cents worth /.
289,Some of these dimes are in ranging from nineteen thirty - six to nineteen forty - two /.
290,In his uniform breast pocket Dr. Paul Emanovsky found this vintage Schafer pen and three small leatherbound address books /.
291,The pages have been decomposing /.
292,but could they contain names of friends and loved ones /?
293,And we 're going to put it in a spectral comparator /.
294,At first nothing /.
295,then like magic clues begin to emerge /.
296,Uh you can see all these letters from the calendar Sunday Monday Tuesday up at the top one nine four and two /.
297,Nineteen forty - two /.
298,Yeah /.
299,After hours of meticulous examination of each address book they yield no personal information clues that could have faded with time /.
300,And so while we still do not know who our twenty - something fair - haired airman is enormous progress has been made /.
301,Out of the thousands of unidentified World War Two service members Dr. Mann says they 've narrowed it down to just ten /.
302,So what was it like to grow up there /?
303,In Pleasant Grove we recently met these three sisters all in their eighties who have high hopes that the frozen airman proves to be their big brother Glen Munn whose plane went missing in the Sierra back in nineteen forty - two /.
304,Oh I just wanted you know to know that he was found and that we can have him brought home here for burial and /-
305,We do n't know that though /.
306,We do n't /.
307,but that 's my wishes /.
308,And until they learn otherwise they say they will keep that hope alive /.
309,And in the weeks and months ahead scientists are convinced they will identify this airman and return him home to his family wherever they might be /.
310,Thelma Gutierrez CNN Honolulu Hawaii /.
311,And there are some new developments to talk about tonight /.
312,Scientists may be even closer to solving the mystery /.
313,For an update we 're joined by Dr. Robert Mann one of the senior scientists you just saw working on this cold case /.
314,Thanks for spending time with us tonight doctor /.
315,We understand since Thelma left your laboratories you 've now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.
316,is that true /?
317,Well hi Paula /.
318,yes we have /.
319,Uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago our analysts and historians got to work on that /.
320,and they were able to wittle it down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.
321,and at this point they 've wittled it down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.
322,So we 've gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.
323,"So how much easier will that make it for you to unlock this case , do you think /?"
324,Well I think it 'll help quite a bit /.
325,"Um any time you 've got a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they 're in pretty good condition such as this one is , it 's mummified remains /."
326,We have some soft tissue we can deal with /.
327,so we can look at the color of the hair /.
328,we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.
329,but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.
330,and that 's where we 're going to now /.
331,So in the interest of full disclosure what I know about forensics is basically what I 've learned on CSI /.
332,and one would think that because you 've got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential DNA match with what you 've found in the ice /.
333,Is it not that simple /?
334,Well no no it 's not that simple /.
335,Um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what we 're looking at /.
336,And what we want to do is we do n't want to just look at the material evidence that we have and immediately um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.
337,What we want to do is have the evidence speak for itself /.
338,and when we look at this individual as we 've done the biological profile looking at his remains his bones his teeth and the material evidence /.
339,and what we 're able to tell from this individual is that he died in his twenties he stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um he sustained massive trauma to his body on impact /.
340,And he 's Caucasoid male /.
341,and so we know much more now just one week later than what we did when he came in about eight days ago /.
342,So the most important question is when do you think you 're going to know exactly who he is /?
343,Well that 's the most commonly asked question that we have /.
344,and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.
345,Nobody knows for sure exactly when we 'll identify him /.
346,What it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for successful identification /.
347,If I were to give my best opinion in this it would be a few weeks to a few months /.
348,Well we 'll be keeping our fingers crossed for you /.
349,Know how hard you all are working in the lab there Dr. Mann /.

379,We were all quite surprised /.
380,That 's good to hear /.
381,Thanks Erica /.
382,see you a little bit later on /.
383,And still to come on News Night tonight the saddest post-Katrina stories were those of the eldery who died in hospitals and nursing homes /.
384,Now there are thirteen investigations into why and how such tragedies happened /.
385,And supermodels are n't the only ones to whom weight matters /.
386,Jockies also may go too far to stay thin much too far /.
387,When at my worst I was heaving three or five to six seven times a day /.
388,Starving to stay thin that and more still to come on News Night /.
389,They happen to be the most vulnerable of hurricane victims the elderly many desperately ill living in nursing homes their fate in the hands of others /.
390,Dozens died /.
391,There are at least thirteen investigations now underway /.
392,And at some nursing homes the failure to evacuate cost lives /.
393,In other cases it was the evacuation itself that proved fatal /.
394,Here 's Keith Oppenheim /.
395,My mother was Thelma Wahl /.
396,She was ninety years old /.
397,She was a very good mother /.
398,She was at Huntingdon because she needed care /.
399,Priscilla Scott is mourning /.
400,Her ninety year old mother Thelma Wahl was a resident of the Huntingdon Place Nursing Home in Chalmette outside New Orleans /.
401,Priscilla says Thelma Wahl had serious osteoperosis fractures in her vertebrae but says Thelma was not on the verge of death /.
402,On Sunday August twenty - eighth the day before Hurricane Katrina struck the nursing home decided to evacuate patients /.
403,They waited too late to make the decision /.
404,Priscilla says her mother should have been transported by ambulance /.
405,Instead she says her mother sat on a school bus for twelve hours to Lafayette Louisiana normally a three hour trip /.
406,She says police told her there was no air conditioning /.
407,Police declined comment /.
408,The owner of the nursing home Thelma Wahl was being taken to tells us by the time the bus arrived Thelma Wahl was dead /.
409,I feel that uh the bus is what did it to her /.
410,She was alive when she left that nursing home /.
411,but she was not alive when she got to the Lafayette area /.
412,CNN made repeated attempts to contact administrators or representatives of Huntingdon Place /.
413,but either we could not make contact or our calls were not returned /.
414,But staff for the Louisiana Attorney General 's office did speak to us by phone and confirmed that the matter of just what happened to Thelma Wahl when she was transported from this facility is under investigation /.
415,After dozens of patients died in the wake of Hurricane Katrina nursing homes have been under scrutiny /.
416,Thirty - four patients were left behind at Saint Rita 's nursing home in New Orleans when Katrina hit /.
417,They all died in the flood /.
418,The owners were charged with negligent homicide /.
419,The county coroner says he urged Saint Rita 's to move its patients /.
420,They insisted several patients were too fragile to move /.
421,Before Hurricane Rita a busload of nursing home residents were being evacuated from Houston /.
422,but during the ride a fire from a back wheel accelerated because of oxygen canisters patients on board were using /.
423,Twenty - three people died /.
424,Federal officials are investigating /.
425,No charges have been filed /.
426,Joe Dodges executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association says when it comes to evacuations elder care facilities are damned if they do and damned if they do n't /.
427,Walk a mile in our shoes that 's all I have to say because anybody who works in a nursing home will very quickly learn that these are very fragile patients /.
428,We did the very best we could in these situations /.
429,We 've got /-
430,Dodges says the reality is old sick patients are always in jeopardy when a hurricane strikes a dilemma made worse by massive traffic jams during pre-storm evacuations /.
431,I mean if they 're on a bus for nine or twelve hours there 's a good chance someone 's going to die unfortunately /.
432,Certainly it 's a very very difficult question to answer should I evacuate /?
433,Jeff Meitrod and Steve Riddyah write for the Times Picayune New Orleans ' daily newspaper /.
434,They say nursing homes had to make tough calls /.
435,But last spring in a series of stories called State of Neglect they reported that Louisiana 's nursing homes are often poorly run and poorly regulated /.
436,Nursing homes that kill residents nursing homes that um seriously injure patients um because of bad care /.
437,uh and the state does n't really do very much about it /.
438,and so nursing home owners know that in a lot of cases it 's less expensive to break the rules and to hurt people than it is to provide the level of care that /-
439,Huntington Place was criticized in the articles and has had several law suits brought against it /.
440,but it had a good inspection record /.
441,Priscilla Scott says she is trying to contact the nursing home owners but has n't been able to find them /.
442,She feels even if they had to make a tough call they owe her a better explanation as to why her mother died /.
443,Keith Oppenheim CNN New Orleans /.
444,It still is n't clear why Huntington evacuated Thelma Wahl by bus rather than by ambulance /.
445,but officials have said there were not enough ambulances to take care of everyone in the region /.
446,Tomorrow night I will have a special report on a struggle that affects more than ten million Americans including one million men the struggle with eating disorders anorexia and bulimia /.
447,As I just said it 's not just women and girls who are affected /.
448,Men too struggle with these disorders /.
449,and I interviewed one of the nation 's top jockies Shane Sellers about the battle he waged everyday to control his weight /.
450,In the morning I 'd get up and take a diet pill um drink a cup of coffee um and then head out to the race track and /-
451,With no food in your stomach /.
452,No food in my stomach no /.
453,And um you know you go and see the trainers and work your horses in the morning that you have to work /.
454,Um by ten o'clock you 're finished uh /-
455,Were you hungry at this point /?
456,Oh I 'm starving you know /.
457,I mean I went to bed with nothing in my stomach either /.
458,Maybe you know just a piece of ham or s- /-
459,You know just grab something to put in my stomach before I went to bed and head to the track and maybe lay down for an hour and then uh head to the hotbox for a couple hours four or five pounds of water /.
460,The hotbox is a sauna a fixture in almost every jockey locker room /.
461,The hotbox sweatbox /.
462,Sellers would often spend two hours inside pooling or sweating off extra pounds /.
463,And are you miserable the whole time you 're in there /?
464,Oh it 's horrible /.
465,You have to be very weak /.
466,Weak /.
467,Ca n't have nothing /.
468,Yeah you 're already dehydrated you know /?
469,So for more than twenty years you went through this process of basically not eating anything during the day sitting in the sauna a couple hours a day sweating two or three pounds off getting back on your horses training and maybe maybe having a piece of ham /.
470,and that 's all you had to sustain you /.
471,"If I did eat anything sometime , when at my worst three or five to six seven times a day I was heaving /."
472,Jockies call it heaving or flipping /.
473,doctors would call it bulimia /.
474,Overcome by hunger pains Sellers would eat massive amounts of food and then throw it up to make weight /.
475,He says a tour of a jockey locker room shows you just how easy and accepted it was /.
476,These are regular toilets /.
477,and this is what they call a heaving /.
478,this is where they heave /.
479,You know it 's a much different type of commode /.
480,I do n't know if it was especially made for that purpose /.
481,but it 's sure not the same as the other /.
482,and that 's what we used it for /.
483,Is it true that some of you got so efficient at flipping that you could actually do it without putting your finger down your throat /.
484,I was one /.
485,Jockey Shane Sellers just one of the many people you 'll meet tomorrow night in Walking the Thin Line /.
486,It is a special edition of Paula Zahn Now that gets underway at eight pm eastern /.
487,Still to come on News Night tonight the Senate shuts down the doors clears the gallery /.
488,Was today 's rare closed session needed to gaurd national secrets /.
489,or was it a political forum /.
490,And the president wants billions to help fight a possible bird flu pandemic /.
491,Sounds like a lot of money /.
492,but will it actually be enough /?
493,Also tonight rap star Fifty Cent may be at the top of the charts /.
494,but one LA neighborhood is n't buying it /.
495,We ca n't say how those who will be voting on Samuel Alito 's nomination to Supreme Court feel about him /.
496,but we can say something about how you feel tonight /.
497,Here are the results of the CNN USA Today Gallup poll released just minutes ago of those asked about the president 's choice Judge Alito to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor /.
498,Seventeen percent said he 's an excellent choice /.
499,twenty - six percent called him a good choice /.
500,twenty - two percent rated him only fair /.
501,seventeen percent thought he was a poor choice /.
502,Questions about the facts or what were presented as facts that led the United States into the war in Iraq spilled into open warfare today on the Senate floor /.
503,Democrats forced the Senate into a rare closed door session /.
504,Republican leader Bill Frist said the Senate was hijacked /.
505,CNN 's Ed Henry was there /.
506,A Democratic sneak attack that sent shock waves through the Senate /.
507,Mr. President enough time has gone by /.
508,I demand on behalf of the American people that we understand why these investigations are n't being conducted /.
509,Democratic leader Harry Reed accused Republicans of failing to probe allegations the White House manipulated intelligence to justify the war in Iraq /.
510,And in accordance with rule twenty - one I now move that Senate go into closed session /.
511,President I second the motion /.
512,An easy but rare maneuver with extraordinary consequences /.
513,"The Senate chamber was locked down , television cameras shut off , so law makers could go into secret session to debate /."
514,Republican leader Bill Frist was enraged /.
515,Not with the previous Democratic leader or the current Democratic leader have ever I been slapped in the face with such an affront to the leadership of this grand institution /.
516,There has been at least consideration for the other side of the aisle before a stunt /.
517,and this is a pure stunt /.
518,Reed refused to back down demanding the Republican led intelligence committee finish a long awaited report on whether the Bush administration twisted intelligence /.
519,"This investigation has been stymied stopped , obstructions thrown up every step of the way /."
520,That 's the real slap in the face /.
521,that 's the slap in the face /.
522,And today the American people are going to see a little bit of light /.
523,What 's really going on is Democrats feel emboldened by the indictment of Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff believing this is their chance to issue a broader indictment of the Bush administration /.
524,We have lost over two thousand of our best and bravest /.
525,over fifteen thousand have been seriously wounded /.
526,We are spending more than six million dollars a month with no end in sight /.
527,and this Republican led Senate intelligence committee refuses to even ask the hard questions about the misinformation /-
528,Republicans insist they 're completing the investigation /.
529,and this is just a distraction /.
530,This is purely political /.
531,This is settling an old political score /.
532,Democrats say they also want to signal they 're ready to stand up to the Republican majority and may even filibuster the president 's latest Supreme Court pick Samuel Alito a move that would make these events seem like the opening fireworks in a much nastier battle /.
533,Ed Henry CNN Capitol Hill /.
534,So do you think we just saw the outlines to what the midterm election battlelines might look like /?
535,A debate that 's likely to rage on for many many months to come /.
536,Turning our attention now to something that has a lot of folks concerned /.
537,You 've been hearing an awful lot about avian or bird flu /.
538,The most common and deadly form has already spread in birds from South Asia to Europe /.
539,And now there is real concern that the virus could mutate and become devastating to humans /.
540,In fact some health experts say it 's just a matter of time /.
541,Today President Bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to prepare for a possible flu pandemic /.
542,Now much of that money would go toward stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million healthcare workers and other first responders speeding up production of vaccines and buying the anti-viral drugs Tamoflu and Rolenzo which in some cases prevent flu infection /.
543,And we now turn to senior medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupto who has just gotten back from South Asia where bird flu has in the past two years killed at least sixty - two people about half of those who were struck with it /.
544,Hundreds of millions of birds around the world have been destroyed to try to contain the disease /.
545,And Dr. Gupto now just joins us from the Emory University hospital in Atlanta /.
546,Always good to see you doctor /.
547,So /-
548,Thanks /.
549,I know you 've had a chance to study the plan the president put forth today /.
550,Does it go far enough in your estimation /?
551,You know what 's sort of interesting Paula /.
552,on one hand it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet /.
553,Pandemic flu does n't exist yet /.
554,But a lot of people are talking about it /.
555,and I think that 's remarkable to a lot of people eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.
556,On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.
557,"The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients /."
558,The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula /.
559,Uh let 's talk about the other problem of the plan where the president wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like Tamaflu and Rolenza /.
560,Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself /?
561,here 's the important thing about that /.
562,We do n't know for sure /.
563,A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on Tamaflu and Rolenza /.
564,These are antiviral drugs /.
565,they are not vaccines /.
566,They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact /.
567,But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.
568,The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.
569,and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.
570,So it 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work Paula /.
571,Dr. Sanjay Gupto thanks for the update /.
572,By the way are you catching a cold /?
573,A a little bit /.
574,You know I just got back /.
575,and the ninteen hour plane ride /.
576,Not bird flu though /.
577,I can assure you that Paula /.
578,Chicken soup /.
579,That 's right /.
580,Just what the doctor ordered /.
581,Works all the time /.
582,Yeah right /.
583,I made a free house call for you doctor /.
584,"Coming up on News Night Tonight , cooking a turkey is fine /."
585,appearing in one is n't /.
586,Will her Nielson do to Martha Stewart what her prison time did n't /?
587,Rapper Fifty Cents or Fitty Cent as some of you say sells millions of records /.
588,but one neighborhood does n't like the sales pitch /.
589,They call him Fitty Cent /.
590,but he is worth millions /.
591,His music like the gold single PIMP may come straight from violent inner city streets /.
592,but suburban kids from coast to coast love the heavy base beat /.
593,The music sells /.
594,but not everyone is buying the message /.
595,Savela Vargas reports /.
596,Fitty Cent 's film Get Rich or Die Trying has n't even hit theaters yet /.
597,but its marketing has already enraged people in South Central Los Angeles /.
598,Since two thousand there have been eight hundred homicides in this community /.
599,Now who wants to uphold that standard /?
600,Who wants to keep perpetrating that madness /?
601,The movie 's billboard shows the rapper in a crucifixion - like pose brandishing a microphone in one hand and a gun in the other /.
602,Paramount you are doing damage to our community /.
603,you are doing an injustice to our community /.
604,and you committing violence in our community /.
605,and that includes Fifty Cent too /.
606,It must go /.
607,And go it did /.
608,A day after about twenty five people rallied in Hyde Park Paramount pulled one sign down and since has pulled about half a dozen others near LA area schools /.
609,I think what happens oftentimes people are so overwhelmed in communities particularly African American communities by say an image in this case Hollywood /.
610,It just seems so big /.
611,it just seems so overwhelming /.
612,it 's almost like can we really fight City Hall /?
613,Whatever we 're going to do no matter how much outrage and anger that we express it 's not going to change anything /.
614,But in this case that was shown that that 's not the case /.
615,A Paramount spokesman says the company is reviewing billboards in other locations /.
616,Now similar complaints are coming from Brooklyn New York /.
617,Back in LA the image hits too close to home /.
618,Not too long ago we was over here /.
619,and a guy just pulled out a gun and was shooting right in front of my daughter /.
620,We did n't come back for a week cause I was scared and she was /.
621,So I mean that right there it enraged me /.
622,Not a good message /.
623,No it 's already enough gang violence out here /.
624,We do n't need that /.
625,Cynthia Levas director of Golden Day preschool thinks the billboard touched a nerve because many children here are Fitty Cent fans /.
626,When it comes to ABC they be like A B /.
627,and you have to wait for the other letters /.
628,but Fitty Cent song they can sing that word for word /.
629,Rapper Fitty Cent whose real name is Curtis Jackson says it was ludicrous to single out his poster /.
630,You got to look at how often we put out action films and other films that utilize weapons as a marketing tool /.
631,We 'll find guns or weapons on the cover of films probably more often than we 'll find people 's faces /.
632,He thinks the controversy will lead the film to greater box office success /.
633,but to the members of this community the victory is knowing that somebody listened /.
634,Man they heard us /.
635,They heard our voice /.
636,and I 'm glad /.
637,I mean I mean usually in this area nobody really cares /.
638,so for them to care about how we feel and how you know we raising our kids that meant a lot to all of us /.
639,so I 'm happy /.

724,but when you 're down there and you 're dealing with it it kind of just happens /.
725,You go into autopilot /.
726,and you look /.
727,and you think I ca n't help that person /.
728,let 's move on to the next one /.
729,Eight people including the bomber died at Allgate /.
730,one hundred and twenty were injured /.
731,At the end of the day back home with their loved ones a time for the firefighters to reflect and some mixed emotions /.
732,To them it was their happiness to see me walking through the door /.
733,"but I knew that somewhere someone 's daughter was n't coming home , their father was n't coming home /."
734,Watching it on the news is completely different to looking in the eyes of a wounded person /.
735,As a fire brigade you 're there to rescue them /.
736,so it 'll always be a sense of regret as we did as much as we could but there was still a human cost and there 's nothing that we 'll ever be able to do about it /.
737,Andrew Carey CNN London /.
738,A producer from our London Bureau /.
739,Still to come the ups and downs of Martha Stewart and the British are coming ! The British are coming !
740,No wait /.
741,are n't they already here /?
742,But does anyone really care /?
743,And now we 're going to take a look at the trials and tribulations of Martha Stewart /.
744,You might have thought serving time in prison was tough /.
745,"As it turns out , being on the outside might be even tougher /."
746,It seems like just yesterday Martha Stewart was sprung from prison and poised for her comeback /.
747,"This is a country where we believe in second acts , we believe in redemption , we believe in confessional stories , we believe in the comeback , we 've /-"
748,Five months behind bars had n't dimmed Martha 's image /.
749,If anything it was soaring /.
750,Along with her company stock it doubled during that time /.
751,Martha once again took the helm of her company and her magazine /.
752,She also landed a starring role in the spinoff of one of TV 's hottest reality shows The Apprentice /.
753,Martha the woman everyone loves to hate was loved /.
754,It 's really wonderful to be back /.
755,I 've missed you as you can imagine /.
756,But what a difference a TV show makes especialy when that show is a flop /.
757,I 'm looking for the apprentice /.
758,The Apprentice Martha Stewart debuted in September /.
759,Her ratings tanked /.
760,and her stock followed suit plunging about forty - seven percent since her release from prison in March /.
761,Once again Martha Stewart is persona non grata /.
762,Even her friend and fellow Apprentice star Donald Trump made it clear that her show was not a good thing /.
763,He had this to say in a recent radio interview /.
764,I think there was confusion between Martha 's Apprentice and mine /.
765,and mine continues to do well /.
766,and the other has struggled very severely /.
767,I think it probably hurt mine /.
768,and I sort of predicted that it would /.
769,You 're fired /.
770,Ouch smackdown from the Donald /.
771,Donald /?
772,Martha Stewart punched back in a recent Fortune magazine interview saying she was actually told that she would be firing the Donald /.
773,Is the old Martha back again /?
774,She has a track record of being associated unfortunately with the B word and not a little B but a capital B /.
775,Can the comeback queen come back again /?
776,I think she can be saved /.
777,Anybody can be saved /.
778,Any organization can be saved /.
779,but it takes a lot of hard work /.
780,Is n't that one of the reasons for our infatuation with Martha /?
781,She 's the perennial story of celebrity redemption /.
782,She said this to Fortune magazine I have learned that I really can not be destroyed /.
783,Apparently Martha Stewart is betting on her own comeback as well /.
784,We 'll see /.
785,Still to come on News Night the prince and his brand new wife making their first trip to the US since their marriage /.
786,This time it 's not exactly a fairy tale /.
787,This week Americans are getting a rare chance to treat royalty well like royalty /.
788,Prince Charles and his new wife Camilla have jumped across the pond and are touring the United States making their first stop today in New York /.
789,It 's Charles ' first opportunity to showcase his new wife /.
790,but few Americans seem to care /.
791,Here 's Jeanie Mowth /.
792,What a difference two decades make /.
793,Charles and Diana visited a JC Penney 's on the prince 's last official US tour /.
794,Twenty years later here 's the prince with his new wife attending a party at the Museum of Modern Art along with Yoko Ono Diane Sawyer Henry Kissinger Donald Trump Joan Collins and even Sting /.
795,But it still stings some Diana fans to see those old shots of glamorous Princess Di dancing with John Travolta at the White House /.
796,But when it comes to Camilla gossip columnists can get pretty catty /.
797,We 're all welcoming the prince and the duchess or mistress of whatever she is this week /.
798,A lone protestor parked herself outside the UN where Charles would later visit /.
799,Camilla you are no princess said her sign with a horse on it /.
800,The horse is basically Camilla /.
801,We all know that she 's a horse /.
802,She does n't belong here /.
803,and she 'll never be able to take Diana 's place ever /.
804,But at least the horse is pretty /.
805,The royals flew in amid headlines declaring their visit a royal bore /.
806,Only ninteen per cent of Americans polled said they were interested in the visit /.
807,eighty - one per cent said they were not /.
808,Prince Charles and Camilla are in town /.
809,Do you care /?
810,Not a wit /.
811,Royal watching is not for you /?
812,I have n't watched it yet /.
813,I loved Princess Diana /.
814,I do n't care for this new chick in town /.
815,Sorry /.
816,The new chick and her prince started the day with a visit to Ground Zero /.
817,They then unveiled a memorial to British victims of Nine Eleven /.
818,Everywhere they went there were curtsies and /-
819,Hi everyone /.
820,first up on the docket tonight we got an interview with the witness who led investigators to a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway /.
821,He 's telling NBC news what and who he saw just days after Natalee 's May thirtieth disappearance /.
822,Also Natalee 's mother met with the lead prosecutor in the investigation today /.
823,And while the landfill continues to be searched and lead suspect Joran Van Der Sloot is interrogated for the fourth straight day by a team of behavioral specialists NBC 's Michelle Kosinski remains in Aruba /.
824,"So Michelle the authorities really believe that uh this witness with regard to the landfill 's credible , do n't they /?"
825,Well the authorities including the FBI we found out had checked this witness out early on just days after Natalee disappeared /.
826,And we just found out about this witness a couple weeks ago /.
827,That 's when his existence became widely known through private investigators and other sources /.
828,And it has been reported that he was afraid to come forward /.
829,Well it turns out he was just afraid for his identity to be known /.
830,but we learned that he came forward very quickly after he says he saw what happened in the landfill that day just days after it happened /.
831,He talked to police /.
832,He talked to the FBI /.
833,The FBI actually went out to that landfill with dogs looked around that area even before it became piled up with garbage /.
834,and they did n't find anything /.
835,It 's the EquuSearch volunteers who really said hey we believe this guy /.
836,His story does n't change /.
837,He seems to pan out /.
838,He seems to be a lucid guy /.
839,He seems to also be insistent that he saw something /.
840,So he says he saw some men drive up in a white pickup truck men that he says he later recognized to be the three suspects in this case /.
841,He says they took what looked like a body out of the back of the pickup truck /.
842,It was wrapped up in a bag /.
843,But when the wind blew he says he saw the upper part of a woman 's body blonde hair /.
844,and then he says they buried this body there in the landfill /.
845,Well over a period of weeks some ten feet of garbage has piled up /.
846,EquuSearch will tell you too that when they bring out dogs it 's very difficult for a dog to catch a scent in that landfill when they 're coming across things like medical waste /.
847,but they 're determined to keep going /.
848,He saw uh the woman 's body and inside a bag /.
849,Her hair was blowing out with the wind /.
850,And uh he did n't say this now /.
851,but he told that the back kind of came off and he saw half of the woman 's body /.
852,One of the most compelling reasons searchers say they believe this guy very much is that they say he gave them some clues as to things they would find buried deep within that garbage around that same area where he claims he saw a body things like a plastic pool /.
853,He said that there was a dirt road buried under all that garbage /.
854,Well they found those things and a couple of other items that he said would be there /.
855,The problem is they just have n't found any sign at all of Natalee Holloway /.
856,but they want to clear that place out and just feel satisfied that they looked as best they could because it 's disturbing /.
857,I mean his story has panned out in some ways /.
858,so they do n't want to give this up /.
859,Well that 's the question I have for you Michelle /.
860,"So are you saying that the authorities uh looked into this guy 's story early on and they kind of pooh - poohed it and then EquuSearch came in a couple weeks later and said wait a sec , wait a sec , let 's give this guy a shot here and they followed up on it /?"
861,Yeah pretty much /.
862,Uh the witness told us directly that in the beginning he felt like nobody was believing his story /.
863,But we talked to a high level source in law enforcement /.
864,and it turns out they did check it out /.
865,Hm /.
866,They sent the FBI out there with a dog /.
867,But EquuSearch says hey maybe we can do something more thoroughly here /.
868,We can bring out teams of dogs /.
869,But here 's the thing /.
870,They still have n't found one sign of her /.
871,but uh they are determined to keep it up through the weekend at least /.
872,Alright Michelle Kosinski as always thanks a lot /.
873,And as Michelle reported Natalee 's mother Beth Holloway Twitty met with the lead prosecutor in the investigation this afternoon Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl came forward said she had an encounter with Joran Van Der Sloot the chief suspect /.
874,And on our program last night Beth told me the story /.
875,A beautiful eighteen year old blonde - headed girl from New Jersey um you know was able to recount an encounter that she had with Joran Van Der Sloot Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe during the month of April oh five /.
876,And what did she say happened /?
877,you know it 's a pretty long scenario /.
878,We have a lot of details /.
879,Um you know the main thing to to sum it up as you know Joran how he entered this establishment /.
880,I believe that you know if you enter on the right side you have to have a valid ID /.
881,You enter Carlos N' Charlie 's on the left side you must have some type of I do n't know if it 's a VIP pass or what to enter /.
882,but Joran enters the establishment on the left side +approaches these group of tourist /.
883,Um you know it 's interesting how he is able to um try to work his way in and connect establish himself in uh Carlos N' Charlie 's /.
884,Was walking her around and these other tourists and was able to point out Satish and Deepak Kalpoe /.
885,They 're sitting ironically in the same corner the same stools that they were seated at in the picture that 's been all over international media /.
886,So that must be their spot where they wait while Joran is working /.
887,And um you know it was so interesting how everyone in the casino knew Joran /.
888,you know he knew everyone was greeting all the guys with this grip handshake /.
889,All the girls approach him with a kiss on the cheek /.
890,It was interesting how um you know he was able to order these group of girls by just merely leaning over the bar and ordering three shots of one fifty - one one for himself and three for the tourists with no money /.
891,So he 's got an open uh tab at Carlos N' Charlie 's /.
892,able to run a tab /.
893,And you know then you notice that in a evening 's proceeding he 's even approaching these girls getting close to closing time /.
894,Did /.
895,So that 's another unique pattern that he has /.
896,did she say uh anything about uh violence /?
897,No she did n't say anything about violence /.
898,but what I was looking for was a history is a predatory type behavior which I think Joran and Deepak and Satish have and how tightly connected the three are /.
899,Now i- /.
900,Joining me now is the private investigator who has been uh working with Natalee 's family TJ Ward and his associate Harold Phipps /.
901,Gentlemen thanks very much uh for coming on the program /.
902,+Appreciate it /.
903,Thank you /.
904,TJ let me start with you on this issue of this woman uh who came up uh to Beth /.
905,Have you been able to follow up on that /.
906,and how relevant do you think it is /?
907,Uh we have n't followed up with it /.
908,Um Beth and I have talked about it /.
909,and we will be following up on it uh here shortly /.
910,is it relevant /?
911,I mean a lot of my viewers wrote in saying alright so what /.
912,this guy 's a pickup artist /.
913,how does that really impact the case /?
914,Well it just shows it 's a pattern of um what his activity is when he hangs out at Carlos N' Charlie 's /.
915,I mean and trying to pick women up and take them from the bar and whatever he 's doing with them after that /.
916,But if there 's no violence associated with that does that help you in the investigation /?
917,Well again we do n't think there was a violent issue with him with Natalee /.
918,We think probably +something has happened to Natalee /.
919,and they panicked and then went forth and did what they were supposed to do /.
920,I mean there 's issues that 's come up /.
921,Um um well we feel something happened when Natalee was with them /.
922,What do you mean by that /?
923,Either she either passed out regurgitated /.
924,um something had happened /.
925,And on top of that now there 's a statement that 's come up from Joran Van Der Sloot that he 's given to the police uh one of twenty - two statements he 's given by the way that um Deepak had uh raped her and killed her on the beach /.
926,So at this point what the police have you know again we 're unaware because we 're not getting any information from law enforcement /.
927,so we have to go on the course of information that we 're gathering on behalf of the family /.
928,Well let me ask Harold how do you all know that /?
929,I mean that information for example about that particular statement that TJ was just mentioning /.
930,How do we know that /?
931,Yeah how do you know that that statement was actually made by Joran Van Der Sloot /?
932,Oh we do n't /.
933,This is the statements that were being attributed to us on those /.
934,Uh since we have n't interviewed Joran we do n't know exactly what he has said /.
935,but some of that statement has been let out /.
936,and uh through a chain of different individuals uh uh they have told us uh what the statement was /.
937,TJ just so I 'm clear where are you getting that from that that statement was made by Joran about Deepak /?
938,I have seen a copy of the statement from one of the local newspapers here um Diario /.
939,Um Jossy Mansur produced and showed me a copy of that statement that uh Joran Van Der Sloot made um the last time that I was here in Aruba /.
940,and uh he conveyed it from Dutch into English and uh showed me the statement /.
941,Uh TJ are you in any trouble there /?
942,I mean there 's been a lot of discussions about the authorities getting uh annoyed about you knocking on doors and things like that /.
943,Well it 's not that /.
944,Um there was some /.
945,the Aruban authorities /-
946,and we 've had conversations about this /.
947,This is squared away /.
948,It 's been straightened out /.
949,Um there was uh some evidence that leaked out to the fact that had an arrest warrant for my arrest on Wednesday and that I was working without a work permit and I was going to be deported by law enforcement and Wednesday night the law enforcement was looking for me to arrest me /.
950,Uh all that is untrue /.
951,and I want to make that perfectly clear /.
952,Uh this was brought up by another media station here on the island that uh made claim to that /.
953,but I can to assure /.
954,Alright /.
955,It 's not true /.
956,We 'll move on /.
957,Alright /.
958,Yes /.
959,Alright /.
960,Um uh Harold finally this landfill /.
961,Uh are you hopeful uh that EquuSearch is going to find something /?
962,How credible do you think that witness is who says that he saw three men dumping what looked like a blonde body /?
963,Well uh as a retired FBI agent I 'm always hopeful for an outcome /.
964,Uh we interviewed the individual at length /.
965,and having experienced hundreds if not thousands of interviews during my thirty - one years uh this guy was very uh online /.
966,He did n't go mm ah /.
967,I mean he was like telling a story /.
968,and it did n't appear to me at all like he was coached or practiced /.
969,Mhm /.
970,He just told a story uh from the beginning to the end /.
971,and I believe him /.
972,I think there was something there /.
973,"if there is the body , whether it 's still there is another story /."
974,Mhm /.
975,There has been uh a period of time since then /.
976,and it could have been removed again /.
977,But uh his story I think is credible /.
978,We also had a /-
979,TJ /.
980,Sorry go ahead /.
981,finish up Harold /.
982,No go ahead /.
983,I was just going to a- /-
984,I 'm out of time /.
985,I was going to ask TJ bottom line do you think that you 're going to be able to crack the case in the next uh couple weeks /?
986,Well it depends /.
987,I believe that law enforcement uh since the FBI 's been here has been working very credibly /.
988,Mhm /.
989,And uh I believe that they have something um that 's probably solid enough and hopeful uh come September fourth that Joran Van Sloot will stay where he 's positioned right now /.
990,Mhm /.
991,and that there 'll be additional arrests in this matter from uh parties and individuals that waited we already know that are possibly involved in this disappearance /.
992,Alright /.
993,TJ Ward and Harold Phipps thanks a lot guys for taking the time /.
994,Really appreciate it /.
995,Coming up two former jurors in the Michael Jackson case writing tell - all books about the case /.
996,They now apparently say Jackson is guilty /.
997,and they 're apparently saying that they broke all kinds of rules in the jury room sneaking in tapes of news reports /.
998,An insider on the new books joins me next /.
999,And it 's been a month since this man went missing on a honeymoon on a Mediterranean cruise /.
1000,Police now looking into three men who might 've had something to do with his disappearance /.
1001,maybe foul play /.
1002,And our weeklong series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose wraps up tonight /.
1003,We 're trying to get these guys before they strike again /.
1004,We 'll check in with Erin Runnion five year old daughter Samantha raped and killed by a sex offender /.
1005,Your email abrams report at MSNBC dot com /.
1006,Please include your name where you 're writing from /.
1007,I respond at the end of the show /.
1008,"New York Daily News today reports that jurors are saying there were all sorts of shannanigans going on in the jury room at the Michael Jackson case , that a juror wanted to convict Jackson smuggled in a medical dictionary to prove Jackson fits the definition of a pedophile /."
1009,She was later she says intimidated into changing her vote to not guilty /.
1010,Same juror we told you about yesterday Eleanor Cook who 's reportedly writing a tell - all book titled Guilty as Sin Free as a Bird /.
1011,News also reports another allegation that quote another juror sneaked a forbidden video of Court TV broadcast featuring the prosecution friendly Dianne Dimond and Nancy Grace to the jury room but a faulty VCR prevented a sneak peak /.
1012,And then a quote gang of three female jurors were such rabid Jackson fans that they cooed not my Michael when the panel discussed the felony charges against the pop idol /.
1013,Yikes /.
1014,Stacy Brown MSNBC analyst author of Michael Jackson the Man Behind the Mask and a name who keeps popping up with all these books /.
1015,Stacy are you writing any of these books first of all /?
1016,No I 'm not /.
1017,Alright /.
1018,But you actually talked to these jurors about writing a book /.
1019,That 's correct /.
1020,Alright /.
1021,and you were approached alright /.
1022,I was approached /.
1023,"And so they are saying the things that the Daily News reports , are they not /?"
1024,Well they are saying a lot more than just that /.
1025,What else they saying /?
1026,Um well eh let 's just clear up with the medical book /.
1027,She did n't actually bring it into the deliberation room /.
1028,the jurors were meeting /.
1029,They rendezvoused at a juvenile hall in Santa Maria /.
1030,and she bought it there /.
1031,and as they were getting into the van they ordered it to put it back in her car /.
1032,but she wanted them to understand Ellie Cook this is that this fits Michael to a tee /.
1033,"So she wanted them to know Michael Jackson 's guilty , he 's a pedophile /."
1034,and then what /?
1035,Then she just caved /?
1036,She says she was pressured /.
1037,Think she was threated /.
1038,and they were threatening to throw her off the jury /.
1039,Come on /.
1040,"this is the one who 's been wanting to write a book since the beginning , right /?"
1041,Yeah absolutely /.
1042,Her granddaughter had put out feelers since she was picked for the jury /.
1043,"What other kind of shannigans were going on back there , do they say /?"
1044,Well um they mentioned um as you had mentioned in your open about the Court TV video /.
1045,Someone had apparently taped some Court TV um stuff /.
1046,and they tried to play it /.
1047,Uh apparently it was a malfunction in the video tape /.
1048,Mhm /.
1049,Well let me give the juror 's explanation for this /.
1050,And /.
1051,This is Paula Coccoz /.
1052,we talked to her today juror number ten /.
1053,It 's number four /.
1054,Uh the bailiff brought in a TV with a VCR so we could review the sheriff 's interview /.
1055,and we went to put in the tape /.
1056,The tape was marked Court TV /.
1057,The people at the courthouse had left this tape in the VCR /.
1058,We told the bailiff about this /.
1059,and he seemed concerned about whether or not we reviewed the tape /.
1060,We told them we did n't watch it /.
1061,We did n't find out until later what was on the tape /.
1062,Yeah /.
1063,according to Ellie though someone taped that show /.
1064,It was n't left there /.
1065,Um and there was a problem /.
1066,Now I know that someone else mentioned that there was a problem as well with a VCR /.
1067,but if you remember well the interview with the sheriff and the young boy was on a disk and not a VCR /.
1068,And this is number five /.
1069,Uh this is again the Daily News /.
1070,That Cook uh admits that she frequently winked at Jackson 's mother um Katherine in court and exchanged wardrobe tips with the entertainer 's mom which resulted in them wearing the same colors on certain days /.
1071,Ellie Cook talked about that yeah /.
1072,She mentioned that they would wink and nod at each other /.
1073,I do n't understand /.
1074,So on the one hand this juror 's saying I was convinced he was guilty you know /.
1075,and they 're saying oh she was trying to bring in a medical text /.
1076,and on the other hand she 's sitting there winking at Katherine Jackson talking to her about what clothes they 're going to wear /.
1077,Saying everything was going to be okay /.
1078,She /-
1079,And that 's why you did n't believe this story /.
1080,That 's why I do n't yeah ah /.
1081,That 's why you would n't write the book /.
1082,I 'm not writing it because I just think that there 's a lot of issues with this /.
1083,"if you felt that this guy was guilty , you felt he was a pedophile , he lives in your community , he 's a very powerful member of your community why let him free then /?"
1084,Do you just not believe these jurors /?
1085,Is that the problem /?
1086,I just do n't believe them /.
1087,Why /?
1088,I mean they 're making this up for money /?
1089,It 's just /-
1090,well uh you know I think in both their cases they feel now in retrospect maybe we made a mistake /.
1091,And see I can live with that if that 's what they are saying /.
1092,but they 're not saying that /.
1093,They 're saying that they believed all along he was guilty /.
1094,and I 'm having a hard time with that /.
1095,Alright Stacy uh stick around for a minute /.
1096,Joining me now NBC News legal analyst former prosecutor Susan Filan and attorney and Celebrity Justice executive producer Harvey Levin criminal defense attorney Daniel Horowitz /.
1097,Harv what do you make of /-
1098,Look you 've followed this close /.
1099,What do you make of all this /?
1100,Well I think Eleanor Cook is a wacko Dan /.
1101,and I think if any of these allegations are true these jurors need to be prosecuted /.
1102,I mean this is jury tampering from within the jury if these allegations are true /.
1103,And if there is ever to be a fair celebrity trial again especially in California somebody needs to say look we are drawing the line /.
1104,You 're not going to get books at the end of the rainbow and do things inappropriate /.
1105,If it pans out it 's true I think Tom Sneddon himself should prosecute without respect to whether it would have been pro or anti Michael Jackson /.
1106,So Susan let 's assume for a minute it 's true /.
1107,Again you 're the prosecutor /.
1108,and you 're sitting there going are you kidding me /?
1109,There were two or three jurors who wanted to convict /.
1110,and they caved because they were pressured or whatever /.
1111,"You ca n't do anything , can you /?"
1112,Nothing /.
1113,eh game over /.
1114,You ca n't take an appeal from an aquittal /.
1115,The problem that I have with this is as members of the media we had an awfully difficult time with access to this trial /.
1116,If this is going to set a precedent to shut media out because these highly publicized celebrity trials yield these faulty verdicts she 's doing far far more harm than she could ever understand /.
1117,Yeah but let 's forget about the media stuff /.
1118,"I mean the bottom line is the prosecutors ca n't do anything about this , right /?"
1119,"I mean if the jurors were tampering with evidence , if they were playing with evidence et cetera back there the prosecutors have to just suck it up and be depressed /."
1120,There 's no remedy /.
1121,They have to eat it /.
1122,It 's over /.
1123,Daniel I mean Stacy does n't really believe them /.
1124,but what do you think /?
1125,Well Dan I believe them /.
1126,You know jurors are people /.
1127,We expect them to be perfect little robots doing what the judge says /.
1128,and they do n't /.
1129,They 're going to watch television /.
1130,I 'm sure they all watch your show /.
1131,and they watched Susan try to convict Michael Jackson /.
1132,but then I hope they listened to me and to reason /.
1133,But the bottom line is they reached a fair and just verdict /.
1134,You have to trust people and nail those attempts to control and hypercontrol this case /.
1135,Just backfired /.
1136,It made the jurors feel isolated /.
1137,and now they 're all quiet /.
1138,They wo n't talk to us about what really went on /.
1139,Okay here 's my problem /.
1140,It 's this woman saying she was forced and bullied right into reaching the verdict that she did /.
1141,and there she is saying I did n't like the way that this woman snapped at me talking about the accuser 's mother et cetera /. /.
1142,You know Dan I do n't even talk to juries afterwards unless I win because you 're always going to hear things like that /.
1143,People in a jury room are in a bar room brawl /.
1144,It 's not supposed to be pretty /.
1145,and when it 's over there 's always second thoughts and regrets /.
1146,but it 's the system /.
1147,and it works /.
1148,Harvey you know what /.
1149,eh hey hey if I may say /-
1150,But Dan your point is that /-
1151,You know a bar room brawl is one thing /.
1152,They were acting like outlaws if these allegations are true /.
1153,Right /.
1154,And you know I agree Susan that the prosecutors ca n't do anything to Michael Jackson /.
1155,but they certainly can do something to the jurors /.
1156,and I think it is more important right now to say /-
1157,I 'm telling you Dan you and I have covered a lot of trials in this city /.
1158,and we 've seen a lot of weird things happen since OJ Simpson with books and everything else /.
1159,If jurors realize that there 's a back end if you will which is a Hollywood term to these trials and if they get caught so what they get caught but they can still publish a book if they believe that everything is going to change in this city /.
1160,let me ask you /.
1161,Harv here 's the thing that I do n't understand /.
1162,And this is why Stacy made the right call on this /.
1163,Alright Stacy may say he did n't believe them whatever /.
1164,I do n't think that many people are going to buy this book /.
1165,Is that Stacy /?
1166,I did n't either /.
1167,Is that the real reason you did n't want to write the book Stacy /?
1168,Well no no that 's not the b- /-
1169,You did n't think you were going to make any money /?
1170,Come on /.
1171,"That 's the real reason , is n't it /?"
1172,No /.
1173,the real reason is Dan believe it or not I have a conscience /.
1174,I wrote Man Behind the Mask with Bob Jones because I believed in Bob Jones /.
1175,and I still believe in the material /.
1176,I do n't believe in this material /.
1177,uh Harvey do you agree with me that the book 's not really going to sell much /?
1178,Absolutely /.
1179,For two reasons /.
1180,Number one I think it would have been a better book if he would have been found guilty /.
1181,And secondly I think the credibility of the authors um mean a whole lot /.
1182,and eh you know I just think everything is so off - kilter people are n't going to be particularly interested in it /.
1183,Yes /.
1184,Yeah /.
1185,Uh reminder /.
1186,you can hear from uh those two jurors who now say Jackson 's guilty premiere of Rita Cosby Live and Direct Monday night at nine PM eastern right here on MSNBC /. /.
1187,Susan Filan 's going to stick around /.
1188,Harv Daniel Horowitz thanks a lot /.
1189,appreciate it /.
1190,Coming up no clear explanation for what happened to a honeymooner who disappeared from a Mediterranean cruise last month /.
1191,Police now focusing on three men seem to be telling some inconsistent stories /.
1192,And our series on wanted sex offenders around the country concludes tonight /.
1193,It 's called Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.
1194,College student Dru Sjodin allegedly raped and murdered by a sex offender two years ago /.
1195,Her mother joins us along with Erin Runnion whose five year old girl was raped and murdered by a convicted sex offender /.
1196,"Coming up , man disappears on his honeymoon cruise ship /."
1197,Police on the case focusing now on three men seem to be telling some inconsistent stories /.
1198,More on the investigation coming up /.
1199,but first the headlines /.
1200,Hello I 'm Milissa Rehberger /.
1201,Here 's what 's happening /.
1202,The Russian military is racing to rescue seven sailors trapped in a minisubmarine six hundred and twenty - five feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean /.
1203,The sub got snagged in a giant fishing net /.
1204,A US Airforce jet carrying robotic undersea vehicles is on its way from California to aid in that rescue /.
1205,It 's expected to arrive in ten to twelve hours /.
1206,It is unclear how much oxygen remains onboard that minisub /.
1207,The Russian Navy 's chief spokesperson says there may only be about twelve hours worth while another official says there 's more than twenty - four hours left /.
1208,British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the crackdown on terrorists and extremists in the wake of the London bombing /.
1209,He proposed new deportation measures against people who advocate violence /.
1210,And a new anti-insurgents operation underway in western Iraq /.
1211,US marines and Iraqi troops launched Operation Quick Strike in the Euphrates River Valley /.
1212,That is northwest of Baghdad /.
1213,That 's where twenty - two marines were killed this week /.
1214,Back to the Abrams Report /.
1215,Exactly a month after twenty - six year old George Smith vanished from a Royal Caribbean ship cruising in the Mediterranean NBC News has learned federal investigators are now focusing on three men who were traveling on the cruise ship called Brilliance of the Seas two Russian brothers who live in Brooklyn and one man who lives in California /.
1216,The attorney for the California man issued this statement /.
1217,We 've been cooperating with the FBI and the US Attorney 's Office in their investigation /.
1218,and we 'll continue to do so /.
1219,However we 've been asked by the authorities not to speak with the media while the investigation is pending /.
1220,and we intend to honor that request /.
1221,This photo taken the day shows what appears to be blood on the awning below the cabin where Smith and his wife were staying /.
1222,Smith was traveling on his honeymoon and had left Barcelona Spain on June twenty - ninth /.
1223,what was meant to be a twelve day cruise /.
1224,Halfway through the trip on the morning of July fifth he disappeared /.
1225,He was reported missing later that day when the ship docked in Kusadasi Turkey /.
1226,NBC has also learned that Smith 's new wife Jennifer Hagel has been questioned is not a suspect /.
1227,Two were married on June twenty - fifth in Newport Rhode Island /.
1228,Joining me now former Connecticut prosecutor NBC News uh legal analyst Susan Filan who 's been covering the case closely and Orlando police chief Walter uh Zalisko who was on the same cruise that Smith travelled on as well as forensic expert Larry Kobilinsky /.
1229,Alright so Susan what do you know about the investigation /?
1230,Well NBC news has learned from a law enforcement source that the wife is not a suspect and that they are focusing in on these two Russian brothers as you said who live in Brooklyn /.
1231,The California teen is apparently the key to the case at this point /.
1232,That 's law enforcement 's focus /.
1233,If this young man will talk this could break open what happened to George /.
1234,The key question is is this a tragic accident or is this foul play /?
1235,Right now law enforcement seems to think it 's foul play /.
1236,US attorney Kevin O'Connor said we have reason to believe there could have been foul play here /.
1237,Um alright uh Mister Zalisko do you know anything from your personal experience of having been on the cruise as to what happened /?
1238,Uh good evening sir /.
1239,Uh first I 'd just like to clarify I 'm a police chief in Oak Hill Florida not Orlando /.
1240,Uh now as far as the cruise uh I was on the cruise that uh uh day /.
1241,and the way I became aware of what occured was that uh the morning of the fifth a relative of mine had mentioned that there was blood stain on the canopy beneath her uh balcony /.
1242,at that point we kind of dismissed it /.
1243,We did n't know what was uh going on /.
1244,Uh we then went on our daily excursion /.
1245,However later on into the cruise that day uh the ship 's captain went onto the PA system and made an announcement that uh authorities were on the ship and they were investigating the possibility that an individual had gone overboard during the night or early morning hours /.
1246,When I asked my cousin the uh size of the blood splatter she had indicated it was relatively the size of a small uh dog of a beagle type /.
1247,However viewing those photographs on TV that blood splatter is much larger than uh a small dog /.
1248,Mhm /.
1249,In fact it 's maybe three to four feet in length /.
1250,And then we 've been hearing many stories that uh there were a lot of people going into and out of the state rooms uh which would indicate that the crime scene was not properly secured in the early stages of the investigation /.
1251,Well /.
1252,Alright let me play this piece of sound from one of the passengers who was uh staying right nearby uh this particular uh room /.
1253,We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin /.
1254,Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing /.
1255,And he says uh later um chief that he heard a horrific thud /.
1256,Well yeah that would indicate that something did go on there /.
1257,and we know uh that the three individuals were in a room uh with Mister Smith /.
1258,And the question that has to be uh presented to everybody is why is it taking so long for authorities to interview the individual that was in a cabin next door /?
1259,Mhm /.
1260,Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after the crime /.
1261,Yeah /.
1262,Yeah /.
1263,And you would not just interview that individual next door /.
1264,You would have to take a step to interview people above below and to both sides /.
1265,Susan what 's the answer to that /?
1266,But Dan /.
1267,there are jurisdictional problems here /.
1268,You know it 's not a clear cut case as to who gets to prosecute this case /.
1269,Turkey ca n't do anything without a body /.
1270,United States can /.
1271,Fair play of the United States for stepping in /.
1272,fair play to law enforcement for getting involved /.
1273,Jurisdiction is n't clear /.
1274,but they 're working very hard to solve the crime /.
1275,I do n't think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in this case /.
1276,Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got their investigators and their lawyers in from what I understand right away to make this go away /.
1277,so I think law enforcement was put in a bad position trying to play catchup /.
1278,and I think they 're doing +an amazing job /.
1279,Larry so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence /?
1280,Well it 's very difficult Dan /.
1281,Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body /.
1282,therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death /.
1283,But we do have some physical evidence /.
1284,Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me it was not done the proper way /.
1285,It was n't a forensic photograph /.
1286,So I really do not know how large the stain was in its dimensions /.
1287,but it is pretty clear that there 's a lot of blood there great deal of blood /.
1288,It makes you think that something criminal occured /.
1289,But again getting back to how you solve the crime you got to go to the crime scene /.
1290,and I think there are multiple scenes here /.
1291,Every place there 's blood it 's a crime scene /.
1292,But the most important place is the cabin because that 's presumably where the injury took place /.
1293,Now there was some rumor about some arguments going casino the night before /.
1294,Uh and it could very well be that he was arguing with these individuals /.
1295,so uh that could be the tie the connection /.
1296,and I think good policework would connect the individuals in question with the casino with Mister Smith /.
1297,and that might help us understand what happened /.
1298,this is um a little bit more sound /.
1299,This is again from Cletus Hyman uh who was literally um in a joining or nearby cabin um as to what he heard around he said four in the morning the day before uh Mister Smith went missing /.
1300,At times it sounded like furniture was being actually picked up and dropped /.
1301,and then that horrific uh thud /.
1302,Yeah I mean that sure sounds to me chief like we 're not talking about someone who /-
1303,I mean I guess it 's possible if you 're talking about loud yelling coming /-
1304,Well look if this guy 's right that loud yelling is coming from the cabin right and the wife is not a real suspect here means that there was probably someone else in there /.
1305,Well there absolutely was someone else in that room /.
1306,And what 's interesting is there was a witness who uh had informed ship 's authorities that she had heard a scream uh early that morning /.
1307,And what 's really interesting is uh we do n't know if she 's been interviewed at this point /.
1308,But it was five days later that the ship 's attorneys had begun to question her not law enforcement but ship 's attorneys /.
1309,We will uh continue to follow this /.
1310,Chief Zalisko of the Oakhill Police Department sorry about that Susan Filan Larry Kobilinsky thanks a lot /.
1311,Coming up two mothers both their daughters kidnapped raped killed /.
1312,Join us for the final installment of our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.
1313,And you know I sort of pooh - poohed the idea that two jurors from the Michael Jackson trial are now writing tell - all books saying that they think Michael Jackson 's guilty /.
1314,"You respond to me , coming up /."
1315,Abrams Report at MSNBC dot com is where you send your emails /.
1316,Please include your name where you 're writing from /.
1317,I respond at the end of the show /.
1318,"Coming up , our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose continues with two mothers who lost very loved ones to really these monsters , coming up /."
1319,All week we 've been continuing with our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.
1320,In a moment I 'm going to talk with two very courageous mothers who both lost daughters to sex offenders /.
1321,But first I want to highlight some of the wanted sex offenders running free before they strike /.
1322,This time in New York state /.
1323,Tomas Meddaugh is a oh he 's not thirty that guy 's what fifty alright fifty year old white male five foot seven a hundred and sixty - eight pounds with scars near his left eyebrow and shoulder his neck and abdomen /.
1324,He 's got a prior conviction for rape /.
1325,and his current offense involved deviant sexual intercourse with a thirteen year old girl /.
1326,He 's considered armed and dangerous /.
1327,Francisco Paulino is a forty - six year old Hispanic male five foot nine hundred and forty no scars or tattoos that they know of /.
1328,He does have a prior conviction for the knifepoint rape of a fourteen year old girl /.
1329,He 's violated his parole /.
1330,He 's wanted /.
1331,Dion Bryant twenty - four year old black male standing five foot six one fifty - six /.
1332,Convicted for attempted rape /.
1333,three underage girls involved /.
1334,He too has violated his parole /.
1335,Wanted /.
1336,Anyone with information about their whereabouts should call New York 's a hundred most wanted tipline one eight hundred two six two four three two one and keep in mind that these guys really may be dangerous /.
1337,so /-
1338,Now the women you 're about to meet lost their children to vicious predators /.
1339,Samantha Runnion was uh just eleven days away from her sixth birthday when she was kidnapped sexually assaulted and murdered by a man named Alejandro Avila /.
1340,He 's been sentenced to death for those crimes /.
1341,In choosing to destroy Samantha 's life you chose this /.
1342,You chose to waste your life to satisfy a selfish and sick desire /.
1343,You knew it was wrong /.
1344,and you chose not to think about it /.
1345,Well now you have a lot of time to think about it /.
1346,Do n't waste it /.
1347,Write it down so that the rest of us can figure out how to stop you people /.
1348,You 're a disgrace to the human race /.
1349,And Dru Sjodin was a twenty - two year old college student /.
1350,She was abducted and killed /.
1351,Alfonso Rodriguez a man with prior convictions for assaulting women is facing trial accused of kidnapping and murder /.
1352,Convicted he too uh could get the death penalty /.
1353,Joining me now is Samantha Runnion 's mother Erin Runnion and Dru Sjodin 's mother Linda Walker /.
1354,Thanks so much uh for coming on the program /.
1355,We appreciate it /.
1356,Alright Erin let me start with you /.
1357,What do you think the biggest problem is out there when it comes to these sex offenders /?
1358,Well I think that there 's a gross misconception about sex offender crimes /.
1359,I think most do not realize how pervasive the problem is /.
1360,The sex offenders that we have caught are a very small percentage of those that are out there /.
1361,Statistically one in four girls and as many as one in six to ten boys are sexually assaulted before they are eighteen /.
1362,That 's nationwide /.
1363,This problem is much bigger than I think people are realizing /.
1364,And Linda I guess what we 're realizing as we have been highlighting these wanted sex offenders around the country is how many of them are still out there and wanted /.
1365,Well currently there 's um right now uh over a hundred thousand that are missing /.
1366,Unbelievable /.
1367,Uh we know that there 's over five hundred thousand registered /.
1368,So yes there 's a vast amount that are running uh through the system /.
1369,That 's a May of two thousand five um statistic /.
1370,but as far as those before that time and date /.
1371,Um Linda eh how much has this eh when I say changed your life I mean in addition to the obvious loss of your daughter but in terms of what you are doing everyday with your life /.
1372,both of you have devoted much of your lives to this cause now /.
1373,Linda why do n't you tell me a little bit about what you 've been doing /.
1374,Well um I 've been working with um er pardon me Byron Dorgan Senator of North Dakota /.
1375,um working legislation on what has been uh called Dru 's Law which we hope will be a national sex +offender uh database through computer /.
1376,And um obviously we know that this nation is more and um they 're able to access cross you know state lines /.
1377,so I think it 's important that uh people of predators living amongst us across you know the country and be vigilant uh besides uh leaving the pressure on them /.
1378,Mhm /.
1379,Yeah /.
1380,Erin uh every time I listen to that tape of you um talking to uh your dau- I get chills /.
1381,Um was it at all uh cathartic for you to be able to stand across from him /?
1382,Definitely /.
1383,Definitely I to say what I said to him /.
1384,I needed to address him /.
1385,And I feel like I got it off my chest you know /.
1386,I hope to never ever see him again /.
1387,The whole trial process is really built around the defendant /.
1388,and um it was very important to me that I bring it back around and make it about Samantha because that 's what it was really about /.
1389,Do you watch these other stories uh in the news /.
1390,and does it just get your blood boiling as you see eh these cases where was on the loose should have been arrested could 've been /.
1391,You know the technology is there /.
1392,so yes it infuriates me /.
1393,I ca n't understand why we 're so behind in terms of tracking sex offenders /.
1394,and I really think it 's because people do n't real- /-
1395,there 's no reason that there should n't be a nationwide movement to stop these people . To have them register at the very least have them their driver 's licenses /.
1396,If they do n't they go on a most wanted list /.
1397,it 's made public nationwide /.
1398,At the very least every state could do that /.
1399,it adds to state revenue /.
1400,it does n't take away /.
1401,It 's a good way to track them /.
1402,And I have to just on a personal note applaud Linda /.
1403,I met her before they had found Dru /.
1404,and I 'm so sorry for your loss /.
1405,I think you 're just amazing /.
1406,You 're doing such a job /.
1407,Well as well for you too /.
1408,Thank you /.
1409,Linda are you psychologically prepared uh for this trial /?
1410,I mean eh you know you can tell from seeing on that tape that obviously it 's not easy stuff /.
1411,I mean to sit there next to these guys /.
1412,You know it 's just another part of this whole sick story /.
1413,there 's no script for it /.
1414,I do n't know if anyone could ever be prepared /.
1415,Um obviously it 's something that um we look to have it put behind us so we can really dwell more on what Dru gave us in her life and not how tragically she was taken from us /.
1416,And also I have to say that what both of you are doing in working with legislators uh to move forward uh to not just say we 're going to only look past /.
1417,Both of you are doing /.
1418,and that 's why we 're so um glad and proud to have you both on the program /.
1419,It 's because of what both of you are doing to have things change /.
1420,um and I think that is what 's /-
1421,Go ahead Linda /.
1422,Well and uh thanks goes to you and to the media to help us /.
1423,Absolutely /.
1424,Obviously we could n't scream loud enough uh to bring the attention /.
1425,so our hat is off to all of you as well /.
1426,Yeah /.
1427,Yeah and that 's /-
1428,And to realize you know why we 're out here doing what we 're doing on the scale that we 're able to /.
1429,and that 's why I have to tell you on this special series we 're doing I 'm just getting so tired of hearing these stories about these guys where they were always on the loose and people say oh you know it would have been nice if he was captured /.
1430,Tired of it /.
1431,and as a result you know we 're doing the little bit that we can /.
1432,but you guys are the ones who are really going to get things done /.
1433,Your voices your presence um I think is really the difference /.
1434,and that 's why I thank you both so much for coming on the program /.
1435,Well thank you /.
1436,Well thank you /.
1437,it 's /.
1438,And you know it 's so important we know too /.
1439,Absolutely /.
1440,Absolutely /.
1441,It 's so important that people realize at home that in our own homes in our own lives we can work to prevent these crimes /.
1442,It is really just about uh communicating with neighbors getting a watch going in your community talking /-
1443,Report every suspicious behavior there is /.
1444,You never know /.
1445,It leads to convictions time and time again /.
1446,and Linda Walker thank you both so much for coming on the program /.
1447,Absolutely uh /.
1448,Thank you /.
1449,We really appreciate it /.
1450,Be right back /.
1451,Thank you /.
1452,Thank you Dan /.
1453,I 've had my say /.
1454,now it 's time for your rebuttal /.
1455,Last night I said if the two jurors in the Michael Jackson case are really now saying that he 's guilty that 's shameful /.
1456,Leslie Birdwhistell from Bowling Green Kentucky /.
1457,Man you /.
1458,Ca n't these people step away from the trial and the ten other jurors take in some information that was not presented in court and change their minds about the verdict /?
1459,Uh No /.
1460,It 's too important /.
1461,They saw the evidence /.
1462,The only thing that might 've changed their minds this quickly I think is money or peer pressure neither of which are very good reasons /.
1463,David Becker from Bradenton Florida /.
1464,Why 's it so difficult to believe these jurors believed Michael Jackson was guilty but did n't believe there was sufficient evidence to convict /?
1465,Uh maybe Dave /.
1466,but the Daily News reported that they quote flip - flopped /.
1467,And in our weeklong series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose trying to stop wanted sex offenders before they strike Chris O'Rourke from Gardner Massachusetts /.
1468,I 'm happy that someone 's finally trying to do something to ward off these child attacks before rather than focus on them after /.
1469,from West Hollywood Californ- /-
1470,Dan I know your intentions are good /.

1493,"And with us from the Russian capital Moscow , is Mr. Abdallah Issa ."
1494,"Uh , first , Abdallah , so the visit by Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora is his first visit to Russia in his capacity as the Lebanese Prime Minister ."
1495,"First , what is the planned schedule for this visit ?"
1496,And has Russia entered the fray of solving the Lebanese crisis ?
1497,"Yes , you know , uh , that this visit comes days before the visit of Syrian President Bashar Assad also to , uh , Russia ."
1498,"This means that this visit , Siniora 's visit , has special significance , and that he has issued a clear signal that he is for , uh , building relations or normalizing good relations with neighboring Syria ."
1499,"Russia has not left the region and has not distanced itself from , uh , the Lebanese issue , uh , it had a clear role in , uh , all the discussions that went on at the Security Council , including , uh , the international resolutions ."
1500,Yes .
1501,"You also know uh , that Moscow had , uh , a clear position in the the latest resolution , uh , pertaining to the international tribunal ."
1502,"And it was to a large extent , uh , converging with the position , uh , uh , of the opposition to the so - called government , or the position of the Siniora government , or the majority , the so - called majority in this government ."
1503,"It stood for not letting this resolution constitute a schism in the Lebanese national unity on one hand , and on the other hand , to not constitute any threat to sovereignty and legitimacy , especially in connection with the relationship between the government and the president ."
1504,Yes .
1505,"And with us from Nablus , Palestinian Deputy Prime Minister Nasser el - Dein el - Sha'er ."
1506,"Mr. Sha'er ah what justifies the refusal ah ah of your government to attend the speech by President Mahmoud Abbas tomorrow , and it is assumed to be a speech that interests all Palestinians , with all factions ?"
1507,"No , we are not the concerned with %pw in the first place ."
1508,"This is a speech the President gives to the Palestinian people , he wants to present his point of view on the subject ."
1509,We are not part of this subject ah and we are not part of this speech he will give .
1510,It is a point of view the President sees and wants to give .
1511,"Since we are not partners in this speech , so would we just be an esteemed listener in such a meeting ?"
1512,"Besides the very difficult , intense security state that we urge the President and all the parties in the Palestinian street to put an end to this chaos and this breakdown in security ."
1513,"The problem is not in a speech here or there , but we are absolutely convinced that speeches and lots of speeches in the Palestinian street have come to complicate the situation , and we fear that these speeches ah could increase the tension in the situation ."
1514,"This was a topic of conversation today between me and the President , and I told him that the problem is that such speeches ah will bring interpretations , responses , and reactions , then they might be interpreted in the street into bullets ; we do not need that ."
1515,"We want a government , we want national unity , we want to heal the injuries , we want a good word , not a list of grievances now ."
1516,"Before we talk about a list of grievances , we first want to calm down the Palestinian public , first of all ."
1517,"Ok , Mr. Sha'er -- listen with us to part of a statement by Mr. Sa'id Siam , Minister of the Interior , after an emergency meeting of the council ah of Ministries , then we go back to talk to you ."
1518,"The government asserts that the internal security is the authority of the Ministry of the Interior , and this requires withdrawing the Presidential security forces from the streets and alleys , and the government will discuss this issue and decide on it with President Abu Mazen ."
1519,"Yes , yesterday the Real Estate Lease Law number 87 for the year 79 was under discussion by members of Parliament ."
1520,"What did the comments and positions of the members focus on , particularly in regard to Paragraph 14 of Article 19 ?"
1521,"Yes , in the Name of God Most Merciful Most Compassionate , this is a law that existed at the time of the former regime ."
1522,"The validity of a previous law that pertains to leasing contracts between tenants and landlords or owners , was going to end the protection period for the tenant , so to speak , in 2004 ."
1523,"However , at the beginning of 2004 , following the military operations , it was a period of occupation , and the Ruling Council deemed it appropriate to extend it for two more years , which ended this year , in 2006 ."
1524,"Today , the Assembly is discussing this issue and wants to extend it another year or two , since the abnormal conditions today in Iraq are not appropriate to impose rates for house leases as they are at the market rate , particularly with respect to the residential aspect ."
1525,"This , of course , does n't affect the commercial aspect ."
1526,"Uh , and consequently , there was , uh , uh , fiery debate in the Council of Representatives ."
1527,Some see it on the basis that people are in control of their money .
1528,"There is a right of the landlord , a right of the owner , and some houses have leases at a meager rate , an old rate , uh , before the rate of the dinar increased or was at today 's exchange rate ."
1529,"People 's economic standard rose over the past three or four years , and consequently , we must reconsider , since the law includes a review of the leases ."
1530,"The other side sees , and this was our point of view really , that the economic situation today in Iraq is a deplorable situation ."
1531,"According to the official statistics that the Iraqi state has , about 40 percent of the people are at or below the poverty line , and this is a very high proportion ."
1532,"Therefore , these people do not have the capabilities of paying I mean , high rental fees ."
1533,There has to be sufficient protection for him by the state .
1534,"Housing projects have to be provided by the state to the weak , incapable social classes ."
1535,These projects have not been provided so far .
1536,"Uh , and there is also another problem that was recently added , which is the problem of sectarian criminal displacement ."
1537,"Yes , doctor ."
1538,Mr. Hassan Nasrallah talked about outside support for the government .
1539,"The government claims that there is no outside influence on its decisions , while the West says that the Lebanese government is a Western project ."
1540,How do you read this equation ?
1541,"Regardless of what the Lebanese government says , there are obvious positions from Israel and from the new conservatives in the United States of America ."
1542,Yes .
1543,"They use the state of internal contradiction in Lebanon regarding the issue of the authority and regarding the management of the authority in the country as an entrance and a means to justify the attack on the region and to justify the scheme of the neo-conservatives , who suffered several failures and kept falling , one after the other , inside America ."
1544,"So you find that they are trying to re-fix and produce their project in the region , maybe it would reflect on the American inside , and to abort ah ah the report of the Baker - Hamilton commission , which appeared yesterday and which carries in its pages a project opposing a project of the neo-conservatives ."
1545,<1542.5365:1543.099> Ah --
1546,Yes .
1547,"So , this plan is obvious that using the Lebanese front , and using the position of the Lebanese government , whether it wanted or not , in order to be serving the interests of the foreigner ."
1548,"Yes , I mean , can we say that the insistence , of the governing team not to step down , the reason for it is not the strength of its position , but the outside support for it ?"
1549,"It is obvious to you this issue has become obvious for everyone , especially after some Arab countries entered the battlefield in Lebanon in an obvious way , and they considered themselves the concerned party with that struggle and threat by sending troops to Lebanon to fight in defense of that situation ."
1550,"We consider that heating up the head of the Lebanese government , especially that the will of the opposition is heading in the direction of creating a slogan under the headline of a Coalition Government ."
1551,Yes .
1552,"The intention is not to exclude anyone , neither to isolate anyone ."
1553,The intention is to form a state of national participation to protect the main principles and the national strategy in the country .
1554,"We mentioned in the news earlier , ah , on that there were over a hundred flights , and tens of thousands of people might be affected ."
1555,So do we know right now if there is any new progress in the investigation .
1556,"Er , or I should say that the investigation is , eh , I should say , being aggressively carried out right now , ah ."
1557,"Right now a total of 221 flights are affected , involving about , eh , 33,000 passengers ."
1558,"Currently , these passengers , eh , have now , this , mainly flown by these three flights at , this , the end of this month ,"
1559,"They were quite dispersed , some to Madrid , some to , eh , Barcelona , some to Athens , some to Stockholm , and there were also some to Turkey , what to Austria ."
1560,"Therefore , right now , eh , the British authorities , eh , that is to say , are appealing to these passengers , eh , er , to report their , eh , situations to , eh , the British health department as soon as possible ."
1561,"At the same time , eh , er , they have especially set up a hotline , um , hoping that everyone would call in ."
1562,"Well , till now , eh , the latest count is about 450 people , eh , er , eh , who then have , eh , reported their health condition , eh , to the related British department ."
1563,"Of these , the British , eh , er , Health Department , eh , has followed up on 18 people ."
1564,"Er , among them , there were three major ones , eh , er , and they were transferred to this special hospital , eh , for treatment ."
1565,I see that in 2002 the increase in the number of people signing up for the public service exam reached eighty - nine percent .
1566,"By 2003 , eh , the percentage of the increase hit ninety - five percent ."
1567,"In 2004 , eh , it reached 197 percent ."
1568,"Then , in 2005 , it hit 50.3 percent ."
1569,"Well , how is the situation this year ."
1570,This year applications are still really hot .
1571,Hot to what degree .
1572,"Let 's put it this way , ah , this year central government institutions , eh , and their subordinate organizations have provided more than twelve thousand posts , while the number of people applying broke through the one million mark ."
1573,Uh-huh .
1574,"Uh , over twelve thousand posts , with the number of applicants exceeding one million ."
1575,That 's one percent .
1576,Right .
1577,"That is , it was one percent of the number of people ."
1578,"Yes , yes ."
1579,"But we still have to explain a bit what 's going on inside , eh , these figures ."
1580,Uh-huh .
1581,"Actually , the number of people who actually take the confirmation exam is now more than 530,000 ."
1582,"And , eh , the recruitment ratio is also one in more than forty ."
1583,"Uh , approximately one in about forty ."
1584,"That is to say , that there are about forty people competing for eh , one position ."
1585,Uh-huh .
1586,"Judging from the level of competition , these few years , eh , have also shown a steadily increasing trend ."
1587,"I 've heard , um , for certain particularly hot positions , it can be said to reach a thousand to one ."
1588,"So , as long as it is an independent brand name , ah , in addition to the expansion of your own company , you would naturally assume a type of responsibility ."
1589,"Therefore in this process , eh , it is not only an operation with your own brand , and not only a domestic market - oriented approach with your own say , you can even create more opportunities for such cooperation in the global market , and the kind of operation that is geared toward our interests ."
1590,"Therefore in this case , from the interest of the country , and from the , er , benefits on the part of both clients and partners , all these areas manifest the existence value of the enterprise Chery ."
1591,"I know , people working in Chery have a saying : We will fight 20 years to have our own brand name ."
1592,"eh , from the time Chery was founded to now , half of that time has already gone by ."
1593,"In the remaining half , which is the next ten years , will we see a more brilliant Chery for sure ."
1594,Yes .
1595,"This Comrade Zhang Hailai has continued to teach us , saying that the people in the car industry should not be crazy , otherwise they will be killed ."
1596,"So , we have already been crazy for the past ten years ."
1597,I think the next ten years is a decade that Chery needs to be even crazier .
1598,"Of course together let us wish that Chery , and wish that China would stand out from the crowd among the future competition within the car industry and break through all kinds of difficulties , and really bring honor to the people of China ."
1599,"I heard your friends say this , eh , saying that there is half of Ding Naizhu in Lai Shengchuan , and half of Lai Shengchuan in Ding Naizhu ."
1600,What does this mean .
1601,"Yes , I ah , can agree ."
1602,Can you .
1603,Yes .
1604,"The reason is because we two actually have very , very , different personalities ."
1605,Eh .
1606,Because in actual fact we well complement each other .
1607,Oh .
1608,"Er , ordinary people would think , um , that he is probably , eh , that is , more heedless , or , I do n't know , uh , maybe I appear more careful ."
1609,Yes .
1610,"Actually , we two are the exact opposite , he is very careful , very careful ."
1611,Oh .
1612,Yes .
1613,"And I am careless , when I put something away , it will be lost or it will be missing ."
1614,"Like me , this , many , this --"
1615,"However , we two , that is , complement each other very , very well ."
1616,"Like in the troupe , ah , er , I actually decide the general direction of the whole troupe ."
1617,Yes .
1618,"for instance , I will decide on the way the troupe will proceed ."
1619,I am the one who focuses on this big direction .
1620,Oh .
1621,"Usually , it does not matter to him ."
1622,"He is on the production side , like this , oh ."
1623,"Eh , but whenever it pertains to the details , eh , he is detailed , and he is very clear ."
1624,Yes .
1625,I heard that Mr. Lai will even slice cabbage very finely and delicately .
1626,Yes .
1627,"Very much so ,"
1628,"everything he does , he wants the ambience to be just so , he is particular about the atmosphere , very particular ."
1629,"He cooks , we both like to cook ."
1630,Yes .
1631,"When I cook , I cook , I can cook under any circumstance ."
1632,Yes .
1633,"When he cooks , he needs to put on the music , ah , the light , the music ."
1634,Like this --
1635,"Oh yes , so when he cooks , it 's very troublesome ."
1636,Yes .
1637,"A mentally ill person can do some terrible things , right ."
1638,"He may kill other people , and not have to bear any legal responsibilities ."
1639,So what should be done .
1640,"Hence the entire police , the entire social system should begin to monitor the mental state of the people ."
1641,"Oh , this point of yours reminds me of that situation of Foucault ."
1642,"Yes , that 's right , which is to start monitoring mental conditions ."
1643,How to go about monitoring .
1644,For instance mental health is greatly emphasized in schools .
1645,"Er , there are many hospitals and social workers in the community , right ."
1646,"Social workers they have to extensively visit different family communities , to see whether the members of this family , ah , are arguing all the time , or whether there is a great deal of marital discord between wife and husband ."
1647,"They , eh , greatly advocated the popularization of psychiatrists ."
1648,"So do you remember , when you , Mr. Xu , first went to the United States , you felt that the Americans were so abnormal for seeing psychiatrists even for minor issues ."
1649,Uh-huh .
1650,"In this kind of society like theirs , it 's not all that unusual to see a psychiatrist ."
1651,They have normalized that .
1652,"This is how , eh , the entire community keeps monitoring everyone 's mental state ."
1653,"Of course , what all investors are most concerned about is , how long will this wave , this trend of appreciation last ."
1654,"Also , eh , to enter at a time like this , for example , in Hong Kong , he can directly invest in the Renminbi , would it be profitable to enter the market right now ."
1655,Uh .
1656,"I believe that the appreciation of the RMB , eh , it will , er , be on a rising trend for a quite long time to come , because this is related to the , this , conditions of savings in China itself ."
1657,And behind the change in savings is a factor of demographics .
1658,"Right now in China 's , this , eh , a relatively large proportion of the population are young adults , and these people have higher savings , as they have to save for their children 's education , and for their own retirement ."
1659,Yes .
1660,"Therefore , during , eh , the middle of this stage , er , the high savings has resulted in a larger surplus in China 's regular accounts ."
1661,So this trend will last for a period of time .
1662,But the issue is that the appreciation right now should be viewed as a gradual appreciation on a small scale .
1663,"So right now if you ask whether or not it will be profitable , eh , to exchange , this , other currencies into Renminbi , we will need to look at , this , this , the deficit ."
1664,"Um , this is the first time I 've seen you , and I 've always wanted to ask you a question ."
1665,Ah .
1666,"Usually directors , otherwise , they have beards and very long hair , or otherwise they shave their heads ."
1667,Oh .
1668,Oh ! I had n't thought about that .
1669,"Actually a shaved head is really hard to manage , is n't it ?"
1670,Do you have to shave it every day ?
1671,"Right , yes ."
1672,"Um , when I 've slept so much I ca n't wake up , I just shave my head and I 'm awake ."
1673,And do you need to polish it somehow ?
1674,Then do you rub a little oil of some kind on it ?
1675,"Oh , after I shave it I rub on a little oil ."
1676,Is it cold in the winter ?
1677,Pretty cold .
1678,Do you wear a hat ?
1679,In the winter ?
1680,It forces me to wear a hat .
1681,That 's a question I 've always wanted to ask .
1682,"Um , I 'm sure that there are many people when they introduce you , aside from saying Director Ye Daying who has shot such and such , they ca n't avoid the cliche , they always have to say "" I 'd like to introduce Marshall Ye Ting 's grandson . """
1683,"Your father , Ye Zhengming , was Marshall Ye Ting 's second child ."
1684,Right .
1685,Oh !
1686,But today we 're telling Ye Daying 's story .
1687,Let 's start with when you were young .
1688,When you were young you were very naughty .
1689,Ye Daying was born in Changchun in 1958 .
1690,"Although by that time his grandfather Ye Ting had been dead for 12 years , the Ye family maintained its status as a highly esteemed Communist household ."
1691,"The next year the entire family transferred to Beijing , and Ye Daying spent his childhood there ."
1692,"He and his little friends went fishing , raised dogs , hunted sparrows , chased ducks , and many years later these supremely happy memories are all preserved in his movies and plays ."
1693,"One , two , three , four ."
1694,Ducks were the most precious asset in our village .
1695,The village mayor gave them all to me .
1696,"The mayor said to me , there are eighty - six in all ;"
1697,he had me check to see that there were none missing .
1698,But I never did count them all carefully .
1699,"77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86"
1700,Did you see ?
1701,Are there 86 of them ?
1702,Yes .
1703,"Ye Daying 's mother , An Qi , was an educated woman who worked at the Changchun Film Studio ."
1704,"And his father , Ye Zhengming , was an outstanding son of the revolution ."
1705,Because after the Wannan Incident Ye Zhengming and his father Ye Ting were imprisoned for two years in a Kuomnintang prison .
1706,"But then , and for the same reasons , just after the Cultural Revolution started , Ye Zhengming was treated as a major capitalist roader ."
1707,That year Ye Daying was just eight years old .
1708,His family 's sudden misfortune left the young Ye Daying with very disturbing memories .
1709,He changed from a very well - behaved child into a naughty child .
1710,"From that time on he often did things that went beyond the norm , sometimes to protect himself and sometimes to take care of his family ."
1711,Ye Daying just corrected us ; he said that Ye Ting should not be called Marshal Ye Ting but rather General Ye Ting .
1712,"Right , right , right , General Ye Ting ."
1713,"Why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?"
1714,"Um , he died in '46 ."
1715,"That marshal , afterward , after Liberation , um , it was conferred on him , so only then --"
1716,"OK , we 'll call him General Ye Ting ."
1717,Mm .
1718,"Because ,"
1719,Very naughty ?
1720,To what extent were you naughty then ?
1721,In fact I was a very well - behaved child .
1722,"But I was , forced into it , , if you were n't naughty there was no way to survive ."
1723,What do you mean forced into it ?
1724,"During the Cultural Revolution , , um , my family was considered capitalist roaders ."
1725,"So the kids then did n't want to play with you , or they would tease you , that sort of thing ."
1726,Mm .
1727,"So you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,"
1728,Why was that ?
1729,"Was it because people for example would say that your father was such and such , or your family was such and such ."
1730,Right .
1731,So it was because of that sort of thing ?
1732,"Right , the majority of it was like that ."
1733,Mm .
1734,Mm .
1735,"Because you had to face them alone , OK , a dozen people who wanted to fight you ."
1736,"You had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough ."
1737,"So that was , the only way you could overcome them and get the upper hand ."
1738,Mm .
1739,Were you tough ?
1740,Mm .
1741,Very tough .
1742,Tough enough to --
1743,"Because , there was no way , if you were n't tough that was it , , how could you manage ."
1744,"You were the son of capitalist roaders , , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it 's perfectly normal ."
1745,Mm .
1746,", I remember one time , we were digging out an air - raid shelter , that --"
1747,"Those , good kids , they went there and threw stones ."
1748,"I did n't dare defend myself , so I just had to endure it for quite a while ."
1749,Mm .
1750,"Finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on the head , And I got angry , so angry that I rushed out with a shovel and hit them with the shovel ."
1751,Where did the shovel come from ?
1752,"From digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right ."
1753,Mm .
1754,So you picked up the shovel and rushed them .
1755,Did you crack somebody 's head open ?
1756,"Mm , anyhow , yes , I cracked their head open , it was very tragic ."
1757,All of a sudden nobody was making a sound .
1758,Very --
1759,"Once I fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me ."
1760,How many of them did you take out ?
1761,I hit one of them and that was enough .
1762,Nopbody went to get the schoolmaster or somebody 's father ?
1763,"They did , and there was a huge fuss ."
1764,Mm .
1765,"Because when I was little , having a big fight like that ."
1766,Mm .
1767,"Anyhow , more or less , , on average , every two years I changed school , and that 's how it had to be ."
1768,Mm .
1769,"I remember one time -- Mm , also , when I was in fifth or sixth grade , someone yelled out , Down with Ye Zhengming , he was yelling at me , and I had to fight them ."
1770,Mm .
1771,"After the fight I went home , and my father was standing far away ."
1772,", the factory , , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters Down with Ye Zhengming , , the slogan ."
1773,Mm .
1774,"I got accustomed to it while passing by at that time , and now when I think about it , it seems very much like a stage play ."
1775,Mm .
1776,"Back then I felt , looking at him standing so far away --"
1777,"I walked over to him , and he said , um , you really do n't understand anything ."
1778,At the time I felt like I had a grievance .
1779,"And I felt , I was fighting for you , the people were cursing you , and I was fighting them ."
1780,In fact that 's the way kids think .
1781,Mm .
1782,"You think , you bastard ."
1783,What you say does n't count .
1784,you come after me and I 'll take you down .
1785,"You come down , and I 'll take you down ."
1786,"If you have balls , you come on down ."
1787,Come on down .
1788,Come down .
1789,"Come down , come on , fight , fight , fight ."
1790,I say you take a whack .
1791,Whack .
1792,"I 'm telling you , if you kill somebody you 'll pay with your life , do you understand ?"
1793,", You 've already handed him over ."
1794,I sent someone .
1795,"OK , OK , I sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at me ."
1796,"Come on , take a whack at me ."
1797,Take a whack at me .
1798,Your dad knows who broke the window .
1799,Take a whack .
1800,Take a whack .
1801,Take a whack .
1802,Are n't you willing to be friends with us ?
1803,"Yes , I am ."
1804,He says he 's willing .
1805,Did you hear ?
1806,He says he 's willing .
1807,"Ok , that 's all right , let 's go play ."
1808,"This is a movie directed by Ye , called There 's a Place Called Wangjiazhan ."
1809,"Wangjiazhuang , right ."
1810,"This is obviously him as a boy , uh , a memory of his childhood life ."
1811,Right .
1812,Right .
1813,Which child is you .
1814,"Is this child you , or is that child you ?"
1815,"Actually we should be accurate ; this child 's experiences ,"
1816,"So this child ,"
1817,"Um , right , right , right , because once , I"
1818,"My father was denounced , and then the rebels took us , took that child to see ."
1819,Mm .
1820,"They denounced my father , so I was very indignant ,"
1821,"They let a lot of people expose my father ,"
1822,Mm .
1823,"Then the day after I took a kitchen knife and ran over to their home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that I 'd hack the guy up ."
1824,A kitchen knife ; a knife from your kitchen at home .
1825,"Oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home ."
1826,"Then I was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n't just hack people up ."
1827,But I had already said it .
1828,What did you say ?
1829,"said I have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like this child ."
1830,"But , those adults standing around reasoned with me , said look , you do n't understand this ."
1831,"If you do this , you 'll stir up more trouble , and then wo n't your dad be even worse off ?"
1832,"In fact when they said that , my mind had already eased ."
1833,"I could not lose the face this way , , So then I ran over and took a whack at the door , to get an excuse for myself ."
1834,Was it all ruined ? The door --
1835,I slashed it twice .
1836,"Um , was n't there any consequence ?"
1837,"Mm , there was no consequence , , I just let the adults reason with me ."
1838,"Mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years ."
1839,"It , had a great influence on me ."
1840,"Including that village , that environment , it 's all very familiar to you ."
1841,"More or less , very close to me , this is a novel of ."
1842,Mm .
1843,Mm .
1844,", the reason I like it is because , um , it brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories ."
1845,"Mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in Beijing ."
1846,What year was it that you moved to Shanghai ?
1847,How old were you at that time ?
1848,", In '69 I was 11 years old ."
1849,Mm .
1850,"Mm , well ."
1851,In '69 at the age of 11 you went from Beijing to Shanghai .
1852,"Mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n't completely passed ."
1853,"Mm , as he puts it , looking at it now , some of the memories can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days ."
1854,"I went there every day and then they suspended classes , , so I could n't go to school , could n't go to class ."
1855,Mm .
1856,"So , later I remember there was -- Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves ."
1857,"A lot of people were very happy , very excited , because they were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?"
1858,"Right , but the problem --"
1859,"Because , I had never studied well ,"
1860,"In 1966 the Great Cultural Revolution came , and at that time Ye Daying 's family moved from Beijing to Shanghai to live ."
1861,"His father Ye Zhengming was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day ."
1862,And the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of Ye Daying 's life .
1863,He was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .
1864,When you got to Shanghai the environment changed ; did n't your whole person change ?
1865,"After I got to Shanghai , , settling into , , that ,"
1866,"All that time , from '69 to '76 , I graduated from senior middle school , it all took place there ."
1867,Mm .
1868,"At that time in school , there were some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in that class ?"
1869,"Right , right , , see , like study classes to educate good kids ."
1870,What kind of people were in your class ?
1871,Um .
1872,"Anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say they were little hooligans , they were all mixed in together in that class , and there were also some who had problems at home ."
1873,Mm .
1874,"All of them , and every day I went there , and the classes were suspended , , so they did n't let me go to school , did n't let me go to class ."
1875,Mm .
1876,"So , afterward , I remember there was Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves ."
1877,Lots of fun .
1878,Mm .
1879,"So I was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study ."
1880,"In fact it was n't that we did n't study , I think it was ,"
1881,"This class really helped me a lot , , sometimes in my life I think about this ,"
1882,Mm .
1883,That period was both a happy and a fun time .
1884,Because I was a good egg .
1885,In this I go against the grain .
1886,"Um , the thing is , , they 're all the same ."
1887,"If you 're bad , you do what you want , and so , you 're honest and so it 's easy to be free ."
1888,"Plus when you yourself have already decided that you 're a bad kid , then , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you 're completely liberated and free ."
1889,I think that --
1890,"Um , of course today we say , at that time , um , in that class of ours , they were n't all necessarily bad kids ."
1891,Mm .
1892,They just were n't like normal kids .
1893,", it was like a brotherhood ."
1894,"Ah , and we did some things that were out of bounds ."
1895,"Mm , we helped each other ."
1896,"Very sincere , very sincere and good ."
1897,"When he was in that class , Ye Daying received patient teaching every day ."
1898,At that time he encountered the first love of his life that still remains fresh in his memory .
1899,This girl became the only light in Ye Daying 's dark life for several years .
1900,"In those days if a middle school student liked a fellow - student , how did he go about expressing that ?"
1901,Um .
1902,"When I was a school kid , for example , Um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , I liked her ."
1903,Mm .
1904,"I always felt , um , she can , give you more on your plate , put more things on your plate for you to eat ."
1905,"And then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together ."
1906,Mm .
1907,"It was ,"
1908,"So already you could -- Go see a movie ; I thought ,"
1909,"That was it , that was it ."
1910,"You just want to go see the movie , you do n't worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , --"
1911,So you went to the movies with this girl ?
1912,Yes .
1913,Do you still remember what movies you saw ?
1914,The Flower Girl .
1915,I still remember that now .
1916,Mm .
1917,She cried as hard as she could .
1918,So seeing The Flower Girl was the equivalent of seeing Titanic now .
1919,"Oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry ."
1920,"Yes , crying her eyes out , a big film like that ."
1921,At the time I thought I would n't cry .
1922,"But the people all around were crying , and I thought if I did n't cry it would look bad ."
1923,So then you cried .
1924,"So then I thought , I should let my emotions go ."
1925,"Um , how was the girl , was she very pretty ?"
1926,", now I remember that she was very pretty , mm ."
1927,Mm .
1928,She was a very good student .
1929,"Ha ha , this --"
1930,How was it she liked you ?
1931,"At that time we did n't talk about it , if two people gave each other the eye and felt it was right , then ,"
1932,"Gave each other the eye , while you were in the class you gave each other the eye ."
1933,", so , when we were in class , for example you ,"
1934,"I remember how it happened , yes ."
1935,"Um . When we went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic ."
1936,Mm .
1937,Mm .
1938,"So then , we 'd each pick up a piece of chalk and toss the chalk back and forth . And throw spitballs ."
1939,"I threw it at someone else but missed , and it hit her ."
1940,The result was that she turned her head to look .
1941,And she looked at you angrily .
1942,"I thought , uh-oh , the expression in her eyes was like she would forgive you , that kind of feeling ."
1943,"I thought wow , it 's so wonderful , that kind of feeling ."
1944,Mm .
1945,"That 's how it was , I should say ."
1946,It was like that ?
1947,Mm .
1948,"Many years later , afterward , we graduated from senior middle school , and I was still going to see her ."
1949,Mm .
1950,The --
1951,", so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right ."
1952,You graduated from middle school in '73 .
1953,'74 .
1954,Mm .
1955,Graduated from midle school in '74 .
1956,"Mm , that female schoolmate went to the Shanghai suburbs to live and work ."
1957,"Right , right , yes ."
1958,"Ye Daying went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were , forty - some yuan ?"
1959,"Mm , when I started it was a technical school ."
1960,"Then at first it was 13 yuan , the first year 13 yuan ; the second year it was 15 yuan , and the third year it was 41 yuan ."
1961,Mm .
1962,Mm .
1963,"41 yuan , at the time , for him , it was , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money ."
1964,It was a lot of money .
1965,"In 1976 , there were two happy events in the Ye family ."
1966,"The first was that his father , Ye Zhengming , was released and reunited with his family that he had been separated from for three years ."
1967,The second event was that Ye Daying had his 18th birthday and became an adult .
1968,"With the turn for the better in his father 's political circumstances , Ye Daying left behind his violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking ."
1969,"In 1978 the big news was that the college entrance exams would be reinstated nationwide , and people of Ye Daying 's age were thrilled ."
1970,"However , at this time Ye Daying , facing this opportunity that would change his fortune , was at a loss as to what to do ."
1971,"You thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?"
1972,"Oh my , in fact , '78 , for me , was an especially depressing time ."
1973,Mm .
1974,Mm .
1975,"Up to then , um , I had never thought about the future ."
1976,Mm .
1977,"I thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -LRB- factory -RRB- worker ."
1978,"In society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead ."
1979,"Um , in '78 suddenly they reinstated the college entrance exams ."
1980,"At that time , in '78 , I was 20 ."
1981,"A lot of people were happy , very excited , because they reinstated the college entrance exams ; why were you feeling depressed ?"
1982,"Right , but the problem was , , Because , I had never done well in school ."
1983,"So right off I felt that I was finished , --"
1984,"Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school , , compared to me , they had a future , um , they could stand out ."
1985,Mm .
1986,"So I was hopeless , right off I was feeling down ."
1987,Very clearly a --
1988,"If you wanted to take the exams , what kind of score did you think you 'd get ."
1989,"I did n't take the exams , I did n't have the nerve , I did n't try , so --"
1990,", the extraordinary thing was , at that time my mom was attending the film institute , she was an instructor there ."
1991,Mm .
1992,"Mm , I had n't thought , , that I would work in the movie ."
1993,Mm .
1994,", um , she wanted to send the recruitment announcement to a friend 's house ."
1995,Mm .
1996,So then I --
1997,"One day she sent me to deliver it , and so I picked it up and read it , and once I read it , oh ! The directing department of the film institute , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and I thought wow ! This is just the ticket ."
1998,Let 's run off to try and see .
1999,"I thought you 've loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , I want to be a director ."
2000,"No , I did n't , no ."
2001,"It was just because there was no English exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry ."
2002,"Right , it was very simple ."
2003,Mm .
2004,"One more thing , because in '78 , the Beijing Film Institute was recruiting students in Shanghai --"
2005,Right .
2006,"So , Ye Daying went to take the exams for the film institute , but did n't pass the exams ."
2007,"His mother , An Qi , had never thought that Ye Daying would sign up to take the exam for her work unit , the Beijing Film Institute ."
2008,But Ye Daying in fact failed when he took the reinstated exam .
2009,"Although it was the first time he had taken the exam , it left Ye Daying even more convinced that movies were something he could do ."
2010,"The next year , 21 - year - old Ye Daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at the Xi'an Film Studio ."
2011,Being an actor was not his goal ; he hoped rather to get into the directing profession .
2012,"At that time you especially admired directors , right ?"
2013,"Mm , because after I got to the Xi'an Film Studio , um , I discovered I had the shakes when I got on stage ."
2014,Mm .
2015,"Mm . Now , here chatting with you , I feel , um , it does n't matter ."
2016,"Even today , in front of the lens , I 'm a nervous wreck ."
2017,"Mm , very tense ."
2018,Did you act then ?
2019,"Of course , every day we had to , um , it was n't just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that ."
2020,"I thought , this is definitely not working ."
2021,Just getting on stage gave you the shakes .
2022,"Then , , no , it was n't my thing , this , I could n't find out why , and besides in those days ,"
2023,"Um , it was in '80 that I went to the Xi'an Film Studio ,"
2024,Mm .
2025,"At that time , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing ."
2026,"And I 'm not that kind of person , so I could n't get my bearings ."
2027,"So then at the same time when I saw that Teng Wenji , he was probably thirty - some years old , he was the previous generation to us , very stubborn ."
2028,Mm .
2029,Mm .
2030,"That projecting force of his , I thought wow , , that 's really good ."
2031,He could really project .
2032,"Because ultimately , there , I gradually realized this ."
2033,Mm .
2034,And I would be in the audience and see him directing on site .
2035,Mm .
2036,"Mm , I could see how they worked ."
2037,"In fact in the beginning the attraction to movies was all these things , I thought it was really a bunch of fluff , I thought , that 's really fun , that 's really interesting ."
2038,"I thought who was stubborn , then I wanted to be that kind of person , but that did n't mean I knew anything about that profession ."
2039,So no one ever came looking for you to do a play ?
2040,At that time --
2041,"Mm , no one ever came looking -- ."
2042,"They looked , but it was always just for an extra ."
2043,", you did n't even have any lines ."
2044,Mm .
2045,"That Xi'an Incident thing , I played an extra once ."
2046,"There was a guy playing Zhang Xueliang , and I played his secretary going in to report to him , and I did it a few times but I was always in the wrong place ."
2047,What were your lines supposed to be ?
2048,"It was "" reporting , a telegram "" that sort of thing ."
2049,So you --
2050,"So I had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful ."
2051,"So after I gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing ."
2052,"So the old director , Cheng Yin , um ,"
2053,Mm .
2054,"He would say , this is An Qi 's son , why is he like that ?"
2055,Do you remember how many takes you did ?
2056,"Oh , a lot ."
2057,I think it was something like ten plus times .
2058,"It was too , I 'd walk badly and turn like that ."
2059,", I attended that class for half a year , um , um and then I got sick ."
2060,"Um , I got , , an inflammation of the central nervous system , so my whole body was paralyzed ."
2061,Your whole body was paralyzed ?
2062,Right .
2063,Your whole body was paralyzed ?
2064,Right . I was paralyzed for ten months .
2065,So you could n't move at all .
2066,I could n't move at all .
2067,"When it started , my leg went numb , then my hand went numb , and then it started cross over , like that , and then slowly , slowly , slowly I could n't move ."
2068,What 's the scientific name of the disease ?
2069,It 's called Guillain - Barre Syndrome .
2070,It 's named after a foreigner .
2071,Mm .
2072,"Ahem , if naming it somewhat common , it 's , a paralysis of the central nervous system , um , it goes from the nerve endings to the flesh , and , then it turns into myasthenia ."
2073,"And how did you get better , later ?"
2074,Hormones .
2075,You took hormones .
2076,"Um , , every day I had a transfusion ."
2077,"Mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat ."
2078,Mm .
2079,Very fat .
2080,"I 'm so fat now , but compared to then it 's much better , in fact ."
2081,At that time how fat were you ?
2082,Yah .
2083,"Getting so fat , it was this , if I looked down I could see my own cheeks , so I thought I was really fat ."
2084,What do you mean ?
2085,"If I just look down , my cheeks are right here ."
2086,"But after they finished with the hormones , I gradually got better ."
2087,Mm .
2088,"The flesh all atrophied , um ."
2089,"If you look at when I was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --"
2090,"Later , based on that , it all evaporated ."
2091,"I 've heard it said that that Wang Shuo novel , which we later saw as a television play --"
2092,"Sometimes , oh , right ."
2093,Mm .
2094,Get some fun .
2095,Get some fun .
2096,"The language in that , the part Wang Zhiwen played , the disease he got is about the same as your disease , is n't it ?"
2097,"Right , right , right , right ."
2098,"So sometimes , oh , it was me and Wang Shuo , together , it was , um , in '89 ."
2099,"Mm , together , um , wrote a -- ."
2100,"Aye , the script I wanted , the novel he wrote , um , that piece we created together ."
2101,Mm .
2102,"Therefore , at that time , we were talking and talking to shoot , an urban love story , tell a love story , so he took me , at that time , , more or less that story , as background ."
2103,Mm .
2104,"Then after I went back to Beijning , when we made arrangement and were eating together , I saw Wang Shuo for the first time"
2105,"Then , when I saw him for the first time , Wang Shuo was holding a book in his arms , a book , that was Floating on the Sea , that novel he wrote , it was a sample ."
2106,Mm .
2107,"Gave it to me , and I took it back to school to read ."
2108,"I read it and wow , that day , I thought he would be able --"
2109,"Our generation could really find ourselves , I mean --"
2110,"Um , in the end I knew we --"
2111,"Why we studied movies , um , and why wrote things , expressing one 's own kind of thing is the most accurate person"
2112,"Ye Daying had already read Wang Shuo 's novel Love the Hard Way , and the story and the style it was written in made a profound impression on him ."
2113,"He sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express ."
2114,"Later he was introduced by a friend , and Ye Daying met the author of the novel , Wang Shuo , at the film institute ."
2115,"That was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today ."
2116,How many plays did you collaborate on ?
2117,"Today , U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen promised to catch and punish those responsible for the bombing of the `` Cole '' and defended the Navy 's decision to refuel ships in Yemen as investigators continued their day at work ."
2118,Morton Dean reports it 's a difficult day for the sailors remaining on board .
2119,"The stressful , monumental task for the crew on the U.S. carrier suffered a setback ."
2120,The ship began to take on water and lost electrical power again .
2121,A difficult time became even more difficult .
2122,It led to the cancellation of a memorial service planned for the 17 sailors who lost their lives .
2123,"Details are becoming known about the damage , most obvious , the huge hole , but also the deck is buckled ."
2124,Even the superstructure is damaged .
2125,Hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed .
2126,"Rear Admiral Mark Fitzgerald , who visited the Cole , was stunned by the damage ."
2127,"I wo n't tell you whether the ship is going to sink or not sink , but there was considerable damage to the ship ."
2128,"According to U.S. officials here tonight , the most important questions about the attack remain unanswered ."
2129,"Any details or speculation on who specifically , we do n't know that at this point ."
2130,"With well over 100 U.S. investigators now in Yemen , the search for evidence is now fully under way ."
2131,"It 's been officially designated `` Operation Determined Response , '' and that suggests several things that the U.S. , of course , is determined to discover who carried out the bombing and that any group who helped plan the attack faces a response from the U.S. military ."
2132,The U.S. believes there are anti-American terror groups based in Yemen .
2133,"Half the population lives in settlements with 500 people or less , and senior U.S. officials here say the government , although friendly to the United States , does not have full control over the entire country ."
2134,"Yemen 's President has repeatedly said an internal explosion rocked the `` USS Cole , '' but tomorrow U.S. officials expect him to announce that he has changed his mind , and tomorrow , the search for bodies will resume ."
2135,Ten U.S. sailors are still missing .
2136,"Morton Dean , Yemen ."
2137,"To learn more about Yemen , go to our website at abcnews.com ."
2138,The remains of four sailors killed in the `` USS Cole '' bombing returned to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware today .
2139,"They were the last of the dead to be flown home , but in Yemen , the search for those responsible for the bombing continues ."
2140,Investigators turned up new evidence and more leads today .
2141,ABC 's John Miller reports .
2142,"Investigators have searched at least half a dozen homes around the port of Aden including this one , trying to retrace the movements of what they believe may be six or more suspects ."
2143,This house on Al Zaharah Street half a mile from the port is where investigators believe the bomb was built into the boat that carried it .
2144,"Just after the men moved in , neighbors say they erected a metal corrugated wall to block the neighbors ' view of the yard ."
2145,Investigators say the men who lived here worked on the boat behind these walls in the last few days of their stay almost constantly .
2146,"At first , neighbors were curious , but later they complained about the noise ."
2147,"On the day of the bombing , neighbors saw the boat leaving through these gates pulled by a Nissan 4 x 4 truck ."
2148,"The trip from the house to the harbor was only about a mile , then six miles by water to the spot where the American destroyer was refueling ."
2149,"Today , FBI agents and divers were collecting evidence near the place they believe the boat was lowered into the water just before the attack on the `` USS Cole '' which killed 17 sailors and two suicide bombers ."
2150,Investigators have come up with a series of names of possible suspects found on papers in the houses and cars they searched .
2151,"In some cases , they have some names ."
2152,"They have not been able to verify whether they 're accurate , true names ."
2153,"In other cases , I do n't believe they have identities yet ."
2154,Yemeni sources say some of the bombers may have used ID cards issued by a government registration center 35 miles from Aden .
2155,"Today , at the walled - in headquarters of the government security agency , the manager of that center and several clerks who worked there were among dozens who have been detained and questioned ."
2156,"Investigators are aware that a few weeks before the bombing , accused terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden released a videotape calling for holy war against Americans in the Gulf ."
2157,"American investigators also say the way the bombers organized the plot in Aden has stark similarities to the way Bin Laden 's cells have operated in the past , but , they concede , while they are closer to learning the names of the bombers , they are still a long way from knowing or proving who sent them ."
2158,"John Miller , ABC News , Aden ."
2159,"We have an exclusive report tonight about the `` USS Cole , '' and an identical attack that was planned , but failed , several months earlier ."
2160,Here 's ABC 's John M Wethy .
2161,ABC News has learned that the terrorists who attacked the `` USS Cole '' originally planned to hit a different American warship in the same port ten months earlier .
2162,The attack was to be part of a worldwide effort during celebration of the millennium that included targets in Jordan and Seattle .
2163,"Intelligence sources say the target was to be a destroyer , the `` USS The Sullivans , '' which refueled in Yemen 's port of Aden in January ."
2164,"Sources tell ABC News that a suspect who has been in custody for several weeks told Yemeni investigators that his group failed in their attack because their small boat , overloaded with explosives , sank just off the beach ."
2165,The suspect said it took months to repackage and redesign the load of high explosives that was eventually used against `` the Cole . ''
2166,"John M Wethy , ABC News , the Pentagon ."
2167,Good evening .
2168,"That call to order you just heard reverberates through the Supreme Court every day that the justices convene , but today was no everyday session ."
2169,Never before has the United States Supreme Court taken up a case that could decide a presidential election .
2170,It did today .
2171,That session of the Supreme Court and two defeats for Al Gore in Florida courts dominate the news today .
2172,"We start with the U.S. Supreme Court , specifically at issue , an appeal from the campaign of George W. Bush that the Florida Supreme Court had exceeded its authority when it ruled Florida counties could have more time to hand - count ballots ."
2173,"Throughout an hour and a half of argument , the justices were aggressive in peppering lawyers with questions , and they seemed interested on two issues ."
2174,"Was there a federal issue involved that would even require the U.S. Supreme Court to rule ? and if so , did the Florida Supreme Court improperly rewrite Florida law , as Governor Bush contends ?"
2175,"A sure sign of the historic nature of the day 's proceeding , for the first time ever , the court immediately released an audiotape of the arguments ."
2176,"But in the courtroom , listening in person was ABC 's Jackie Judd ."
2177,"Even now , hours after that hearing ended , there are still protesters circling the Supreme Court ."
2178,"As boisterous as the protesters were , nothing intruded on the ritual inside ."
2179,The chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States .
2180,The courtroom was packed .
2181,"Al Gore 's top campaign aides , his children , Republican senators and congressmen , they were all there ."
2182,God save the United States and this honorable court .
2183,"First up , Ted Olson lawyer for George W. Bush , laying out the campaign 's main claim ."
2184,Olson made it through only 56 seconds of his arguments before a justice broke in .
2185,"Well , Mr. Olson --"
2186,"Sandra Day O'Connor , often the swing vote on this court , demanded to know why the court even had a role in this case ."
2187,"Olson argued that a century - old federal statute prevents laws governing an election from being created after the fact which , he claimed , is just what the Florida court did , and also , that the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures , not the courts , the right to choose electors ."
2188,Of all the justices it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg who seemed most sympathetic to the Florida Supreme Court .
2189,"Midway through the hearing , Chief Justice Rehnquist seemed to scold his colleagues for being too talkative when he made an unusual offer to the lawyer representing Florida 's Attorney General ."
2190,And so it went on .
2191,"Laurence Tribe , Gore 's attorney , said the state court did nothing illegal ."
2192,It simply provided a way for a close election to be examined .
2193,"Justice O'Connor again , but this time suggesting the state court had overstepped its authority and perhaps there was a federal case here ."
2194,Justice Antonin Scalia also pressed Tribe .
2195,"He said the state court relied on the Florida Constitution to draft its decision , excluding state lawmakers and that violated the U.S. Constitution ."
2196,It was Justice Breyer who asked the most straightforward question of all .
2197,What happens if the court rules in favor of Bush ?
2198,"The answer from the Secretary of State 's lawyer was , Bush wins and all the litigation in Florida ends ."
2199,Not everyone agrees .
2200,"They say that no matter which way the court rules , it will not provide nearly so much finality to this presidential election ."
2201,Charlie ?
2202,Jackie Judd at the Supreme Court .
2203,Our thanks .
2204,The `` USS Cole '' has arrived back at the Mississippi shipyard where she was built .
2205,"ABC 's John M. Wethy reports tonight before the attack on the ship , the crew failed to take at least 25 % of the 80 different steps to protect the ship before landing in Yemen ."
2206,An investigation is already under way .
2207,The ship 's captain is going to take a lot of heat for the 17 sailors who died .
2208,The ship will sail again .
2209,"After George W. Bush is sworn in , Bill Clinton will head to New York ."
2210,"The President has said he and his wife , now a New York senator will spend weekends at their house in Chappaqua ."
2211,Mr. Clinton will also spend time at his presidential library in Arkansas .
2212,"He says he will come to Washington , `` every now and then . ''"

2214,Here 's our story this half hour --
2215,There 's dancing in the streets of Belgrade as angry demonstrations have turned into celebrations .
2216,Tens of thousands of people crowded the streets of the Yugoslavian capital today after the apparent overthrow of President Slobodan Milosevic .
2217,"Yesterday , protesters stormed key government buildings and seized Serb state television in Belgrade ."
2218,Russia has joined the West in its support of opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica .
2219,Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov congratulated Kostunica on his election victory .
2220,He also gave him a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin .
2221,Putin says he hopes the opposition leader will do `` everything possible to overcome the internal political crisis '' in Yugoslavia .
2222,Russia was the last European power to withhold support for the opposition .
2223,The man who lost power in Yugoslavia finally surfaced today .
2224,Slobodan Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov .
2225,Ivanov says Milosevic told him he plans to remain in Serbia and continue to run its largest political party .
2226,"Indeed Milosevic still considers himself to be President , according to his brother Borislav ."
2227,"In an interview with CNN , Borislav Milosevic accused Western nations of supporting the demonstrations and said his brother has no plans to leave the city ."
2228,"Regardless of how many votes Mr. Kostunica received , the actions that took place last night are vandalism ."
2229,It 's violence .
2230,It should n't have happened .
2231,That 's not democracy .
2232,"The opposition did n't accept the ruling of the constitutional court and began to storm the parliament , which was not being defended , and inflicted huge material damage , but it also did more damage to our institutions ."
2233,The next step in the transition to a new government is for the Yugoslav parliament to convene .
2234,A commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to Belgrade for a special session .
2235,Alessio Vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of parliament will have to travel to Belgrade from Montenegro .

2237,"With the events of the past week in Yugoslavia , the world is getting to know the name of Vojislav Kostunica ."
2238,Jonathan Mann takes a look at the man and his politics .
2239,"Unlike President Milosevic , he was not a Communist in the long years when party membership was the key to power ."
2240,He was not among the prominent opposition figures who have struggled against each other almost as hard as the regime .
2241,"He is an orthodox Serb nationalist , but he supports truer democracy for his country and better relations with its neighbors and the West ."
2242,Kostunica is a soft - spoken and uncharismatic figure who spent years building the Democratic Party of Serbia and gathering only modest support .
2243,"After ten years , people know what are the differences between Milosevic 's policies and ours , what Milosevic was saying and promising and what the opposition parties and I myself was saying in these years and how I was behaving ."
2244,"Kostunica is 56 , an expert on constitutional law who lives with his wife and pets in a Belgrade apartment ."
2245,He was fired from his job teaching law in 1974 for his opposition to the policies of the Tito government .
2246,"He refused an offer to return in 1989 because of his opposition to the Milosevic regime , and he rejects much from the West as well -- the Dayton peace accord , Western sanctions on Yugoslavia , and the war crimes tribunal ."
2247,"In the months before the election , he was careful to distinguish between his support for European aid projects tied to reform and U.S. efforts , which he describes as unhelpful , even to the opposition ."
2248,"I know what the support means when we get from European Union , the programs like energy for democracy , school for democracy ."
2249,Those small projects .
2250,"Here we get nothing in advance , just a political support which consists of nothing , and which is mostly used and abused and manipulated by the regime , saying they are just NATO parties , as is often said by regime , they are not having their own policy ."
2251,"Jonathan Mann , CNN ."
2252,We 'll be following the events in Yugoslavia all day .

2463,"I just brought her little brother William in , and as William and she saw each other , it was such a wonderful reunion for them to just hug , and he would hug her and look at her and hug her and look at her , and could n't believe , I think , as a 4 - year - old now that his sister is home ."
2464,"With the darkness that surrounds us in these times of the possibility of war that could be coming upon us and a miracle that has been brought to us , an incredible miracle that has been brought to our family , words can not express how grateful we are for the prayers around the world ."

2478,We 're getting late word tonight that Geraldo Rivera may not be be kicked out of Iraq after all .
2479,Originally the Central Command said the veteran Fox News correspond was being expelled because he compromised the location of the unit he 's been embedded with .
2480,"Now a spokesman from the Central Command is saying and I 'm quoting `` Frankly , we have bigger and more important things to do . ''"
2481,During a live broadcast Geraldo drew a map in the sand showing the location of the unit in relation to Baghdad .
2482,"Says he 's not aware he 's being expelled but says if so , it is because some bitter former colleagues of his at MSNBC blew the whistle on him ."
2483,"It sounds to me like some rats at my former network , NBC , are spreading some lies about me ."
2484,"You know , they ca n't compete fair and square on the battlefield so they 're trying to stab me in the back ."
2485,It is not first time .
2486,The Central Command on the other hand says Rivera is being kicked out of Iraq because `` he gave away the big picture stuff . ''

2492,Today he appeared on NBC 's `` Today '' show and said he was sorry .
2493,I want to apologize to the American people for clearly making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving an interview to Iraqi television .
2494,"Now , I said in that interview essentially what we all know about the war , there have been delays in implementing policy , there has been surprises , but clearly by giving that interview to Iraqi television , I created a firestorm in the United States , and for that I am truly sorry ."
2495,"Arnett had been covering the war for National Geographic , which also fired him as TV reports were given exclusively to NBC and MSNBC ."
2496,Late word from London that the tabloid the Daily Mirror just hired Peter Arnett to be its correspondent in Baghdad .
2497,But the question remains Did Peter Arnett and Geraldo Rivera cross the line ? or were they within their rights as reporters ?

2511,"We also know that 12 miles southwest of the city , coalition forces remain largely in control of what was formerly Saddam Hussein International Airport , now renamed by the coalition Baghdad International Airport , but the coalition is quick to point out that they do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the airport ."
2512,"Again , these are live pictures of Baghdad , where it is well into the night ."
2513,"We 're , of course , going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn ."
2514,"Until southern Iraq , another symbol of Saddam Hussein 's regime is in ruins tonight ."

2627,"A better one might be , people do and people die and still other people search their souls and struggle for redemption ."
2628,The story from `` Newsnight 's '' Beth Nissen .
2629,Reporter :
2630,It was the lead story across Connecticut in early April .
2631,"Police say Jennifer O'Conner , a Connecticut woman with a history of psychiatric problems confessed to shooting her daughter 7 , while the 7 - year - old girl lay sleeping ."
2632,"O'Conner told police she could no longer cope with her daughter 's learning , disability Prps Sara Dade three days later ."
2633,"Thomas , owner a local gun and motorcycle shop , said he felt gutted when he saw the news reports of O'Conner 's arrest on murder charges ."
2634,"As soon as the police officers pulled the gun out and held it up , I knew it was my rifle ."
2635,Reporter :
2636,Had sold O'Conner the rifle a few months before .
2637,She explained to me she .
2638,"Ed a lighter , smaller caliber hunting gun for deer hunting , for medium - size game hunting ."
2639,Reporter :

2641,He sent O'Conner 's information to the state authorities for a background check .

2645,From Texas politics now to Chinese censorship .
2646,China today blacked out a CNN interview that was critical of the Chinese government 's handling of the SARs epidemic and of the country 's health care system .
2647,China requires foreign broadcasters to use a Chinese satellite to serve their country .
2648,"Until last month it was routinely blocking almost all reports about Sars in China , a practice that has produced intense global criticism ."
2649,The British Broadcasting Company has also faced the censorship in China .
2650,In 1993 Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling stake in China 's Star TV satellite system .
2651,In 1994 the BBC World Service broadcasts were pulled from Star .
2652,China was offended by the BBC 's news content and demanded that STAR TV remove it or lose permission to broadcast in China .
2653,A year later Murdoch bought the rest of Star TV that he did not own .
2654,"Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. has an extensive presence , of course in this country ."
2655,"That presence may be expanding soon , if the FCC eases some of its broadcast rules ."
2656,Murdoch has lobbied hard for those changes .
2657,They would allow him to buy even more U.S. television stations .
2658,Next month the FCC is likely to accommodate him .
2659,Murdoch today promised that if the rules are changed he will limit future purchases to a few of what he calls sizable markets .
2660,Let 's talk a little bit more about what the Navy does to prevent such tragedies .
2661,We were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .
2662,I 'll try to explain it the best I can from what I remember from being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln '' .
2663,"This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the Navy does with regard to prevention ."
2664,", every sailor that 's entering the Navy does take a swim test ."
2665,They learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .
2666,"Also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment ."
2667,"Usually twice a day , they 're practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly ."
2668,They also wear float coats .
2669,You can see them here .
2670,The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .
2671,Everything is color coordinated .
2672,You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate .
2673,They also have a manual device so if the toggles do n't work they can blow air into the inflation device .
2674,They have dive goggles and they 're able to find them .
2675,It also has a strobe light and a whistle .
2676,"Also such location devices , some ships have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to , let the rescuer locate them ."
2677,"Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout the ship , all around the ship , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of the ship , not all around the entire ship , but on most parts there is a very thick netting ."
2678,Now let 's talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .
2679,"You will hear a P.A. announcement around the entire ship , there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly ."
2680,"A ship - wide search will happen if they do n't see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously ."
2681,"Also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately ."
2682,Inside those helicopters rescue swimmers .
2683,"If indeed the man overboard is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness ."
2684,"If the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours ."
2685,The search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search .
2686,Why call it off ?
2687,There 's a number of reasons to look at .
2688,"Depending on the water temperature , it 's very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time ."
2689,Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they 've exhausted all resources by that time .
2690,"Anyway , we 'll continue to follow what 's happening on the `` USS Nassau '' as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors ."
2691,"Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas scheduled to meet today , their second chance now to discuss the Bush administration 's road map for Mideast peace ."

2697,The 31 - year - old mother of three was convicted in March of having sex outside of marriage .
2698,Three other Nigerians also face stoning deaths for the same crime .
2699,The prosecution of premarital or extramarital sex is not quite as rare as you might think .
2700,Our next guest this morning faced 100 lashes for premarital sex in Pakistan .
2701,She was there as a journalist in the wake of the 9 / 11 attacks .
2702,She has written about her experience in the book `` Tantrika '' Traveling the Road of Divine Love .
2703,A traveling reporter now on leave and joins us to tell her story .
2704,Thank you for coming in to share this with us .
2705,"As I understand it , you say you were facing a sentence of 100 lashes , had not yet been sentenced that ?"
2706,"Back in this city , a courthouse in Manhattan ."
2707,"Sam Waksal , founder and former CEO of ImClone is scheduled to be sentenced today ."

2709,"Waksal could be fined $ 3.5 million , facing a maximum of 75 years in prison , expected , though , to receive about six to seven years ."
2710,That 's the early indication we 've been given .
2711,"A friend of his , Martha Stewart , pleaded not guilty last week ."
2712,The charges related to her sale of ImClone stock .
2713,"She sold the share a day before bad news about the company sent the stock price falling , considerably ."

2783,"With a look at how the candidates are getting out the vote there , here 's NBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders ."
2784,"The image of Florida , both fact and fiction ."
2785,"A great getaway , a state where a mouse wields more power than a tropical paradise ."
2786,"While the mild winters make this comfortable living for almost three million seniors , the largest elderly population in the United States , this year it is not the weather drawing Al Gore and George W. Bush to the Sunshine State ."
2787,"Both candidates list 25 reasons to keep coming back , Florida 's 25 electoral votes ."
2788,Polls show Florida is still up for grabs .
2789,Both candidates have been here almost equally .
2790,"In fact , it 's almost I dare you politics ."
2791,"Each of them dares the other one to spend less time , money , and energy than they are at their own peril ."
2792,"Elderly voters once again in Florida , the most important voting bloc because they actually vote more than any other group ."
2793,"In this election , 45 % of those going to the voting booth are expected to be over the age of 65 ."
2794,"The issue most important to them , Social Security ."
2795,"Pay down the nation 's debt , strengthen Social Security , cut taxes for middle class family , save our environment ."
2796,Experience .
2797,Vision .
2798,Values .
2799,Al Gore .
2800,Why does Al Gore say one thing when the truth is another ?
2801,"His attacks on George Bush 's Social Security plan , exaggerations ."
2802,"The truth , nonpartisan analysis confirms George Bush 's plan sets aside $ 2.4 trillion to strengthen Social Security ."
2803,"Both candidates repeatedly talking about that one issue , but in Florida where there are more than 550 children born every day , families drive the other campaign issues ."
2804,"Polls show education , the environment , and the candidate 's character will influence who voters choose ."
2805,"And in this diverse state with a 15 % Hispanic population , both candidates courting their votes in ways not seen in any previous election ."
2806,"Following both conventions , Gore and Bush granted their first live TV interviews to this man ."
2807,"His name , Jorge Ramos , the Tom Brokaw of Spanish language news ."
2808,"The race gets really , really close , and let 's suppose that states like Florida and Illinois might decide the election ."
2809,"maybe , maybe Hispanic votes might decide , too , who would be the next President of the United States ."
2810,"The largest Hispanic voting bloc of Florida , Republican voters who do not seem to be crossing the party line ."
2811,"Gore wanted the young Cuban boy , Elian Gonzalez to stay in this country ."
2812,Joe Lieberman brings Gore support he probably would have gotten here anyway .
2813,Sizable Jewish and African - American voting blocs .
2814,"Of the 10 largest states , Florida is the most Republican ."
2815,"The Republican governor here , Jeb Bush was once expected to deliver his brother this state ."
2816,"The managers of both campaigns saying in the end , the wipper may simply be determined by who gets more people to the voting booth ."
2817,"Kerry Sanders , NBC News , Anaheim ."
2818,"There was , of course , a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over the weekend of this trial going on in the courtroom in Florida , and , of course , among the teams of lawyers on the Bush side , one of the leaders , Ben Ginsberg , one of the lawyers who argued the case in Leon County Circuit Court ."
2819,"He 's with us tonight , victorious in Tallahassee , Florida , and Ben , whatever the outcome today , and you were on the upside , you are forced now to go along with the appeals process as is the right of the Gore team ."
2820,What is your reaction to the work that will cause ?
2821,"Well , I mean , we 're certainly prepared to brief all the issues ."
2822,"I think that the circuit court judge , Judge Sauls gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of Florida law ."
2823,"Well , let 's talk about your statement earlier today that the Vice President -- I guess you were asked should the Vice President concede , and you answered , the Vice President should do what 's best for the United States ."
2824,Is that what you 're trying to say ?
2825,"Well , sure ."
2826,"I mean , I think that all the people involved in this unique situation , the first time a presidential election in our history has been contested , Brian , need to do the right thing , and I 'm sure do the right thing , as they see fit ."
2827,"Do you think the judge there , in addition to just giving out his ruling at the end of the court session today , he went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why he turned down the Gore case ."
2828,Do you think his method there was to try to make this more or less appeal proof ?
2829,"Well , I think what he did was addressed the situation as it exists in Florida and addressed the contingencies that were raised in the voluminous briefs that he had , not only from the two party candidates involved , but also of the interveners who were in the case ."
2830,"As you know , the Democratic line throughout is they wo n't be happy until every vote is counted , and we could n't help but notice , should we call it a rhetorical device you used when talking to reporters this afternoon ."
2831,Pause and listen along with us to the following piece of videotape .
2832,Those ballots have been counted not once on election night but twice in the recount and how many did you say there were ?
2833,"10,750 --"
2834,"If you know the exact number , does n't that mean they 've been counted ?"
2835,So I do n't suppose that was any accident on your part ?
2836,"Well , they have been making this point throughout these proceedings that these ballots have never been counted , and that is factually not true ."
2837,"They have been counted on election night -- they 've been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not the case that those ballots have failed to be counted by anyone ."
2838,"Ben , for better or worse , you are forced now to follow the Gore team as they take you on a kind of trail of appeal here ."
2839,"If you were asked to predict whether this stops at the Florida or U.S. Supreme Court , what would your prediction be ?"
2840,"I think it 's one of those situations where I would have predicted all , Brian ."
2841,I think that the decisions are not ours to make .
2842,"We 'll be involved in all the legal processes obviously as long as the Gore campaign keeps them up , no matter how long that takes ."
2843,"Ben Ginsberg , attorney for the Bush team , victorious today in Tallahassee ."
2844,"Thank you very much , after a long day , for being with us tonight ."
2845,"Thanks , Brian ."
2846,"In the waters off the coast of Yemen , two urgent missions tonight collecting evidence from the suicide bombing and retrieving bodies still buried in debris ."
2847,316 were aboard the `` USS Cole '' when the terrorists struck .
2848,Dozens were injured .
2849,17 were killed .
2850,Our coverage begins with NBC 's Joe Johns .
2851,"A plane carrying the bodies of five dead American sailors from the `` USS Cole '' arrived today at Dover Air Force Base , as the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the Department of Defense and the FBI arrived in Yemen ."
2852,Their mission -- to continue the search for evidence and suspects in the explosion .
2853,"Also on the way , equipment to lift the `` Cole '' out of the water and specialists to help retrieve the bodies of those trapped and presumed dead ."
2854,We know there are spaces that are inaccessible .
2855,We know there are some remains in those spaces .
2856,We need to get in those and locate the remains that we anticipate finding there .
2857,"Though the work was only beginning , a top Justice Department official in Washington predicted the outcome of the investigation ."
2858,"I 'm confident that we will be able to determine who was behind the bombing and that those people , those organizations , will be held accountable , they will be punished ."
2859,This critical phase of the investigation must be conducted both above and beneath the water on a tight time line .
2860,They 'll want to get in there quickly because one of the problems when you 're dealing with seawater is that it will have an adverse effect on your evidence .
2861,"To further speed up the process , the FBI has now activated the Strategic Information and Operation Center in Washington , conceived after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers ."
2862,"On the diplomatic front , the U.S. said the government of Yemen is cooperating with the investigation , though that country 's President disputes charges that his nation is a haven for terrorists ."
2863,"The Justice Department says no group or individual has been ruled out as a suspect , though many expect that whoever gets the blame will eventually be tied to the terrorist Osama bin Laden ."
2864,And the grieving continued today at the Naval Academy 's football game against Notre Dame .
2865,A moment of silence to remember the victims of this terrorist act .
2866,"Joe Johns , NBC News ."
2867,"The `` USS Cole '' is on its long journey home tonight , sitting atop a rescue ship , and now , for the first time , its open wound fully visible ."
2868,NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski tonight at the Pentagon with an exclusive report on the damage done and the difficulty in finding those responsible .
2869,Jim ?
2870,What 's the latest there ?
2871,New pictures reveal the sheer power of that terrorist bomb that ripped through the `` USS Cole . ''
2872,"For the first time , with the `` Cole '' out of the water , the full impact of the catastrophic blast clearly visible ."
2873,"In these photos obtained by NBC News , the damage much larger than first imagined , extending well below the water line ."
2874,Workers on deck dwarfed by the 40 x 60 - foot gaping wound .
2875,Large sections of the hull buckled inward .
2876,"Crewman Sean Powell , back home in Florida , says inside the `` Cole , '' it was chaos , it got dark , we lost power , ship started to list , that 's what scared everybody ."
2877,"Despite the devastating damage , Navy officials predict the `` Cole '' can be repaired for about $ 150 million , and put back into service ."
2878,"Justice Department officials say in Yemen , the FBI 's investigation is dead in the water ."
2879,Senior U.S. officials tell NBC News the Yemen government has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind the `` Cole '' attack .
2880,Evidence is either withheld or tampered with .
2881,"A surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the attack was so heavily edited , it did n't even show the blast itself ."
2882,Why ?
2883,"Yemen is a terrorist hotbed , and some members of President Saleh 's own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists ."
2884,It 's hard to see exactly why it is that the President there would ever want to cooperate with the United States and possibly put himself in jeopardy .
2885,Reporter :
2886,"And even though cooperation from Yemen is at a standstill , U.S. officials tell NBC News that they are making substantial progress in the investigation and are fully confident they will get enough evidence to retaliate against those responsible ."
2887,Tom ?
2888,"Thanks very much , NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski tonight ."
2889,The nation 's highest court will take up the case next week .
2890,That development may not be as significant as it seems .
2891,"Joining me now is law professor Rick Pildes , a consultant to NBC News ."
2892,Could a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court settle this case once and for all ?
2893,"At this stage , any decision from the U.S. Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to provide a final resolution of this election dispute ."
2894,"Indeed , the issue is so narrow now before the Supreme Court that whichever way the court rules , it will likely have only the most marginal impact on what 's going on in Florida ."
2895,"Even if the Bush campaign prevails before the Supreme Court , it simply means we will move more quickly into the contest phase of the litigation or the next stage of the litigation ."
2896,But you believe the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court just decided to hear this case is a partial victory for both Bush and Gore .
2897,It is a partial victory for both sides .
2898,"For the last two weeks , the central constitutional argument the Bush campaign has been making to the federal courts is , stop these manual recounts now , they violate the Constitution ."
2899,"The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear that part of the case , agreeing with all the other federal judges who have unanimously held that this is not the proper time for federal court intervention ."
2900,"So in that sense , a victory for the Gore campaign ."
2901,"For the Bush campaign , a victory in the willingness of the Supreme Court to play some role in overseeing the Florida system and the Florida judicial decision making process ."
2902,"Whatever the Supreme Court decides this time , you say this case could come back before the U.S. Supreme Court again ?"
2903,"John , if the Supreme Court of the United States is to play a final and decisive role in this dispute , that role is going to come at the end of the Florida judicial process , not at this stage ."
2904,"Law professor Rick Pildes , thank you ."
2905,The Somali Islamic Courts announced that Ethiopia had invaded the country and called on all Somalis to expel them .
2906,"The Courts also said that its fighters killed 203 Ethiopians , and wounded twice this number , ."
2907,Lines are intertwined in Somalia with the escalation of events that raise many questions .
2908,"Has that country reached the brink of an all - out war that may drag into it , in one way or another , most of the Horn of Africa states ?"
2909,"And , is it possible to resume the Khartoum negotiations in light of the continued present complication of issues ?"
2910,The answer so far appears unclear .
2911,"The fighters of the Islamic Courts announced their control of the city of Ibla south of Baidoa , the headquarters of the transitional government , after killing dozens of Ethiopian soldiers in that city ."
2912,"They warned about the likelihood of opening new fighting fronts in the town of Jaree , where they say Ethiopian troops have entered ."
2913,"<foreign lang=""unknown""> </foreign>"
2914,We want the entire world to know that Ethiopia has invaded Somalia and the war now is with the Ethiopian government .
2915,All the people of Somalia are urged to repel this invasion .
2916,"So far we have defeated the enemies , but I call on all the people to rise up to expel the enemy out of the country ."
2917,"The Somali transitional government has acknowledged the violent fighting taking place in the south of the country ,"
2918,but it has described it as occurring between the forces of the government and the fighters of the Islamic Courts that reject the country 's legitimate authority .
2919,It has denied any connection with the Ethiopians or others in the matter .
2920,"Parliament has approved dispatching forces to help us train , uh , the national forces ."
2921,"So the Ethiopian forces are from these , are among these forces ."
2922,"And in such deteriorating conditions in which all sides exchange blame , dense fog seems to surround the outcome of the mission undertaken over the last few days by Louis Michel , the European Union Aid Commissioner ."
2923,"Michel had announced that the parties to the conflict have agreed to stop fighting , but this has not yet happened ."
2924,He also announced the agreement by the concerned parties to resume the Khartoum negotiations .
2925,"And it appears that the only remaining glimmer of hope to extinguish the fuse is for the parties to go to Khartoum without conditions , despite the difficulties entailed with accomplishing this ."
2926,"Lebanon , Iraq and other hot issues were for the most part the gist of the call with which the Gulf leaders concluded their 27th summit in Riyadh ."
2927,"Yes , Dalila , the concluding statement of the Riyadh summit warned against the partition of Iraq and demanded that parties it left unnamed not interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq ."
2928,"Certainly , the summit did not conclude this session without an overview of progress on the customs union and the steps for establishing the Gulf Common Market ."
2929,Faiza Allaj .
2930,"The session was in the Gulf , but the flavor that characterized the atmosphere of the Cooperation Council summit was a blend of the crisis issues of the region , each according to its degree of urgency ."
2931,"But Iraq , with its worsening situation , won a large share of the concluding statement of the Jaber Summit ."
2932,"The security and stability of Iraq can only be achieved with the cooperation of all its people , regardless of their denominational , ethnic or religious affiliations , as well as their joint efforts to give precedence to the interests of Iraq over all considerations , preserve the unity of its people and its territory , and reject the calls for division and partition ."
2933,"Iran , which was implicitly reminded not to interfere in the affairs of Iraq , was explicitly mentioned with the expression of Gulf concerns for its possession of nuclear programs ."
2934,"And on the rest of the Arab crises , and in particular Lebanon , the Gulf leaders called on all parties to adhere to the constitutional and legitimate institutions of that country and condemned the return to acts of violence and political assassinations ."
2935,"Concerning Palestine , a call was issued to speed up the formation of a national unity government and reject political conflicts between the two movements , Fatah and Hamas ."
2936,The concluding statement of the Jaber Summit reviewed in detail the progress made on the customs union and the steps for the establishment of the Gulf Common Market .
2937,It approved allowing the citizens of the Council to exercise a number of economic activities .
2938,"Those are the steps that are expected to complete the process of economic integration , which is what all the peoples of the Gulf want ."
2939,"Iran today held elections for the Leadership Experts Council , in addition to municipal councils and complementary elections for the Islamic Consultative Assembly ."
2940,Numerous lists are competing in these elections .
2941,Competition was greater for the municipal councils which are close to the lives of citizens and the services these councils provide to solve these citizens ' problems such as unemployment and inflation .
2942,The Leadership Experts Council bears responsibility for supervising the work of the supreme leader or guide of the political regime in addition to elections if there is n't one .
2943,Candidates for the Leadership Experts Council are required to be highly knowledgeable in Islamic religious sciences whereas candidates to municipal councils do not have to be .
2944,"The conservatives were divided into three lists in the municipal elections . While the reformists lined up in one list in the hope of winning these elections which are considered an indicator for upcoming elections , whether presidential or Consultative Assembly elections ."
2945,"Of the three conservative lists , the first backed Iranian President Ahmedinejad . While the second backed Tehran 's mayor and the former presidential candidate , Mohammed Baqer Qalibaf ."
2946,"The Chairman of the Consultative Assembly , Haddad Adel , backed the third list called the Reformist Conservatives ."
2947,"While the conservatives monopolized the Leadership Experts Councils , competition for the municipal councils was abundant ."
2948,Results for these council elections indicate the acceptability of the presidency of President Ahmedinejad .
2949,They also have an effect on the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections .
2950,"From a voting center , Mohammed Salih Sadqi , Kuwait State Television , Tehran ."
2951,"The talks which the Secretary General of the Arab League Amr Moussa is holding in Lebanon for the second consecutive day , to find a way out of the current political crisis , have made progress according to what Moussa himself announced this afternoon from the offices of the Prime Minister , after he met Prime Minister Fuad Siniora , in the presence of the Sudanese President 's envoy Mustafa Osman Ismail ."
2952,"We are now in the course of communicating , consulting , tracking and -- agreeing on many issues relating to the situation here ."
2953,"By God we have reached , ah , I mean , to a mood , ah , much better in -- and we are talking with different parties ."
2954,"It is not possible to achieve progress unless we reach with all parties , to , ah , a basis which all agree on , which has benefit and might have concession ."
2955,"The important thing is that the basis and objective is the most famous Lebanese principle : no winner , no loser ."
2956,"Moussa and Ismail 's round of talks included since this morning the Maronite leader Patriarch Sfeir , who supported the Arab initiative ."
2957,It also included MP Michel Aoun who is one of the pillars of the opposition .
2958,Moussa said that the latter showed great understanding towards ending the climate of tension and reaching an agreement on all different frameworks which protect Lebanon .
2959,"There are issues that require now , ah -considering they are the main issues -- that we solve them , and there are other issues whose time and context will come , ah , this is not the context ."
2960,"Moussa and his accompanying delegation also had consultations with former Lebanese President Amin Gemayel , who pointed out the economic , social and lifestyle results from all that is happening today , which are negative as a whole , if the situation is not rectified and work is not done to find appropriate solutions ."
2961,"Moussa met also the head of the Democratic Gathering , MP Walid Jumblatt , the prominent personality in the parliamentary and government majority ."
2962,Moussa announced that his consultations will be repeated as well with the head of the government and the speaker of parliament before meeting President of the Republic Emile Lahoud tomorrow .
2963,"In the wake of the application for world natural and cultural heritage status for the Five Great Mountains , seven of our country 's biggest Danxia landform regions , including Guangdong 's Mt. Danxia and Hunan 's Mt. Lang , today once again jointly applied in bundle to the World Heritage Committee for world natural heritage status ."
2964,Danxia Landforms is the collective name for red sandrock that through long - term wind erosion has taken various and wonderful Danxia peaks .
2965,"The scenic areas participating in the joint application include Mt. Danxia in Guangdong , Mt. Lang in Hunan , Mt. Wanfo , Ziyuan County in Guangzi , Lake Dajin in Fujian , Mt. Longhu in Jiangxi and Fang Cliff in Zhejiang ."
2966,"According to the joint application proposal , the collective name for the application to the World Heritage Committee is China 's Danxia Landforms ."
2967,The official document submitted was jointly compiled by the seven Danxia landform regions .
2968,The cost involved in the application was also shouldered jointly by the seven applicants .
2969,"At the beginning of 2008 , the World Heritage Committee will conduct a comprehensive survey and assessment of scenic areas of heritage site applicants ."
2970,"Eh , a current trend is that UNESCO , ah , and the World Heritage Center encourage each member country , uh , to make more joint or linked applications ."
2971,"Because , uh , they also feel , uh , presently , uh , that sometimes single entities may result in too great of a number , so they hope that , eh , similar proposals like this can be joined together as much as possible ."
2972,"In this way , eh , they can be , eh , made more representative ."
2973,The recently concluded China - Africa Forum reminded many people of the Tanzania - Zambia Railway which China offered support in building in Africa .
2974,"However , people may not know that today another group of Chinese people in a foreign land are still evoking the same kind of touching story , treating the war wounds of battle - scarred Cambodia , and paving a road to prosperity ."
2975,"The restoration project for Highway 7 from Kracheh , Cambodia , to the Cambodia - Laos border is China 's largest project aiding Cambodia to date ."
2976,It is being undertaken by China 's Shanghai Construction Group .
2977,"Previously on this 186 - kilometer road , the widest section was only four meters , while the narrowest was only 40 centimeters ."
2978,"The road was bumpy and rough throughout , and there were landmines left from the chaos of war back then ."
2979,"Since construction started on November 18 , 2004 , through the hard work of Chinese engineers , the width of all road sections has now been broadened to over seven meters ."
2980,"The first layer of asphalt has been laid and pressed on most road sections , with all lanes expected to be open to traffic by July 2007 ."
2981,"In order to turn this small path into a thoroughfare , the Chinese engineering personnel have overcome a series of difficulties ."
2982,Let us look at this picture first .
2983,"This picture , ah , was published on the front cover of Nature Magazine printed on the 14th ."
2984,"The animals in this picture , uh , perhaps you may not be very familiar with ."
2985,"It 's called Volaticotherium antiquus , Gu as in Gudai , and Xiang as in Fei Xiang ."
2986,It was discovered by five Chinese scientists regularly stationed in both China and the United States during an archaeological expedition at the end of last year .
2987,"Of course , this picture , uh , was also drawn based on the recovered portrait of the fossil ."
2988,The World Journal said that the meaning of the discovery of Volaticotherium antiquus is of great significance .
2989,"By now , the earliest known mammal gliders are bats , which had started to exist about 51 million years ago ."
2990,"But Volaticotherium antiquus , uh , may have lived between 130 million to 160 million years ago , during the same time period as the dinosaurs ."
2991,"Its discovery , ah , pushed the origins of mammal gliders back at least 80 million years ."
2992,"A regiment of artillery corps from Guangzhou military region combined the characteristics of new equipment , and actively explored new ways to protect new equipment in an information battlefield environment , so as to improve the equipment and safeguard personnel , as well as to ensure their protection and combat abilities ."
2993,"What you are seeing now is a regiment of artillery corps conducting its new equipment protective exercise in a simulated battlefield background ; through such exercises , eh , they are able to examine the protection capability of their troops ' equipment and safeguard personnel during times of war ."
2994,"At the site of the military exercise , the reporter saw that when the front artillery equipment experienced problems , the basic support group of the regiment deployed along the rim quickly dispatched an artillery repair team , which then headed to the rocket artillery group and helped repair the damaged weaponry ."
2995,"In order to enhance the support capacity of the new equipment , this regiment embarks on the requirement of an actual combat , enhancing trainings such as battlefield repair , equipment maintenance and repair under joint long - distance firepower , and other contents ."
2996,"Altering from the previous sentinel - based protection mode , troops were sent to the field to conduct a completely new safeguard training in a mobile operation field , so as to train safeguard personnel in a simulated war environment and enhance their safeguard capabilities ."
2997,"A regiment of the Second Artillery Corps , which has just passed the general staff 's operational capability assessment , conducted a new round of training impetus regarding their exposed weak links during the examination ."
2998,"George is an eight - year - old boy who lives in Tbilisi , the capital of Georgia ."
2999,"On the day of November 23 , his supporters gathered in the city ."
3000,This day he tried to push a truck with his bare hands at the age of eight to break a Guinness World Record .
3001,George looks somewhat older than his real age .
3002,The simple reason is that his physique appears stronger than other children of the same age .
3003,"At eight years old , he already weighs 93 kilograms and is 150 centimeters tall ."
3004,Little George 's parents and relatives encourage him to take advantage of the gifts which he naturally possesses to make himself a famous person .
3005,He easily challenged the 43 - meter distance and broke the Guinness World Record .
3006,This achievement made his father very happy .
3007,"He said , I 'm very happy that my child has broken the Guinness World Record ."
3008,I 'm overjoyed .
3009,Today is St. George 's Day .
3010,My son George broke the Guinness world record on this day .
3011,St. George is a faction from the Eastern Orthodox Church .
3012,The Guinness World Record committee were looking for a volunteer to sign up to participate in the 500 kilograms challenge at first .
3013,George prepared to break the record under his father 's guidance .
3014,"When he had gotten everything ready , the truck had already been loaded to 2,100 kilograms ."
3015,This was enough to break the record .
3016,"The doctor who had been looking after George since he was small until he grew up said that although his body size was bigger and he was stronger than normal , overall he was very healthy ."
3017,"Last year and this year , the U. N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention twice reached unanimity regarding the issue of Saddam 's trial ."
3018,The conclusion was that the forcible deprivation of Saddam 's liberty contravened the provisions of Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
3019,The covenant is a binding international treaty of which both the US and Iraq are signatory states .
3020,The statements said that the opinion issued by the working group on September 1 of this year concretely set out many procedural shortcomings in Saddam 's trial .
3021,"These included the lack of independence and impartiality of the tribunal , the insufficient time and facilities Saddam had to prepare his defense , the restrictions on his right to access lawyers , also the restrictions on the possibilitly of defense lawyers in calling and interrogating witnesses , and so on ."
3022,"This working group also emphasized that in issuing the statement it was not requesting the release of Saddam , but rather was recommending that Iraq and US , in accordance with the relevant international covenants , reexamine whether at the outset Saddam 's trial conformed to regulations ."
3023,"Besides the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , these covenants also include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ."
3024,The working group also called on the Iraqi government to refrain from carrying out the sentence of death by hanging on Saddam until it had reexamined the trial procedures .
3025,Saddam is accused of carrying out a reprisal operation against local villagers and killing 143 people in the local area in 1982 after escaping an assassination in the village of Dujail .
3026,"On the 5th of this month , he was sentenced to death by hanging by the Iraqi High Tribunal ."
3027,"Even though Saddam still has the right to appeal to the appellate court , once the sentence has been determined it must be carried out within thirty days ."
3028,"From BBC News in London , I am James Cawling for The World ."
3029,The Yugoslav Army has given its support to President - elect Vojislav Kostunica .
3030,Earlier he had an hour long meeting with former President Slobodan Milosevic .
3031,It 's the first meeting since Milosevic was ousted by a popular revolt .
3032,He conceded defeat and congratulated his successor .
3033,"Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says , the lifting of international sanctions against Serbia can now be discussed ."
3034,"Our sanctions regime is not against the people of Serbia , it was against Milosevic , and if Milosevic is gone then there are many ways that the sanctions regime can be changed and lifted and adjusted ."
3035,Albright says Milosevic must not be allowed to maintain any position of power .
3036,Earlier Russia also recognized Kostunica as Yugoslavia 's new leader .
3037,Visiting Foreign Minister Evan Holf told Milosevic his time is up .
3038,This is The World .
3039,I am Tony Kahn .
3040,Novelist and playwright Gao Xingjian today became the first Chinese language author to win the Nobel Prize for Literature .
3041,Gao Xingjian 's avant - garde plays made him persona non-grata in his native China and he fled the country in 1988 .
3042,He settled in France becoming a French citizen two years ago .
3043,Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons in France .
3044,"Professor Lee , I gather you know the man and know his work ."
3045,"Tell us a little bit about him , Who is he and why did he flee China ."
3046,Gao Xingjian is quite an interesting writer because in some senses he differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in the West today .
3047,I would say that the great difference about Gao Xingjian is that he actually received a university education .
3048,"He was educated in French , so has a very good knowledge of French literature and it is very much French literature that has influenced his own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse him of blind worship of Western models ."
3049,"Sartre is a big man in Mr. Xingjian 's life , is n't he ?"
3050,I would say so that Sartre has been a quite a big influence .
3051,"I think the other influences would be Samuel Beckett , the Irish and French language writer , Unesco ."
3052,"These are models and , of course , all of these writers are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century ."
3053,"Well , this is very interesting because Mr. Gao left China before Tianenmen ."
3054,"He wrote a play , in particular about the events there ."
3055,Would you say that his influences may be more French literary then they were his own immediate life experience ?
3056,"I would say both , in fact , because the first play that he wrote that made him famous was a play that dates from 1981 , which was actually called ` Bus Stop ' , which many people said or had resonances from Beckett 's play ` Waiting for Godot ' and it concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came ."
3057,"So , we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of Beckett , but Gao Xingjian really before 1989 felt , that he was unable to write and to have his plays produced , as he would wish , and so left China couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989 ."
3058,I think it is a great day for modern Chinese literature and it is a day that has been awaited for the past 60 to 70 years .
3059,"Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons , France ."
3060,He spoke to us from his home in Provence .
3061,"Professor , thank you very much for speaking with us ."
3062,Not at all .
3063,Thank you very much .
3064,"This is the World , I am Lisa Mullins ."
3065,There are mounting allegations of police and military brutality in Zimbabwe .
3066,But President Robert Mugabe has deployed troops to quell rioting over the rising price of food .
3067,There are sharp increases here just as Zimbabwe has slumped into its worst economic crisis since becoming independent in 1980 .
3068,"In three days of unrest Army helicopters have dropped teargas in poor suburbs of the capital Harare , but many of those protesting say they wo n't stop until Mugabe , the man they blame for the country 's economic problems , surrenders the presidency ."
3069,From Harare the BBC 's Grant Ferrett reports .
3070,Protestors in one of Harare 's poor southern townships run for cover as riot police fire teargas from the top of an armored vehicle .
3071,Such confrontations have been taking place all over the south of the capital for several days .
3072,"The aim is twofold , to demand a halt to the rising prices of basics such as food , fuel and transport , as well as the resignation of President Mugabe ."
3073,People are demonstrating for the price increase fuel and everything .
3074,They are trying to stay away .
3075,They do n't want to go to work .
3076,They want to stay away .
3077,"So what happened here , can you tell me ?"
3078,"We set a barricade , not for our people but for the police ."
3079,We do n't want them .
3080,We want them to go .
3081,And what have the police done ?
3082,"They are rounding up people to clear our barricade , forcing them , beating them , throwing teargas canisters into school children , but the war here has just started ."
3083,"Nearly four months after Zimbabwe 's bloodiest parliamentary elections , the economy has gone from bad to worse ."
3084,"President Mugabe 's vitriolic attacks on the west combined with continuing lawlessness , particularly on white owned commercial farms have driven away donors , investors and tourists ."
3085,Zimbabwe now has Africa 's fastest shrinking economy .
3086,Many of us like to characterize Zimbabwe 's crisis as an economic crisis but it is wider and deeper than economy .
3087,Simba Makoni looks and sounds like an opposition politician .
3088,"In fact , he is the recently appointed finance minister ."
3089,"You can see the price of bread go up , you can see your bus fares go up , you can see companies closing down or working short weeks and that sort of thing , but you can also read Zimbabwe 's crisis in the number of destitute people on the streets , in the number of crimes being committed ."
3090,245 !
3091,245 !
3092,Zimbabwe earns the bulk of its hard currency here on the tobacco auction floors .
3093,This year 's crop is down because of the continuing occupation of white owned farms .
3094,"When the selling season ends next month , foreign exchange reserves , hardly estimated to cover just a few days of imports , are likely to completely dry up ."
3095,"Without them , paying for central imports such as fuel and electricity will become even more difficult ."
3096,"What we have right now is a political crisis and until that political crisis is resolved , there is no way the economy is going to improve ."
3097,The sentiments of economist Howard Setoli are widely shared .
3098,"With eighteen months to go until scheduled presidential elections , Zimbabwe is headed for complete economic ruin ."
3099,"If government continues on its current path , the economy will continue to contract ."
3100,This year it was expected to contract by 8 % .
3101,Next year we see a further contraction of 12 % .
3102,"So we are talking of massive unemployment , severe foreign exchange shortage ."
3103,It is an alarming prediction .
3104,"For those taking part in the protests on the streets , after two decades in office they want President Mugabe to go now ."
3105,We want a new President .
3106,The situation is like Yugoslavia now .
3107,We do n't want Mugabe .
3108,No more .

3111,Clashes between Israeli Army units and Palestinians have continued into the night .
3112,That 's after another day of violence in which four Palestinians were killed .
3113,Helicopter gunships were deployed around the West Bank village of Bagella .
3114,"Exchanges of fire between Israelis and Palestinians have also been reported around Jericho , Greg Barrow reports ."
3115,A day of violence across the West Bank and Gaza has been followed by more clashes after nightfall .
3116,Houses in the West Bank village of Bagella have been attached by Israeli helicopter gunships .
3117,"An Israeli military spokesman said they were deployed in response to gun fire from Palestinians inside Bagella , which was aimed at the Jewish settlement of Kilo ."
3118,"The Israelis say the helicopters went into action firing machine guns , but unconfirmed reports from inside Bagella suggested rockets may have been used ."
3119,"Greg Barrow , BBC News , Jerusalem ."
3120,This is the World I am Lisa Mullins .
3121,"Well we ca n't tell you who won Florida , but in a moment we will enter the musical question , who let the dogs out ?"
3122,First up we have the answer to our geo quiz today .
3123,We are looking for a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea .
3124,"The area is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno , the highest peak of the Apennines ."
3125,"It also includes a lot of sheep , good clean - living , healthy sheep , and an Italian entrepreneur has an idea about how to make a little money of them ."
3126,The answer is Abruzzo .
3127,"Journalist Carlos Depalazai was in Rome , Italy and Carlo how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of the Abruzzo ?"
3128,"He is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in the Italy at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food ."
3129,So this guy came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet .
3130,So you can have access through your computer on your desk .
3131,Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted .
3132,"So what does it mean to adopt a sheep , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of its progress on the farm in Italy ?"
3133,You are not actually adopting the sheep in the sense that you can have it with you .
3134,"It looks like distant adoption , where you do n't actually have the child in your home ."
3135,You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .
3136,"It works in the same way , so you have access on the web site of this little farm , in a little village of Abrutzi and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of money the sheep is actually yours ."
3137,"All right , so the amount of money you have mentioned to us is about 160 US dollars and for that you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling ."
3138,You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of the sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door .
3139,"Yeah , I mean this is quite funny , but apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange I think what is really important is that it is a sign of a new concern that is effecting Italian people ."
3140,I mean we are notoriously lover of good food .
3141,"We have a generous attitude towards food , and this is a new stuff ."
3142,"The fact that you really care about a sheep in the way she is fed , in the way she is nurtured , in the way people are looking after it , because it 's a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on your table up the end ."
3143,"Wait a minute , you said that on your table at the end ."
3144,"Yeah , at the table if it becomes food for instance , which is an option ."
3145,You are adopting the sheep and whatever happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .
3146,That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing .
3147,I mean usually when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving an animal not eventually eating it .
3148,I mean this is an option which is available and I think it is a sort of provocation .
3149,"You know Italians now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like Rome , Florence , Naples ."
3150,"In the past , we were a population of shepherds or farmers ."
3151,We had completely different attitude towards nature .
3152,"It seems that we are losing something , and we need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that the Environment Minister in Italy supported the initiative and he himself adopted a sheep is significant ."
3153,He took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of Italians towards nature and farms .
3154,"Carlo De Blazia , journalist speaking to us from Rome ."
3155,Thank you very much Carlo .
3156,Nice to talk to you .
3157,Thank you .
3158,"Five years ago today , the agreement ending the war in Bosnia was initialed in Dayton Ohio ."
3159,"Western leaders were n't wild about relying on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to help implement the accord , but they felt they had no choice ."
3160,"Five years later , the West and the United States in particular are n't counting on the deposed leader for anything ."
3161,"They want to see his successor Vojislav Kostinica extradite Milosevic through the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague , but not only is Milosevic still living comfortable in Belgrade , last night he made his first TV appearance in six weeks , giving a pep talk to his supporters ."
3162,The World 's Jeb Sharp reports on the still unresolved fate of Slobodan Milosevic .
3163,He 's kept Western diplomats spinning in circles for more than a decade .
3164,Five years ago they were negotiating with Milosevic at Dayton to stop the war in Bosnia .
3165,Two years ago they were still shuttling back and forth to Belgrade in an effort to solve the Kosovo crisis .
3166,By March of last year they had given up talking and Nato had started bombing instead .
3167,"When Milosevic was indited on war crimes charges soon after , US and other Western officials began calling for his arrest and transfer to The Hague , but now that a delicate transition is underway in Serbia , those calls have grown quieter , according to Gary Bass , the author of the new book about war crimes trials , ` Stay , the Hand of Vengeance ' ."
3168,"Even Madeleine Albright , who is with the President who is usually most decipherous about the importance of prosecuting war criminals , has in fact said that our first priority is making sure that Vojislov Kostunica can consolidate his democratic government and make that transition , and the issue of punishing war criminals sort of takes a back seat ."
3169,Bass says US diplomats do n't want to risk destabilizing Serbia 's fragile political situation by pushing too hard for war crimes trials .
3170,"After all Bass points out , outside pressure has backfired in the past ."
3171,"In Germany after World War I and in the Ottoman Empire also after World War I , the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials , and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash ."
3172,"A nationalist backlash in Serbia right now could play into Milosevic 's hands , especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for next month ."
3173,"That 's one reason Western governments are not demanding his immediate arrest , but critics of this approach say letting Milosevic stay in Belgrade could be equally destabilizing ."
3174,"Eva Barnetts , professor of history at Yale , says President Kostunica should cooperate immediately with the Hague Tribunal ."
3175,This particular UN institution has in its power really to give instant legitimacy to Kostunica but of course at a price .
3176,"It means that the government of Yugoslavia has to become very serious about dealing with the indited war criminals , beginning with Slobodan Milosevic himself ."
3177,But even officials at The Hague say they are willing to be patient with the new Yugoslav President .
3178,"Tribunal spokesman Jim Landel says it helps that Kostunica 's people who initially refused to even entertain the idea of arresting Milosevic , may be starting to cooperate with the Tribunal ."
3179,"They have already indicated that they are willing to allow the reopening of the prosecutor 's liaison office in Belgrade , and that 's certainly a welcome first step ."
3180,"However , it is only a first step ."
3181,The Tribunal 's chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte has applied for a Yugoslav visa and plans to visit Belgrade soon .
3182,"Delponte 's spokeswoman says the prosecutor has much to discuss with Kostunica , not least how to arrest all the indited war crimes suspects now in Serbia ."
3183,That wo n't be easy .
3184,"Even in Bosnia where Nato is in charge , troops have failed to capture Bosnian - Serb leader Radavan Karadzic , indited on genocide charges in connection with the 1995 massacre at Shrabanitca ."
3185,Yale history professor Eva Barnett says the excuses for not arresting Karadzic are not persuasive .
3186,"The claim is that this would engender tremendously destabilizing consequences that in any event it might be a very , very bloody affair and so on ."
3187,This does not seem terribly compelling to me .
3188,"I think that it has to be tried and of course there is always a danger that somebody might get hurt in this , but that is a danger that every attempt at remedying criminal activity has to face ."
3189,Hague prosecutor Carla Del Ponte is prepared to discuss arrest strategies with Kostunica including the use of foreign troops .
3190,It 's difficult to know how he would react .
3191,"Kostunica has questioned the legality of the Hague Tribunal , and talked of trying Milosevic in Yugoslavia ."
3192,"Still , Kostunica 's grace period wo n't last forever ."
3193,"When the US Congress approved one hundred million dollars in aid to Serbia last month , it stipulated the aid would stop flowing if Belgrade has n't cooperated with the tribunal by March 31st ."
3194,"For The World , I am Jeb Sharp ."

3197,Both George W. Bush and Al Gore today continue to press their cases literally and figuratively .
3198,Their PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly .
3199,"Governor Bush 's running mate Dick Cheney talked with reporters about the Republican transition plans , another signal that Bush is getting ready to become the next President of the United States ."
3200,"Meanwhile , Vice President Gore continued his appeal for patience while he contests Bush 's claim to victory , and attorneys for both men were preparing for key court battles later in the week , which could settle the three - week dispute over who won Florida and the presidency ."
3201,The World 's Clark Boyd has the latest .
3202,"All eyes were on Florida yet again today as lawyers , judges , lawmakers and citizens , all picked at the knots that have tied up the conclusion of this presidential election for the past three weeks ."
3203,"Yesterday in Leon County Circuit Court , Judge N. Sander Sauls set a Saturday deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and Palm Beach counties , not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth , to be brought to Tallahassee under police escort ."
3204,"Today , as officials in both two counties ready the ballots for transport , George W. Bush 's lawyers asked the judge to order all 1.16 million ballots from the two counties to be trucked to the state capital ."
3205,"Late this afternoon , Judge Sauls granted that motion ."
3206,"In Washington , Vice President Al Gore was back on television this morning trying to shore up public support for his legal cause ."
3207,"In a taped interview , for NBC 's Today Show , Gore said despite all the legal maneuvering he is calling on both camps to put partisan politics aside ."
3208,"I think that both Governor Bush and I should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of our partisan supporters ."
3209,"Meanwhile , Bush 's vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy man today ."
3210,After a heart checkup at a Washington hospital he appeared at a news conference to say that he is pressing ahead with transition plans .
3211,"We have now acquired office space in McClain , Virginia that will become the site for the transition operation that we announced two days ago , so we are just in a business of getting up and running , but we now have an office with a lot of space ."
3212,"We have got people signing up , volunteers coming on , telephones being put in and computers , so we will be fully operational within the next day or two ."
3213,"Earlier today in Florida , the Republican dominated legislature began hearings on calling a special session to pick the state 's electors itself , should the December 12th deadline still find the election tied up in the courts ."
3214,The committee heard from angry voters and precinct workers in Palm Beach .
3215,I believe our issues do relate directly to the appointing of electors for the state of Florida .
3216,"The electors need to be appointed , are supposed to be appointed according to the will of the people and I believe in Palm Beach County that it was very difficult to determine what the will of the people was ."
3217,"Although Al Gore said today that he certainly feels like he won the election , he put his odds of wining the various legal battles at fifty - fifty ."
3218,"Gore said , if Bush does triumph in court , he will throw his support behind the Republican President - elect ."
3219,"But for now , says former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche , both sides are positive that they 've won the election , and says Riche , the longer the fight goes on , the more troublesome the next four years might be ."
3220,What we risk by prolonging this is greater public cynicism and a hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to work together .
3221,"After all , come January , these people are going to have to be in Washington whether Gore or Bush is the President ."
3222,"You have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work together with the new President and with each other , so we do n't want to prolong this forever ."
3223,"The US Supreme Court will hear arguments from both sides on Friday and Florida 's Leon County Circuit Court will consider the arguments on disputed state ballots on Saturday , and while the nation wearies of the protracted legal battle maybe Leon County Circuit Court judge N. Sander Sauls said it best ."
3224,"The whole process , he said , is a bit like being nibbled to death by a duck ."
3225,"For The World , this is Clark Boyd ."
3226,Russia 's lower house of parliament has overwhelmingly approved restoring the former Soviet anthem as the Russian national anthem .
3227,The move had the strong support of Russian President Vladimir Putin who said use of the old anthem represented a gesture of reconciliation .
3228,Critics argued that the anthem is a throwback to the former totalitarian government .
3229,"The anthem will have new words , eliminating verses that praised Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin ."
3230,"The lower house of parliament also gave formal endorsement to Russia 's white , red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military ."
3231,"From BBC news in London , I am Gregor Cragey for The World ."
3232,George W. Bush has met with Al Gore in Washington .
3233,The two men met for just 15 minutes at the Vice President 's official residence .

3235,Bush went into the talks with his defeated rival after meeting with President Clinton earlier today .
3236,"At a photo opportunity in the Oval Office , Bush thanked the President and fended off an interruption from a veteran White House correspondent ."
3237,"I am humbled and honored , and I ca n't thank the President enough for his hospitality ."
3238,He did n't need to do this .
3239,"Yes , he did ."
3240,I have n't quite finished yet .
3241,And I am grateful and I am going to look forward to the discussion .
3242,I am here to listen .
3243,For his part President Clinton said his only advice to Bush is to assemble a good team and to do what he thinks is right .
3244,Bush is now heading back to Texas .
3245,The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is due to meet with Egypt 's President Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday .
3246,The encounter is being seen as an effort by Barak to drum up regional support for a Middle East peace agreement based on President Clinton 's proposals .
3247,"They require Israel to relinquish sovereignty over most of Arab East Jerusalem and the Palestinians to scale back their demand for a return of refugees , but Palestinian chief negotiator Sayeb Erekat says more details are required before both sides can strike a deal ."
3248,We have so many questions that we have ... so many points that need to be clarified .
3249,The most important thing is the clarity .
3250,The most important thing is that we focus on the travails of the peace process .
3251,Israeli settlers are worried that most of the settlements in the West Bank will be dismantled if an agreement is reached .
3252,The spokeswoman for this Settlers ' Council Yahudi Tayar says this is unacceptable .
3253,"We have a situation where instead of protecting the interests of the Jewish people , the Israeli Prime Minister is willing to forgo on all of the vital and important areas and not only our history , but the security of the future for the Jewish people in Israel ."
3254,More than 300 people have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since September .

3268,"Balkans advisor James O'Brien and President Kostunica met for the first top - level talks between the United States and Yugoslavia , since the break of diplomatic relations on the eve of Nato air strikes in 1999 ."

3270,Balkans envoy O'Brian stressed that the US would begin lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia and that only technical issues remain an obstacle to reestablishing relations .
3271,"However , key sanctions which directly target ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and his allies remain in place ."
3272,"Meanwhile , parties in Slobodan Milosevic 's socialist coalition are making it clear they plan to hold onto control of the Serbian government , despite calls for new elections ."
3273,"Eve Cornet , VOA News , Belgrade ."
3274,"A leading expert on international finance , Johns Hopkins University economist , Steve Hanky says Yugoslavia 's new President Vojislav Kostunica only has a few weeks to reassure financial stability in the dominant republic of Serbia by stabilizing the inflation - prone Yugoslav dinar ."
3275,"VOA 's Barry Wood spoke with Mr. Hanky , who recently returned from several weeks in Europe ."
3276,Mr. Hanky says that President Kostunica has only two options for achieving financial stability in Serbia .
3277,"He can either abandon the dinar and adopt the German mark as the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro has done or , Mr. Hanky says , Serbia can adopt a currency board system under which a new currency would be issued under conditions of utmost financial discipline ."
3278,"I think if Kostunica does not move in a direction decisively within the next month of abandoning the dinar completely or going to a deutsche mark based currency board where we have a foreign governor on the board , the chances for economic unification in the area and economic recovery in Serbia are slim at best ."
3279,"Mr. Hanky says it 's essential that President Kostunica embrace the principle of sound money , something Mr. Hanky believes is as important as the rule of law ."
3280,"Last week , the new acting head of the Yugoslav Central Bank devalued the dinar , bringing it to 30 to the dollar , compared to the previous official rate of 20 ."
3281,"Mr. Hanky , who regards the dinar as the world 's worst currency , says the deutsch mark is becoming the de facto money in the entire Balkan region ."
3282,"If they use the d mark in Serbia , obviously there would be essentially the same system that they have in Montenegro and if they had a currency board with a foreign national running the thing , like Bosnia , it would essentially mean that they had a unified system was what they have in Montenegro because with Montenegro , they would still have the d mark as legal tender , but they would also use this new currency board money from Serbia and there would be absolutely no problem , and furthermore , from a regional point of view , you 'd have essentially most of the Balkans in a unified currency zone because Bulgaria has a currency board that 's d mark based ."
3283,Bosnia has a currency board that 's d mark based .
3284,"Kosovo has a d mark , Montenegro has a d mark ."
3285,Mr. Hanky was instrumental in developing the deutsche mark based currency systems throughout the region .
3286,Advisors to Mr. Kostunica say they are considering a currency board system for Serbia .
3287,"Barry Wood , VOA News , Washington ."

3297,"In the latest daily CNN USA Today Gallup popular opinion survey , George W Bush , the Governor of Texas , the Republican nominee , holds a 49 % to 42 % advantage over his Democratic opponent Al Gore , the Vice President , but two other major surveys gave Mr. Bush only a one - point lead ."
3298,"On Sunday , several major newspapers weighed in with their endorsements and VOA 's Peter Hymline has that story ."
3299,"In its Sunday editions , the New York Times calls Vice President Gore , the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government , his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision making and his devotion to the general welfare ."
3300,"The Times editorial says Mr. Gore has , in its words , struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration 's ethical lapses ."
3301,"The paper 's editorial board goes on to say , we believe Mr. Gore would never follow Bill Clinton 's example of reckless conduct that cheapens the Presidency ."
3302,"The Times also praise Republican candidate George W Bush for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but the writers said they had concluded Mr. Bush 's agenda was harsh on issues such as women 's rights , guns , and law enforcement ."
3303,"The Times joins the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave its backing to Mr. Gore ."
3304,"Other major dailies throwing their support to the Vice President Sunday included The Philadelphia Inquirer , The Denver Post and The San Jose California Mercury News ."
3305,Mr. Bush also picked up some key endorsements Sunday including both major Chicago papers .
3306,"In its editorial , The Chicago Tribune called Mr. Gore a decent man but concluded that , in its words , his penchant for enhancement has become something of a running joke ."
3307,"The Tribune endorsement says this is an election about honesty , about restoring bipartisanship , about fostering government that will nurture a booming economy without getting in the way of American ingenuity ."
3308,The paper concludes that there is one candidate who will do that and that is George W Bush .
3309,The battle of the editorials reflects what many political analysts predict will be one of the closest Presidential races in decades .
3310,Most opinion polls give Mr. Bush a slight lead but a just released survey by Newsweek magazine puts the text .

3413,Educating Taiwanese Kids in the PRC

3415,"When Taiwanese business people take up an expatriate lifestyle , the thing they worry about most is family matters , especially the education of their growing children ."
3416,"For Taiwanese expatriates in mainland China , incompatibility between the Taiwanese and mainland education systems is the main reason why most of them do not move their families across with them ."
3417,"In the city of Dongguan , located just over 40 kilometers east of Guangzhou , the ground has already been broken on a project to build the first school for Taiwanese children in mainland China ."
3418,"There is an especially large Taiwanese expatriate community in the Dongguan area , and there are high hopes that the new school , scheduled to begin officially enrolling students in September , will go a long way toward solving the nettlesome problem of education ."
3419,""" Sometimes I get to thinking that I 've achieved absolutely everything I set out to do in life , "" says H. D. Ye , "" then I take a look at my family 's situation and it seems as though I have n't really done anything at all . """
3420,"As chairman of the board at Dongguan Primax Electronics Products , Ye has nine factories and over 4,000 employees under him ."
3421,Why would someone so successful be so down about his situation ?
3422,"Says Ye with a worried frown , "" Recently my wife has been calling me a lot from Canada to talk about her problems trying to maintain discipline with our kids ."
3423,"They 're getting out of control , and we 're afraid they might get into trouble ."
3424,"They say it 's tough to try and raise children as an expatriate , and I can sure attest to that . """
3425,I 'm doing this for you
3426,"Ye has worked hard for many years for the Taiwanese community in Dongguan , a subject he cares deeply about ."
3427,""" I do n't care if it 's nothing more than a thatched - roof cottage ; I want to get a school for Taiwanese children up and running . """
3428,"After stepping down from his former position as chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen Association of Dongguan -LRB- TBAD -RRB- , Ye took over as director of the Dongguan Taiwanese School Preparatory Committee ."
3429,"Says Ye , "" I 'm even busier now than I was before . """
3430,"Of the more than 3,000 Taiwanese business people in Dongguan , less than 5 % have been joined by their families ."
3431,"With the extended absence of these people from Taiwan , undisciplined children and lonely spouses "" cause a lot of problems for families and society as a whole , "" says Ye ."
3432,There are a number of reasons why family members are unwilling to move to the mainland -
3433,"some spouses have jobs in Taiwan , crime is a concern on the mainland , and the quality of medical care is not so good there ."
3434,"For people with families , however , the key stumbling block is the quality of education ."
3435,"Asks Sylvia Yang , deputy chairperson of the TBAD Women 's Division , "" What are we working to achieve , anyway ?"
3436,"We want a better life for our children , of course . """
3437,"She adds that while the education system on the mainland is not so bad , Taiwanese people have a hard time getting used to the way of life there ."
3438,""" How would you feel if your child learned from his classmates to cough up phlegm all over the place ?"
3439,"Sorry , but that 's not something you can get used to . """
3440,"Grumbles one businessman , "" My kids have come home singing the national anthem of the PRC , and calling Chiang Kai - shek a thug and Lee Teng - hui a public enemy ."
3441,"Now how do I handle something like that ? """
3442,"In the opinion of Norman Hsu , vice president of a foods company whose family of four had spent a few years in New Zealand before moving to Dongguan , "" The first thing to do is ask the children their reason for saying such things ."
3443,"Ask what their teachers say , and what they themselves think ."
3444,"Then go on to give them your own views . """
3445,"While many consider Hsu 's approach a very enlightened one , there is no denying that at the gut level the influence of mainland Chinese culture rubs the wrong way ."
3446,"Comments one Taiwanese businessman , "" You worry that your kid is going to become a communist . """
3447,"Taiwanese people in the mainland invariably wish to maintain their ties with Taiwan , and are particularly anxious to ensure that their children can integrate quickly into the school system back home once they return ."
3448,"With the number of Taiwanese in Dongguan increasing in recent years , it was just a matter of time before a Taiwanese school was established ."
3449,"Thanks to the vigorous advocacy of H. D. Ye , the TBAD began working seriously in 1994 to establish a school , but the difficulties were considerable ."
3450,"They had to find land , funds , teachers , and much more ."
3451,"With Taiwanese and mainland authorities at political loggerheads , the school 's promoters had to jump through hoops every step of the way in seeking to hire teachers from Taiwan , use Taiwanese teaching materials , and appoint a Taiwanese person to the post of principal ."
3452,They also had to obtain the cooperation of the authorities in Taiwan .
3453,"Since the people in Dongguan were paying taxes in Taiwan and planning to run the school according to the Taiwanese system , they asked whether the Ministry of Education might not treat the school the same as any private school in Taiwan , and subsidize it accordingly ."
3454,"Teacher seniority was also a major issue in the effort to get the school established ; if teachers from public schools were to teach in Dongguan , would they retain the seniority that they had built up in Taiwan ?"
3455,""" If we had n't been able to hire experienced teachers , "" notes Ye , "" it would have seriously impaired the quality of our faculty . """
3456,"Ye continually stressed to authorities in both Taiwan and the mainland , "" Politics is for the politicians ."
3457,"In the meantime , our children need an education ."
3458,"That 's all we 're asking . """
3459,The main obstacles were finally overcome by the end of 1999 .
3460,The mainland Chinese authorities have agreed to allow the use of Taiwanese teaching materials and faculty .
3461,"As for the appointment of a principal , TBAD vice chairman Andrew Yeh states , "" I think the mainland authorities will handle the situation flexibly ."
3462,"They 'll probably let us hire who we want as long as we agree to refer to the person as a director or something like that . """
3463,"The Dongguan city government has leased an 86,000 - square - meter site to the association at an extremely low price , and the school 's cornerstone was laid last year in a ceremony held on 3 November ."
3464,The school will begin admitting students this coming September and start classes in October .
3465,The school will accept elementary and junior high school students at first .
3466,The decision about whether to open senior high school classes will be made later depending on demand .
3467,Where to send the kids ?
3468,H. D. Ye notes that there are now about 400 children of Taiwanese expatriates in Dongguan who attend school in the mainland .
3469,"Greater than half attend mainland China 's regular elementary and secondary schools , while the more affluent Taiwanese send their children to private schools for expatriate children ."
3470,"Chang Mei - liang , chairperson of the TBAD Women 's Division , is among the latter group ."
3471,After her elder son and daughter finished elementary school in Taiwan she sent them to a boarding school in Britain .
3472,"Her ten - year - old child is too young for that though , so she sends him to a school in Shenzhen for the children of Hong Kong expats ."
3473,"The child only comes home once a week , and sending him to the school in Shenzhen costs several hundred thousand NT dollars per year ."
3474,"The Hong Kong elementary school and the international school are both an hour or two away from Dongguan , and many of the Taiwanese in Dongguan want to be able to see their children every day ."
3475,This prompted a group of them to establish a private bilingual school called Little Oxford in February 1998 .
3476,The school admits children from kindergarten -LRB- age five -RRB- through grade five of elementary school .
3477,"Some of Little Oxford 's 200 students -LRB- such as Norman Hsu 's child -RRB- used to go to school in Shenzhen , while others have transferred in from the mainland Chinese public school system ."
3478,Little Oxford is very similar to the Taiwanese school being promoted by the TBAD .
3479,"Most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in Taiwan 's elementary schools , and of the 15 or so teachers there , three are from Taiwan ."
3480,The big difference is that classes are taught in both Chinese and English because the Taiwanese parents are very interested in seeing that their children learn English well .
3481,"According to Huang Su , executive director of Little Oxford , "" A lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children 's education is exactly like the regular system in Taiwan , but I have to remind them that once you 've left in Taiwan , you 're not regular any longer . """
3482,"According to Huang , making the school a mirror image of those in Taiwan does not necessarily mean that you are running a good school ."
3483,The key is to provide an education that meets the needs of the students .
3484,"In addition to Taiwanese teaching materials , she has also incorporated some materials from the mainland and overseas into the curriculum ."
3485,"Huang Su , who hails from Beijing , majored in English at university and is keenly interested in education ."
3486,"She came to Dongguan after marrying a Taiwanese expat there , and it was the Taiwanese business community that asked her to run a school ."
3487,Little Oxford now has a very good reputation in the Taiwanese community .
3488,"In fact , some Taiwanese send their children to Little Oxford from as far away as Zhuhai -LRB- just opposite Macau on the other side of the Pearl River estuary -RRB- ."
3489,Huang has been deeply impressed by the deep concern that Taiwanese parents show for their children 's education in the face of difficulties posed by living away from their native Taiwan .
3490,"One parent , for example , practically begged her to admit his six - year old child , explaining , "" He 's never had any playmates ."
3491,"The only people he 's ever been with are his nanny and some employees from the plant . """
3492,The Taiwanese kids at Little Oxford come from many different backgrounds .
3493,"Some speak in a mixture of Chinese and English , while others speak and look just like any mainland Chinese child ."
3494,"Many of them have transferred in and out of lots of different schools in the United States , Taiwan , and the mainland ."
3495,There is no trace of the world 's cares on their faces though ; the thing they 're most concerned about is studying a little less and playing a little more .
3496,"One bespectacled child laments , "" School is better in Canada because they do n't have to do so much homework ."
3497,There 's too much homework in Taiwan and the mainland .
3498,"It 's no fun . """
3499,"An older brother and sister , it turns out , have both lived overseas ."
3500,Huang stays in close touch with the Taiwanese parents .
3501,"Their children enjoy very comfortable homes and seem to have experienced much of the world , but the biggest problem is that "" they are n't motivated and do n't understand why they should need to study . """
3502,Another problem for the school is the lack of interesting things to do in Dongguan .
3503,"Unless teachers are very devoted to education , they are not likely to stay there long ."
3504,""" It 's all the more difficult , "" notes Huang frankly , "" to hold on to teachers from Taiwan , who ca n't help but compare their situation here with what they are accustomed to in Taiwan . """
3505,The Taiwanese school will be faced with the same high turnover rate that has dogged Little Oxford .
3506,"Dongguan , cradle of scholars"
3507,"With Little Oxford already in operation , why should the Taiwanese expats wish to establish a separate school for their children ?"
3508,"Sylvia Yang points out that Little Oxford is a private school with limited space and teaching staff , and even without the boarding expenses charged in Shenzhen , the tuition at Little Oxford still costs RMB 38,000 -LRB- NT$ 160,000 -RRB- per semester , more than many Taiwanese parents can pay ."
3509,"Says H. D. Ye , "" We would like to get funding from both the Taiwan and mainland authorities to hold tuition down . """
3510,"Although the cornerstone has already been laid , Ye reports that not enough funds have been raised , nor have all the teachers been hired ."
3511,"Although the picture generally looks pretty good , there is still much work to be done ."
3512,"Expenses for the first few years are expected to reach NT$ 60 million , and only about NT$ 20 million has been raised so far ."
3513,"Ye often speaks in Taiwan on the topic of investing in the mainland , something which he knows a lot about ."
3514,"Says Ye jokingly , "" I jack up my speaking fees to make extra money for the school . """
3515,"The TBAD is now considering funding the school through an endowment , shares in which would be sold to business firms ."
3516,The location for the school has already been selected .
3517,It is a large site in the township of Zhongtang .
3518,"The lot is basically empty right now , but the roar of excavators fills the air , and the steel piles have already been driven ."
3519,"The school grounds are located next to the ancient Beidi Temple , which is shaded by the leaves of a spreading banyan tree ."
3520,"On the temple gate a fading couplet reads : "" He who is truly dedicated to his endeavor will become a great master , and shall make of his surroundings a land of delight ."
3521,"He who has achieved true wisdom shall make of his home a cynosure for great talent , no matter where he may be . """
3522,"The locals must have taken this message to heart over the years , because it is said that hometown scholars from Zhongtang often took the top spot in the imperial examinations of centuries past ."
3523,"It is very gratifying that a place like Dongguan , with its abundant business opportunities , should also have a scenic spot so rich in scholarly tradition ."
3524,It is also exciting to look forward to the founding of a school for the Taiwanese business community .
3525,"Apart from making money , will the expatriates here create a "" Taiwanese miracle "" on the cultural front as well ?"
3526,p. 91
3527,"Little Oxford , a bilingual elementary school attended primarily by the children of Taiwanese expatriates , guards its entranceway closely ."
3528,"A school bus takes students to and from school , and all visitors must announce themselves before entering ."
3529,p. 92
3530,"Little Oxford elementary school teaches classes in both Chinese and English , which is just what the Taiwanese expatriates want for their children ."
3531,p. 93
3532,H. D. Ye is a key player in Dongguan 's Taiwanese expatriate community .
3533,He has played the lead role in establishing a Taiwanese school in Dongguan .
3534,The community 's ability to wrap up preparations and start construction in just two years is due in large part to Ye 's energy and enthusiasm .
3535,Taiwan News Holds Seminar on Cross-Strait Relations
3536,The biggest story of the year in Taiwan has naturally been the changing of the guard at the presidential palace as a result of the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- victory in the election on 18 March .
3537,"Jin Zhong , president and editor - in - chief of Hong Kong 's OPEN magazine , which specializes in political reporting and commentary , spent an entire week in Taiwan observing the election campaign and its aftermath , and on 20 March , OPEN organized a seminar titled "" The New President and Cross-Strait Relations . """
3538,"The seminar was held in cooperation with Taiwan News , one of the island 's oldest English - language newspapers -LRB- known until last year as the China News -RRB- ."
3539,"The KMT ticket finished nearly 14 percentage points behind independent candidate James Soong and pulled in fully two million votes fewer than the DPP ticket , a margin of defeat which Jin Zhong described in his opening remarks as stunning ."
3540,"When Chinese Communist premier Zhu Rongji made belligerent remarks a few days before the election in an effort to scare voters away from the DPP ticket , the ruling party made a grievous mistake , opined Jin , when it failed to come out strongly critical of Zhu and attempted instead to capitalize on the incident by playing the "" fear card . """
3541,"At the same time , however , winning candidate Chen Shui - bian captured only 39 % of the vote , which translates to a weak mandate ."
3542,"As a result , he must take a moderate line that stresses inter-party cooperation ."
3543,"He will have to include a wide range of people in his government , keep a low profile , guard against any temptation to grow imperious in power , and strive to be a president of all the people ."
3544,"As for mainland China 's saber - rattling , Jin argued that there is no need for undue concern ."
3545,"Stated Jin , "" The consequences would be too severe ."
3546,It 's not like Taiwan is without any means of retaliation .
3547,"Are the mainland authorities really prepared to see Hong Kong and Shanghai go up in flames ? """
3548,"There are other perspectives on cross-strait relations , of course ."
3549,The seminar participants basically fell into three camps on future prospects .
3550,"Some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy ."
3551,"Perhaps the most optimistic view was expressed by Ruan Ming , a visiting professor at Tamkang University 's Department of China Studies who in the 1980s was an assistant to former Chinese Communist Secretary General Hu Yaobang ."
3552,Ruan stated that Beijing 's basic position on Taiwan has not changed at all since the days of Deng Xiaoping .
3553,""" There 's nothing new in what they 're saying . """
3554,"The only thing the Chinese Communists are saying , says Ruan , is that they will attack "" if Taiwan makes any sort of formal move toward independence , "" and Taiwan has no need to formalize anything because changing the country 's name would be meaningless ."
3555,""" No matter what you call yourself , people are still going to call you Taiwan ."
3556,"It 's just like in England - the official name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , but nobody calls it that ."
3557,"And there 's no need to going around shouting , ' We 're a country ! We 're a country ! '"
3558,"Who in the international community does that ? """
3559,"Pragmatism , please"
3560,""" Taiwan needs to be more pragmatic , "" says Ruan , "" just like the mainland . """
3561,"They made a lot of noise ahead of the election trying to sway votes , but once the election was over they backpedaled quickly with the simple statement , "" We 'll wait and see what they say and do . """
3562,"The attitude with them , in Ruan 's view , is very pragmatic ."
3563,"Ruan is optimistic about cross-strait relations under the new regime , and states , "" Chen Shui - bian is best positioned to improve cross-strait relations . """
3564,"He likens Chen to the staunchly anti-communist Richard Nixon , who was able to normalize ties with the Chinese Communists precisely because he was trusted by the American people ."
3565,"Similarly , when Chen Shui - bian negotiates with Beijing , no one will worry about him selling Taiwan down the river ."
3566,"The noted political commentator Chin Heng - wei , chief editor of Taiwan 's Contemporary Monthly , agreed strongly with Ruan 's comments , and added , "" In this election the people of Taiwan were even more concerned about domestic issues than they were about cross-strait relations . """
3567,"The most pressing issues facing the new president are education , the environment , "" black gold "" politics -LRB- murky connections between the worlds of politics , business , and organized crime -RRB- , and crime fighting ."
3568,"When Nobel laureate Lee Yuan - tseh came out in support of Chen Shui - bian , implying that the DPP represented "" the progressive forces in society , "" Chen 's support jumped immediately upward ."
3569,"Virtually everyone at the seminar was in agreement that it is neither advisable nor necessary to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue , and that Taiwan need only avoid stirring up Chinese nationalism ."
3570,Wei Chengsi -LRB- news director at ATV news in Hong Kong and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in Shanghai -RRB- emphasized the fluid nature of Beijing 's policy on Taiwan .
3571,"He feels that the mainland authorities face many more pressing issues than Taiwan , and that the current tension basically stems from President Lee Teng - hui 's pronouncement on state - to - state relations ."
3572,"Having been through the Tiananmen massacre , Wei felt compelled to warn the people of Taiwan , "" You absolutely must not think the way the students did in Beijing in '89 ."
3573,"You must not think that ' the communists wo n't attack because the US wo n't let them , ' and then go out of your way to provoke them to where they no longer have an out ."
3574,"Under the wrong circumstances , failure to display strong Chinese nationalism could spell political suicide for a Communist Party leader , and he might well decide , ' To hell with the US and economic development , I 've got to attack if I 'm to stay in power . '"
3575,"That would be an incredible disaster . """
3576,"Chiu Hsiang - chung , chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal , also advocated cautious optimism ."
3577,"In his view , there has been no fundamental change in the cross-strait relationship , but he listed a few variables that bear close watching ."
3578,The first is the combination of nationalism and Jiang Zemin 's desire to serve another term as Secretary General of the Communist Party and make his mark on history .
3579,Could he attempt to use nationalism to further his ambition ?
3580,"Second , the People 's Liberation Army hopes to parlay the Taiwan issue into increased influence in domestic politics ."
3581,"Third , Taiwan could make mistakes and give the Chinese Communists an excuse for military action ."
3582,And a fourth factor is the wishy - washy American support for Taiwan .
3583,"If all of these variables combined in the wrong way , the military authorities could make a miscalculation that would lead to war ."
3584,When hawk meets hawk
3585,Chou Chi - ping -LRB- senior advisor at Business Weekly -RRB- and Tseng Fu - sheng -LRB- general secretary of the KMT 's Department of Mainland Operations -RRB- felt that the future of cross-strait relations is still up in the air .
3586,"Chou , as a former official with the Straits Exchange Foundation , has had direct dealings with the Chinese Communists ."
3587,"He argued that the DPP 's view of the mainland has always been colored by ideology , and thus take a dim view of the other side ."
3588,"It is true , acknowledges Chou , that Chen Shui - bian has changed his basic stance and now says that he "" will not change the country 's name , declare independence , or seek to enshrine the state - to - state principle in the constitution . """
3589,It is also true that Lee Yuan - tseh -LRB- who is highly respected in the mainland for his academic achievements -RRB- has vouched for the sensibility of Chen 's approach to cross-strait relations .
3590,"And yes , once again , it is true that the Chinese Communists have muted their rhetoric considerably ."
3591,"Nevertheless , the two sides view each other with suspicion ."
3592,"If the Chinese Communists conclude that Taiwan 's leadership has dropped its insistence on formal independence only to pursue a policy that includes de facto independence as its aim , Chou argued that this will introduce a note of uncertainty into the relationship ."
3593,Tseng Fu - sheng feels that Taiwan should claim the high ground by holding up its experience in democratization as an example for the Chinese Communists .
3594,"Says Tseng , "" Reunification depends entirely on whether China can democratize . """
3595,His biggest worry is that the deep gulf between the DPP and the mainland authorities could cause them to misread each other .
3596,"He stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between Beijing , Washington , and Taipei ."
3597,"If the hawks gained the upper hand at the same time in all three capitals , opined Tseng , the result could be war ."
3598,The seminar attendants also examined Taiwan 's domestic situation .
3599,Versatile author and cultural commentator Ping Lu offered some very incisive comments regarding the post-election protests outside the KMT headquarters .
3600,"In demanding that Lee Teng - hui resign as chairman of the KMT to take responsibility for the election defeat , Ping -LRB- herself a second - generation "" mainlander "" -RRB- argued that the protest revealed an ethnic fault line in Taiwanese society ."
3601,"It was a venting of mass frustration on the part of one particular ethnic group , said Ping , noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders ."
3602,"This group feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of KMT rule they have always thought of themselves as a privileged "" majority "" in Taiwan even though in fact they are a minority ."
3603,"They do not identify with Taiwan as their home , and they have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority ."
3604,In some ways the election has forced them to realize that they truly are a minority .
3605,This development should help to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in Taiwan .
3606,The participants generally felt that the election was a victory for democracy .
3607,"On the domestic front , the victory of Chen Shui - bian showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort to banish "" black gold "" from the political arena ."
3608,In cross-strait relations Chen 's victory spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted within the framework of a civil war between he KMT and the Chinese Communist Party .
3609,Reform of the KMT and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in Taiwan .
3610,"It appears that the people of Taiwan have finally taken their first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect ."
3611,President Chen Travels Abroad
3612,-LRB- Chang Chiung - fang / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
3613,"President Chen Shui - bian visited the Nicaraguan National Assembly on August 17 , where he received a medal from the president of the assembly , Ivan Escobar Fornos ."
3614,"-LRB- photo by Wu Chi - chang , Central News Agency -RRB-"
3615,"On August 25 President Chen Shui - bian wrapped up his first overseas trip since taking office , swinging through three countries in Latin America and another three in Africa ."
3616,"While in the Dominican Republic to attend the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia , Chen had a chance to meet with the leaders of many different nations ."
3617,"The president signed joint communiques with Nicaragua , Gambia , and Chad , and agreed to provide US$ 4.6 million worth of loans to the Dominican Republic to serve as a guarantee to help the latter secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund ."
3618,""" We can not use pressure from Beijing as an excuse for our diplomatic setbacks , "" said Chen , who used concrete actions to demonstrate to ROC 's allies that our country has no intention of pulling back from its diplomatic partnerships ; on the contrary , the ROC will be working even harder than before ."
3619,"Chen Shui - bian left on August 13 for a 13 - day trip that included state visits to the Latin American nations of the Dominican Republic , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , as well as the west African nations of Gambia , Burkina Faso , and Chad ."
3620,"Before boarding the plane on the 13th , Chen Shui - bian delivered a short speech in which he stated , "" Taiwan must stand up and be counted . """
3621,"The purpose of this trip , said Chen , is to share Taiwan 's experiences with other countries , and he also indicated the hope that this trip would help to solidify Taiwan 's diplomatic relations ."
3622,"The entourage was the largest ever to accompany an ROC president abroad , and included : Chuang Ming - yao -LRB- secretary - general , National Security Council -RRB- , Tien Hung - mao -LRB- minister of foreign affairs -RRB- , Lin Hsin - yi -LRB- minister of economic affairs -RRB- , Chen Po - chih -LRB- chairman , Council of Economic Planning and Development -RRB- , Chen Hsi - huang -LRB- chairman , Council of Agriculture -RRB- , Chung Chin -LRB- head of the Government Information Office -RRB- , Jeffrey Koo -LRB- chairman of the National Association of Industry and Commerce -RRB- , Wang Yu - tseng -LRB- chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of the ROC -RRB- , and Lin Kun - chung -LRB- chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries -RRB- ."
3623,"There were also many legislators in the delegation , including Hung Chi - chang , Helen Chu , Feng Ting - kuo , and Li Yin - yun ."
3624,"-LRB- Li is soon to assume a position as deputy director of the ROC diplomatic post in Washington , DC . -RRB-"
3625,"The total size of the delegation came to nearly 200 people , including more than 50 journalists ."
3626,The president kept to a very tight schedule during the trip .
3627,"After a brief stopover in Los Angeles on the 13th , Chen continued on and reached the Dominican Republic on the 14th ."
3628,"He attended the presidential inauguration there on the 16th , and was able to meet with the leaders and representatives of friendly nations from around the world ."
3629,"On the 17th he continued on to Nicaragua , where he met with President Arnoldo Aleman and delivered a speech to the Nicaraguan National Assembly ."
3630,"On the 18th , presidents Chen and Aleman signed a joint communique before Chen Shui - bian departed for Costa Rica , where he received the Great Cross of Juan Mora Fernandez , a gold medal which is the nation 's highest award ."
3631,On the 20th he flew across the Atlantic Ocean to Gambia to meet with Gambian President Yahya Jameh before heading on to Burkina Faso and a dinner with President Blaise Compaore .
3632,On the 23rd Chen delivered a speech to the Gambian parliament .
3633,"The next stop on the itinerary was Chad , where Chen dined with Chad 's President Idris Debi ."
3634,On the 25th Chen and Debi signed a joint communique and held a press conference before heading back to Taiwan slightly ahead of schedule to oversee efforts to deal with the powerful Typhoon Bilis .
3635,"Chen 's stopover in Los Angeles was a sensitive subject , for Chen had originally planned an informal meeting with several members of the US Congress ."
3636,"After furious protests from Beijing and discouragement from the US State Department , however , Chen canceled the plan just the day before arriving in Los Angeles ."
3637,"A crowd of 500 to 600 Taiwanese living in the United States showed up to greet the president at his hotel and protest against the US government 's "" caving in to Beijing at the expense of Taiwan . """
3638,"When Chen arrived on the 14th in the Dominican Republic , he was greeted at the airport by over 100 representatives of the Taiwanese business community there , and more than 700 Taiwanese residents threw a party for the president that night at his hotel ."
3639,"The next day , Chen took advantage of the upcoming presidential inauguration to meet with leaders from a number of countries with which the ROC has diplomatic relations , including the vice-president of El Salvador and the second vice president of Panama ."
3640,On the 16th Chen attended the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia .
3641,The ROC contingent was larger than any other at the ceremony .
3642,"The ROC currently has diplomatic relations with 29 countries , half of which are located in Latin America and the Caribbean ."
3643,"In recent years , however , mainland China has continually upgraded its trade links with the ROC 's diplomatic partners ."
3644,The allegiance of a number of these countries may be put to the test in the coming years by various political and economic considerations .
3645,"In the case of the Dominican Republic , for example , supporters of President Mejia announced to the media on the eve of President Chen 's arrival that mainland China was planning to build a large thermal power plant in their country ."
3646,"In addition , the Dominican Republic is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council in 2002 , and will certainly be lobbying for Beijing 's support ."
3647,This situation could affect relations with Taiwan .
3648,"On the bright side , Taiwan has scored a few points of its own in this diplomatic tug of war ."
3649,"When Chen arrived in Costa Rica on the 18th , his hosts departed from the pattern of the past few years by promising to support the ROC s bid for membership in the United Nations ."
3650,"Costa Rica 's President Miguel Rodriguez also accompanied President Chen on a tour of a Taiwanese export processing zone , an orchid farm run by Taiwan Sugar Corporation , and a vocational training school ."
3651,"President Chen departed on the 20th for Africa , where the ROC has eight diplomatic partners ."
3652,Chen Shui - bian is the first ROC president ever to travel to western Africa .
3653,There is little two - way trade between Taiwan and any of the three countries on Chen 's African itinerary .
3654,"Instead , agricultural and economic assistance constitute the mainstays of our diplomatic ties with these countries ."
3655,"Taiwanese agricultural specialists stationed in Burkina Faso have converted 1,000 hectares of desert to arable land , while Taiwanese specialists sent to Gambia have successfully transplanted tomatoes , green beans , okra , and various leafy vegetables from Taiwan and raised them on Gambian soil ."
3656,"In addition to this type of technical assistance , Taiwan has also assisted with various infrastructure projects ."
3657,Taiwan 's most notable contribution to Gambia 's infrastructure is the main terminal at the airport .
3658,"Gambian President Yahya Jameh declared his support for admission of the ROC to the United Nations , and as a gesture of goodwill declared that all holders of ROC passports would henceforth automatically be granted 90 - day landing visas upon arrival in Gambia ."
3659,"President Chen 's trip yielded many positive results and generated a lot of very favorable media coverage , but it was not problem - free ."
3660,"First , as the president was preparing to depart Taiwan , the Nicaraguan foreign minister publicly called upon the ROC to make good on the previous administration 's promise of US$ 100 million in assistance ."
3661,"This remark sparked controversy in Taiwan , where some accused the new government of pursuing the same "" checkbook diplomacy "" practiced by its predecessor ."
3662,"Chen Shui - bian responded that while the new administration has not made plans for any new promises of foreign aid , neither will it fail to honor the promises made by its predecessor ."
3663,"Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao stated that the purpose of Chen 's trip was to consolidate Taiwan 's diplomatic ties , and to strengthen friendships by building upon the existing foundation ."
3664,Tien stressed that the president would not sign any new foreign aid agreements .
3665,"President Chen received a very warm welcome in Nicaragua , but the local press still mentioned "" checkbook diplomacy "" in reporting on the visit ."
3666,"The ROC 's ambassador to Nicaragua , Antonio Tsai , bluntly argued in a briefing with Chen that Taiwan 's foreign assistance to Nicaragua was being misused ."
3667,"According to Tsai , the assistance has been used to build a presidential palace and a new headquarters for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ."
3668,"Opposition politicians charge that the aid has done nothing for everyday people , and Western nations have also been critical ."
3669,A second problem connected with the trip was the question of who would act in the president 's stead while he was out of the country .
3670,"Concern over this issue prompted President Chen to state before his departure that he would remain commander - in - chief of the military forces , and that he would maintain hot lines to every cabinet - level agency ."
3671,The president said that there was no need for an acting president because he had taken painstaking precautions to ensure domestic political stability during his absence .
3672,So is Taiwan 's diplomacy a way of giving back to the international community ?
3673,Or is it checkbook diplomacy ?
3674,"Ambassador - without - portfolio Lu Yi - cheng wrote an article in which he argued that foreign aid has always been universally recognized as a regular tool of diplomacy as well as a humanitarian necessity , and there is no reason why Taiwan should have to steer clear of it ."
3675,"He pointed out that the world 's developed nations spend an average of 0.24 % of GNP on foreign aid , as opposed to 0.17 % in Taiwan 's case ."
3676,"In view of Taiwan 's economic strength , argued Lu , our foreign aid expenditures need not be reduced ; in fact , they should even be raised somewhat ."
3677,"The ROC has been criticized a lot in recent years for pursuing checkbook diplomacy , so there was no surprise when this issue cropped up in connection with the president 's trip ."
3678,"The question of an acting president , however , has never before been a matter of concern ."
3679,This situation is to some degree a reflection of the fact that the public still has doubts about the new administration 's ability to govern .
3680,This is an important point that is worth keeping in mind .
3681,Paralympics Offer Stage for Taiwan Performers
3682,Closing ceremonies for the 2000 Sydney Paralympics were held on October 29 .
3683,Nearly 4000 athletes from more than one hundred and twenty countries participated .
3684,"This event , a manifestation of the ideal that "" the flame burns in the body , mind , and spirit of every individual , "" broke down international barriers and was an admirable example of the global village in operation ."
3685,"The ROC team took one gold , two silvers , and four bronzes , marking the first time any Taiwan athlete has returned from an Olympic games with a gold ."
3686,"Also , as part of the events , Taiwan 's Crescent Moon Dance Troupe , made up of handicapped persons , was the only foreign troupe invited by the Australian government to participate in the Paralympic Arts Festival ."
3687,But even more important than these honors was the spirit of overcoming all obstacles and facing life with courage that shone through during the Paralympics .
3688,The just - completed Paralympics were enriched by ethnic flavorings .
3689,The opening ceremony on October 18 was in the form of a welcoming for aboriginal elders .
3690,"Amidst a festive atmosphere , the athletes entered the stadium by categories - one group in wheelchairs , another on crutches , another led by guide dogs ."
3691,The events at the 12 - day Paralympics were packed with spectators .
3692,The 1.1 million tickets sold show the extent to which everyone took the games seriously .
3693,"The host government even set up a huge TV screen in Darwin , which is the port of entry for the most visitors to Australia , to broadcast the games live ."
3694,"The games were also a platform for the idea of the welfare state caring for disadvantaged groups , and for emphasizing how handicapped persons can break through barriers and limitations ."
3695,"On October 14 , Taiwan 's Crescent Moon Dance Company created a sensation with their performance "" Standing on the Highest Peak , "" performed in traditional vests and short skirts as worn by indigenous people in Taiwan ."
3696,"After the 10 - minute performance ended , the hall was rocked by thunderous applause ."
3697,"The standing ovation lasted three minutes , and some people were even moved to tears ."
3698,The Crescent Moon Dance Company has only been in operation for four years .
3699,"Organized by a group of amputee women on a nonprofessional basis , it is the world 's first dance troupe of its kind ."
3700,"As its manifesto reads : "" One with no voice may nonetheless sing ."
3701,One with no wings may nonetheless soar .
3702,One with no limbs may nonetheless dance .
3703,"The crescent moon and the full moon are the moon just the same , and equally beautiful . """
3704,The troupe also delighted Sydney citizens with a performance at the Sydney City Hall on October 19 .
3705,"In the competition , host country Australia took the most medals , including 64 golds"
3706,.
3707,"Among the ROC 's medals , the gold - the first ever for Taiwan - was won by Chiang Chih - chung ."
3708,"With a throw of 57.28 meters , Chiang shattered the world record for the javelin in the F12 visually - impaired class ."
3709,"Chiang , a member of the Bunun indigenous people , received a traditional hero 's welcome home from the Bunun of Sanmin Rural Township in Kaohsiung County ."
3710,"During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised Chiang for his glorious deeds ."
3711,"Meanwhile , the ROC table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time ."
3712,"In the wheelchair men 's doubles class 5 event , Chou Chang - sheng and Lin Yen - hung took the silver , while Chou won another silver in the men 's singles ."
3713,"The men 's class 9 team for persons with non-leg - related disabilities and the women 's wheelchair team of combined classes 4 and 5 took bronzes in team events , while Li Ching - chung -LRB- men 's judo class 1 -RRB- and Lu Li - hua -LRB- women 's powerlifting class 1 -RRB- garnered individual bronzes ."
3714,"Among Asian countries , South Korea turned in the best performance , taking five gold medals ."
3715,This was due in part to the fact that the ROK government has provided special coaching in wheelchair table tennis to soldiers injured in service .
3716,"Indeed , many handicapped competitors from other nations besides the ROK were retired veterans ."
3717,"Their pensions allow them free time to train , and through athletics they bring meaning to their lives and glory to their countries ."
3718,"Taiwan team members , on the other hand , come from a variety of backgrounds , and train out of personal interest ."
3719,They must give up working if they wish to train full - time .
3720,"The South Korean team of veterans , by overcoming their injuries to give a display of athleticism at the international level , have emerged from the shadow of war and transformed their handicaps into glorious results ."
3721,This example should provide food for thought to the disabled and sports communities in the future .
3722,"Pali : Storied Past , Uncertain Future"
3723,-LRB- Lin I - hsien / photos by Diago Chiu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
3724,I wonder if Pali is jealous of Tanshui .
3725,"I ask because fate has treated these two towns , separated only by the mouth of the Tanshui River , very differently ."
3726,"Tanshui is celebrated in poems , songs , paintings , and lovers ' memories of its scenic views ."
3727,"Pali has donuts , mussels , a garbage landfill , and troubles which have yet to be revealed to the outside world ."
3728,Have you heard this legend ?
3729,"Liao Tianding , Taiwan 's Robin Hood , fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in Pali , where he fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age 27 , was murdered in the Monkey Cave at Laochienkeng -LRB- in Pali Rural Township -RRB- by one of his best friends ."
3730,"Countless legends grew up around Liao after his death , and the people of Pali began to worship his spirit ."
3731,"In 1958 , his small burial plot was converted into a huge temple ."
3732,"He has followers scattered far and wide , and every year on the special day appointed for making offerings at his temple -LRB- the 26th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar -RRB- , the grounds are packed with cars and visitors ."
3733,"The Ko brothers , now in their 60s , recall their impressions of a visit to the Liao Tianding gravesite : "" It must have been 30 years ago , we used to go there just for the fun of it ."
3734,"The road in front of the temple was n't so wide then , and what a crowd !"
3735,"People were so jammed in you could n't move . """
3736,"They also recall that the Pali of those days was a place in which most people lived by fishing , farming , or petty trading ."
3737,"The elder Ko gives a thumbs - up and declares : "" That 's why I always say that a can - do guy like Liao Tianding must be looking after us , so that we have developed and can even earn money from the tourists . """
3738,"Yet , he may not know about Pali 's real heyday , long in the past ."
3739,The days of the sailing ships
3740,"Pali was originally called Palifen , a transliteration of the place name used by the Ketagalan indigenous people ."
3741,"Located on the northwest corner of Taiwan , Pali faces the Taiwan Strait to the northwest , rests against Mt. Kuanyin to the southeast , and looks across the river toward Tanshui to the northeast ."
3742,"Though it does n't have much of a hinterland , its geographic location has proved historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the Ta - pen - keng and Shih - san - hang archeological sites ."
3743,"Later , when Han Chinese began trickling across to Taiwan , they mainly settled along rivers ."
3744,"Because Pali is relatively close to the mainland and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that it does not have a natural harbor , in 1757 the Qing court designated it to be one of Taiwan 's small number of official ports for maritime transport with the mainland ."
3745,Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of Pali .
3746,"However , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in 1796 , Pali began to give way in importance to Tanshui , located just across the river ."
3747,"Once mainly dependent on fishing , Pali increasingly came to rely on farming ."
3748,But the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .
3749,"While the hardy people of Pali barely kept their stomachs filled , their children and grandchildren left in search of a better life ."
3750,Neither the Japanese occupation -LRB- which began in 1895 -RRB- nor the return to Chinese rule -LRB- in 1945 -RRB- brought much joy or change to this rural area .
3751,"But in the 1970s , urban planning came to Pali ."
3752,It proved to be the prelude to a symphony -LRB- or perhaps cacophony -RRB- of transformation .
3753,Changing the rhythm of Pali life
3754,"During the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in Taipei , builders put up self - described "" villas "" and "" mansions "" -LRB- apartment blocks , in fact -RRB- one after another in Pali ."
3755,"Also , to try to reduce the outflow of population from Pali and to get the stagnant local economy moving , the government decided to link this formerly isolated village to the outside world ."
3756,"What had been Chungshan Road was turned into Provincial Highway #15 , and the opening of the Kuantu Bridge to traffic linked Pali directly to the busy Taipei districts of Shilin and Peitou ."
3757,"Gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , Pali began to dream of a tourism boom ."
3758,But fortune had other things in store .
3759,"In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of Pali , the plan to develop tourism in Pali was scrapped overnight ."
3760,"The government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility ."
3761,"Then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western Taiwan for construction purposes , and a harbor was built on the Pali coast for the convenience of gravel transporters ."
3762,"In accordance with the urban plan , new streets were cut this way and that through Pali 's land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways ."
3763,The sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .
3764,"In 1997 , the Hsiachuotzu garbage landfill formally opened , and it became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of Pali ."
3765,"This rural township , which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in Taipei County , seemed resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered by many outlying areas -RRB- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others ."
3766,"It is only recently that the residents of Hsiachuotsu , unable to stand the smell , have begun to protest ."
3767,"Lin Yi - hung , born and raised in Pali , stands on the roof of his house and looks across to the beach where he used to run and play as a child ."
3768,"He can not help but sigh , as he looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that have come to this area : "" These construction projects have destroyed the relationship we people of Pali used to have with the sea . """
3769,It 's certainly true that a lot of people here thought they would get rich from the rezoning .
3770,"But just because land increases in value does n't mean someone will buy it , and just because apartment complexes are built does n't mean there are people who want to live there ."
3771,"Worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned in the struggle over divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money is involved ."
3772,"Lin concludes : "" I am not by any means opposed to development ."
3773,But development is not necessarily the same as progress .
3774,"Can the people of Pali really survive change of this magnitude ? """
3775,All part of the plan ?
3776,"One after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of Pali residents ."
3777,"But so far the only things Pali folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an "" otherworldly "" kind ."
3778,The new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious to escape from Taipei City and return to nature .
3779,"But at the same time , verdant Mt. Kuanyin - named for its uncanny resemblance to the deity Kuanyin - is covered with columbariums and cemeteries ."
3780,"Even Kuanyin , worshipped for her limitless compassion and mercy , must be creasing her brow at this rampant overuse of the mountain ."
3781,"Chen Chien - kuo , a secretary in the Pali Rural Township government , says facetiously : "" What can we do ? We have the mountains behind us and the sea in front ."
3782,"People say the fengshui is good here , so they come . """
3783,"He adds , in a far less amused tone , that the government has been talking about making Mt. Kuanyin a national park for a long time , and has banned construction or use of the mountain ."
3784,"But after 30 years , the park plan is still a non-starter , and meanwhile many cemeteries and colum - bariums have "" snuck in . """
3785,""" Nobody seems to care about our Pali , and we are very remote , so people just dump what they do n't want out here ."
3786,"We say that this is why we not only have a water pollution treatment plant and a garbage landfill , but also five nursing homes and hospices for the terminally ill . """
3787,Take the Taipei Happy Mountain Colony for example .
3788,"This venerable institution was first used to house leprosy victims , who met only fear and loathing elsewhere ."
3789,"In 1932 , a British missionary founded this home - over the strong opposition of the local gentry - to offer leprosy victims a place to live in dignity and find warmth away from the cold outside world ."
3790,"Today , Happy Mountain is a home for physically and mentally challenged young people , and the simple old structure , surrounded by greenery , rings with the laughter of children ."
3791,"Li Li - chuan , who works at Happy Mountain , was born and raised right here in Pali ."
3792,Her family home is not far from the chil - dren 's home .
3793,""" When I was small I used to come here to play ."
3794,All the adults called the kids ' empty - headed . '
3795,"I was small , and did n't know any better , so I just called them that too . """
3796,"Stroking the head of a sleeping child with hydrocephalus , she says : "" He is so cute when he smiles ! """
3797,"Located on the margins of the island of Taiwan , the people of Pali take it in stride that they must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast off by society - waste water , trash , the deceased , and victims of diseases that society would prefer not to see at all ."
3798,And there is no sign this situation will end : Reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved to Linkou for a land reclamation project there will be trucked along Provincial Highway #15 - right through the heart of Pali .
3799,Serving Greater Taipei
3800,""" I believe , "" says Lin Yi - hung , "" that the people of Pali understand that this is just the way society works -"
3801,"the interests of the few are sacrificed so that the majority can be better off . """
3802,"Thus , in urban plans Pali is always assigned the role of serving Taipei ."
3803,""" But the government should think carefully about whether they are using the right methods or not ."
3804,"There are no real comprehensive policies , just short - term trade - offs of interests ."
3805,"There are a lot of great - sounding plans , but what do the people of Pali get out of them ?"
3806,It 's like the port they built for transporting gravel .
3807,"There are a lot of bright promises for the future , raising people 's hopes , but who knows what the final result will really be ? """
3808,"Chang Tsu - chou , now in his 70s , has been a secretary in the rural township government for more than 30 years , and loves Pali more than words can say ."
3809,""" I was first sent here to work in the Kuomintang Public Service Department ."
3810,"When I came here , they were only selling about 30 newspapers in all of Pali ."
3811,"But I went all out to promote newspaper sales , and by the time I left the department , they were selling more than 1000 ! """
3812,"He has great confidence in Pali 's future , and believes the new harbor will bring prosperity ."
3813,""" The government says that the first phase is for transporting gravel , but when the third phase is completed a lot of goods will be shipped in and out of here ."
3814,"At that time , Pali should really be hopping ! """
3815,"Pali , known as "" the home of green bamboo shoots "" for its famous local vegetable , is - like many remote areas all over Taiwan - accepting the pain and enjoying the pleasures of life in the space between hopeful expectations and disappointing letdowns ."
3816,"And , being marginal , it also must live with burdens that the citizens themselves do not want ."
3817,"Uncertain whether to makes fists or open their arms , the people of Pali watch , perplexed , as the great wheel of our times leaves its tracks through their rural township ."
3818,"Yet these are hardy people , who will always bounce back with a smile to face the unknown future , be it filled with troubles or glory ."
3819,Pali Facts and Figures

3840,Mourn for the End of an Era : Three Taiwanese Cultural Giants
3841,-LRB- Laura Li / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
3842,The year 2001 has started with a series of saddening losses in the cultural realm .
3843,"On the first of the year , Hsu Tsang-houei , the dean of Taiwanese music , passed away after a fall left him in a coma ."
3844,"Then came the news that Chang Kwang-chih , the respected archeologist and former vice-president of the Academia Sinica , had died of illness in the United States ."
3845,"Finally , on the afternoon of January 9 , the historian Tai Kuo-hui died of septicemia ."
3846,These three masters in their fields were all in their early seventies .
3847,"Since they had just reached a time in their lives and careers where they could slow down and enjoy the fruits of their past labors , one feels inclined to complain to heaven or sigh about the brevity of life ."
3848,"Each of these men was at the forefront of his field in Taiwan , and their deaths represent the end of an era ."
3849,Where should Chinese music go ?
3850,Hsu Tsang-houei had a huge impact on Taiwanese music over the last half century .
3851,"Born in Homei , Changhua in 1928 , Hsu studied the violin in Japan as a youth ."
3852,"Later , he studied in France for five years , where he became well versed in the various schools of modern Western music ."
3853,In 1959 he returned to introduce modern Western classical music to his homeland .
3854,"He also published a seminal essay entitled , "" Where Should Chinese Music Go ? "" in which he passionately urged his fellow musicians to create contemporary Chinese music ."
3855,Many young composers took up his call and wrote difficult and dissonant twelve - tone works that would become the creative mainstream in music departments .
3856,"Unfortunately , schools of modern classical music struggled to hold their audiences even in the West , and audiences found it harder and harder to connect with the Taiwanese modern music of which Hsu was the leading figure ."
3857,Opinion has remained polarized about the worth of this music .
3858,Hsu was also at the forefront of efforts to record traditional Taiwanese folk music .
3859,"In the mid-1960s , Hsu , Shih Wei-liang , Lu Ping-chuan and others established various organizations , including the Folk Music Research Workshop ."
3860,"Fighting the reigning bias in favor of musical traditions from the mainland , Hsu led the way in collecting and recording Taiwanese Nanguan music and Hakka eight - tone , as well as the music of the aboriginal tribes ."
3861,These collections helped to delineate the history of Taiwanese music .
3862,"In the past decade , with the rise of the "" Taiwan first "" movement in politics , Hsu 's folk music collections have garnered more and more attention , and CDs of them have been released one after another ."
3863,"In the last few years , Hsu was appointed both as national policy advisor to the president and as the chairman of the National Culture and Arts Foundation ."
3864,Cross-strait archeological star
3865,"Just as Hsu 's work spanned from the classical to the contemporary , from the West to his native soil , the archaeologist Chang Kwang-chih 's broad vision allowed him to build the foundations for the field of archeology both for Taiwan and China as a whole ."
3866,"In his autobiography , Chang describes himself as a "" Yam Man , "" which is an allusion to Taiwan being shaped like a yam ."
3867,"Chang explains that he was actually born in Beijing , though his father 's family was indeed from Taiwan ."
3868,"After Taiwan was returned to Chinese rule , Chang returned to the land of his roots ."
3869,"Studying at Chienkuo High in 1949 , he was arrested on false charges of having participated in the April 6 Incident ."
3870,He spent nearly a year in jail before taking the high school equivalency exam and going on to study archeology at NTU .
3871,"After earning his doctorate at Harvard , he took an academic post in America but always maintained his focus on Chinese archeology ."
3872,"Largely due to his unflagging efforts , Chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline ."
3873,His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley .
3874,"Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape ."
3875,"This overturned the "" single origin theory "" and debunked Western assumptions about "" oriental despotism . """
3876,"Though a world-class scholar , Chang never forgot the land of his origins ."
3877,"In the 1960s , he returned to Taiwan and embarked on research at the Fengpitou site in Kaohsiung , completing the most extensive archeological study made in Taiwan in over a century ."
3878,Then he went on to perform research in an area that spanned the Choshui and Tatu river valleys .
3879,It was a huge undertaking that involved both archeology and geology .
3880,Many of the leading lights among the younger generation of Taiwan anthropologists cut their research teeth on this project .
3881,"Unfortunately , Chang Kwang-chih became afflicted with Parkinson 's disease more than a decade ago ."
3882,"His limbs started to shake , and it became impossible for him to perform fieldwork ."
3883,Chang deeply regretted that he was unable to examine the Shangqiu site in eastern Henan .
3884,"Though sick , Chang returned home at the end of his life to serve as vice president of the Academia Sinica , where he worked hard to establish Taiwan as the preeminent world center for sinology ."
3885,"Taiwanese heart , Chinese sentiments"
3886,"Finally there was the death of the historian Tai Kuo-hui , who served on the National Security Council and was admired as much for his lofty character as for his pioneering work in Taiwanese history ."
3887,His differences of opinion with Lee Teng-hui had thrust him into the spotlight in recent years .
3888,"Born in 1931 in Taoyuan , Tai was educated under Japanese colonial rule , and he earned a doctorate in agriculture at Tokyo ."
3889,"Back in the 1960s , when Taiwanese history was still a taboo subject in Taiwan , Tai organized a research society in Japan devoted to the study of Taiwanese history and other related Asian topics ."
3890,"For this work , he was blacklisted in Taiwan ."
3891,"Later , Tai repeatedly declined invitations from Chiang Ching-kuo to return ."
3892,It was n't until Lee Teng-hui was president that he finally came home .
3893,"But when he did , his different perspective about Taiwan history brought Tai Kuo-hui farther and farther from the mainstream of the ruling party ."
3894,"Although Tai did n't flinch from condemning the authoritarianism of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo , he also had harsh things to say about Japanese colonial rule - unlike Lee Teng-hui , who had fond memories of the colonial era ."
3895,"Tai , who described himself as an "" independent-minded Chinese born in Taiwan , "" never lost his affection for China proper , and these sentiments set him apart from most historians of Taiwan ."
3896,"With regard to cross-strait relations , Tai made his famous "" testicles analogy . """
3897,"Taiwan is a part of China , he stated , just as testicles are a part of a man 's body ."
3898,"Though inextricably linked to the body , the testicles have their own special functions ."
3899,He based his analogy on what he deemed was best for all of the Chinese people .
3900,His theory was a far cry from Lee Teng-hui 's belief that Taiwan should establish clear boundaries between itself and the mainland .
3901,But Tai Kuo-hui never shied from controversy .
3902,"Otherwise , he would not have chosen to study Taiwanese history to begin with ."
3903,"Throughout his life , he maintained his tough Hakka spirit and academic independence , holding fast to his opinions and never compromising ."
3904,He was greatly admired for his intellectual integrity .
3905,These great masters ' deaths have come at a time when the field of education has been in the spotlight for other reasons .
3906,"The Ministry of Education has just formally apologized - 50 years after the fact - for the April 6 Incident , and a university president has been found guilty of plagiarizing a research paper ."
3907,The former shows that intellectuals in Taiwan need no longer fear torture and imprisonment for their beliefs .
3908,The latter suggests that some people have allowed blind ambition to sully the pure ideal of scholarship .
3909,"Apart from causing us to mourn , the deaths of these great men have left us with a lot to think about ."
3910,p. 62
3911,Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music .
3912,His major opera on Zheng Chenggong -LRB- Koxinga -RRB- debuted just last year .
3913,"The most important Taiwanese musical master of the last half century , he was a beloved teacher to many ."
3914,His legacy will live on through his students .

3922,""" Only with a true understanding of history can we clearly chart a future path ! """
3923,What people respected most about the historian Tai Kuo-hui was his determination to face historical truth and his refusal to heed prevailing dogma and political fashion .

3929,"The Bible says : "" If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ' Move hence to yonder place , ' and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you . """
3930,"For small as the mustard seed is , it grows into a mighty , spreading tree ."
3931,"Applying these words to Taiwan , they most aptly describe the Taiwan red cypress , whose tiny seeds are the origin of Taiwan 's greatest trees ."
3932,"From conelets three millimeters in diameter come seeds no larger than sesame seeds , yet they grow into huge trees up to 60 meters tall ."
3933,"The Taiwan red cypress witnessed Taiwan 's birth , squeezed up by the collision of two tectonic plates , and its progress from a fragile mass of broken rock to a more stable geology ."
3934,It has also witnessed the rise and fall of Taiwan 's forestry industry .
3935,"Hsiuluan Village , an Atayal community in eastern Hsinchu County , was one of the last places in Taiwan to be reached by modern civilization , and was once famous as the "" village without lights . """
3936,"In the mountain forest above Hsiuluan 's outlying hamlet of Chenhsipao , bushes and creepers form a dense undergrowth , and a blanket of damp fallen leaves makes the going slippery underfoot ."
3937,"Every ten to 20 meters , a magnificent Taiwan red cypress , thousands of years old and with a trunk three to four meters thick , towers 40 meters into the sky ."
3938,"Awe - stricken hikers standing below these great trees have the impression of having fallen into a sea of jungle , from which they can barely see the sky ."
3939,This remnant of virgin cypress forest runs northward to Taoyuan County 's Mt. Lala and to Chilan in Ilan County .
3940,"This great wall of trees acts as a vital "" safety valve , "" regulating the flow of water into the Shihmen Reservoir , the Tanshui River and the Lanyang River , on which millions of people in northern Taiwan depend for the water they drink ."
3941,"The coat of green which clothes the mountains intimately affects water quality and soil stability in Taoyuan , Hsinchu , Miaoli and Ilan Counties ."
3942,A land of clouds and mists
3943,"Taiwan 's "" false cypresses "" - trees of the genus Chamaecyparis , a subdivision of the cypress family , Cupressaceae - are relics of the ice ages which brought them to our geologically young island ."
3944,"Thirty million years ago , Chamaecyparis species were distributed all over the world ."
3945,"But after the ice ages , the high mountains of Taiwan , which were squeezed up from the edges of two tectonic plates a million years ago , became their refuge ."
3946,"Today , only six false cypress species remain anywhere in the world , scattered far apart in North America , Japan and Taiwan ."
3947,"Two of them are native to Taiwan : the Taiwan red cypress -LRB- Chamaecyparis formosensis , a.k.a. the Formosan cypress -RRB- and the Taiwan yellow cypress -LRB- Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana , a variety of hinoki cypress -RRB- ."
3948,"The home of Taiwan 's false cypresses is at medium elevations from 1,300 to 2,600 meters , which is Taiwan 's area of greatest precipitation and a major source of water for over 100 rivers ."
3949,"At these elevations there is much rainfall but relatively little wind , and the mountains are shrouded in clouds and mists all year round ; hence the forests there are also known as cloud forests ."
3950,"In this environment of constant humidity , the Taiwan red cypress grew into East Asia 's biggest conifer , with average heights from 30 to 40 meters ."
3951,The cypress forests also mark the transition between Taiwan 's broadleaved and coniferous forests .
3952,"False cypresses make up more than 70 % of the trees in this zone , but they are accompanied by a rich variety of other plants , including other big trees like Formosan taiwania -LRB- Taiwania cryptomerioides -RRB- , Formosan cunninghamia -LRB- Cunninghamia konishii -RRB- and Chinese yew -LRB- Taxus mairei -RRB- ."
3953,"Hidden in the dark , damp understorey are a third of Taiwan 's fern species , and the millennia - old false cypresses are also a paradise for epiphytic plants - as many as 80 species have been found growing on a single tree ."
3954,Taiwan 's Earth God
3955,"The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest ."
3956,"In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth ."
3957,"Professor Chen Yu - feng of Providence University , who has been studying Taiwan 's flora for many years , explains that false cypress forests often grew where river erosion created large areas of debris from rockslides ."
3958,"As tectonic forces pushed Taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places ."
3959,Doughty false cypress seeds seized the opportunity to colonize this hostile territory shunned by other plants .
3960,"There they gradually grew into gigantic trees , rehabilitating the land and attracting other species ."
3961,"At the same time they protected downstream areas , making them suitable for settlement and farming ."
3962,""" The growth of the cypress forests stabilized the rubble brought down by the rushing mountain rivers ."
3963,"The false cypresses are living ' spirits ' which naturally restore the land , "" says Chen Yu - feng ."
3964,"For the past million years , clouds rolling in on northeasterly monsoon fronts in winter and southwesterly airflows in summer have carried their moisture into the mountain valleys , to slowly condense onto the slopes where the false cypresses grow ."
3965,"Steeped in this dampness , the flora and fauna of the forest continued an unending cycle of growth and renewal through the changing seasons ."
3966,The only humans who entered there were the aboriginal people who came to hunt and to collect wild fruit and berries .
3967,"Every few decades the shaking of the earth would ravage this ecosystem , but protected by the vitality of the cypresses the land would gradually recover ."
3968,The nemesis of the cypress trees
3969,"However , the advent of mechanization , coupled with human greed , heralded a period of rapacious exploitation ."
3970,In the 19th century human beings swarmed into Taiwan 's dark mountains like busy worker ants .
3971,"The false cypresses , which had conversed with the clouds for a million years , were identified as top - grade timber , and were thus condemned to an inexorable fate ."
3972,"After Taiwan was ceded to Japan following the Sino - Japanese war of 1894 , while the Japanese were still quelling resistance to their rule they also went into the island 's mountains to collect botanical specimens ."
3973,"In 1896 , a Japanese biologist collected the first specimen of Taiwan red cypress on Yushan , and before long the Taiwan yellow cypress was found there too ."
3974,"In 1899 , the great cypress forests of Mt. Ali were discovered , and in 1912 , the Japanese colonial government began large - scale logging there ."
3975,Everywhere the Alishan Mountain Railway passes at higher elevations was once cypress forest .
3976,Soon afterwards the forests of Mt. Taiping in modern Ilan County and Mt. Pahsien in Nantou were also opened up for logging .
3977,"Endless streams of cypress logs flowed out of the mountains , and were carried across the sea to Japan to become pillars for Shinto shrines ."
3978,"Quite apart from the incomparable quality of their timber , in terms of numbers alone the Taiwan red and yellow cypress took second and third place among Taiwan 's trees , so they became long - term cash cows for the island 's forestry industry ."
3979,"After Taiwan 's return to Chinese rule , from the 1950s to the 1980s the ROC used forestry income to support its industrial development ."
3980,"The logging grounds advanced deep into Taiwan 's heart , consuming even greater areas than under the Japanese ."
3981,"False cypresses accounted for two - thirds of the 300,000 hectares of commercial forest , and contributed 70 - 80 % of forestry income ."
3982,All of Taiwan 's forest recreation areas today are to be found in the former cypress logging grounds .
3983,"The Alishan Mountain Railway , and the long forestry roads which wind through Taiwan 's four major mountain ranges , were all built for the sole purpose of shifting the huge cypress logs down the slopes ."
3984,""" You could say that everything connected with Taiwan 's forestry industry developed around the false cypresses , "" says forest ecologist Yang Kuo - chen , an associate professor at Providence University ."
3985,"The history of forestry in Taiwan is a history of false cypress felling , says Yang ."
3986,Hinoki and merihi
3987,"If you speak of "" hinoki , "" the Japanese name of the Taiwan yellow cypress , older Taiwanese will lift their noses as if catching a whiff of its unmistakable fragrance - it has a firm place in their memories as the best of timbers ."
3988,The Taiwan yellow and red cypress each have their own different qualities .
3989,"The Taiwan yellow cypress grows pencil - straight towards the heavens , and has a higher content of oil , from which a fragrant essence can be refined ."
3990,"In 1971 , after the Shinto gate at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo was struck by lightning , the Japanese authorities especially came to Taiwan to buy 11 huge , straight Taiwan yellow cypress logs 16 to 24 meters long , cut from trees over 1,500 years old , to create the world 's biggest Shinto gate ."
3991,As for the Taiwan red cypress - merihi in Japanese - it is even more magnificent in appearance than the Taiwan yellow cypress .
3992,"But the Taiwan red cypress 's trunk is often divided , and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria , producing strangely tangled hollow trees ."
3993,The crown is also broad and difficult to cut .
3994,"This is why the gigantic ancient trees that have escaped the loggers ' chainsaws , such as those at Mt. Ali and Mt. Lala , are all Taiwan red cypress ."
3995,"Human life is fleeting , but cypress is forever ."
3996,"As the forestry industry gradually declined , the forestry huts built in the Central Range in the Japanese period fell into disrepair , but their cypress - wood washbasins are still as good as new ."
3997,"The close grain of their growth rings reveals their age , and their resilience ."
3998,"In the early days , the sleepers used for the Alishan Mountain Railway were cut from broadleaved trees such as beech and Michelia compressa ."
3999,"But tough as these woods are , the sleepers only stood up to three to five years of logging trains rumbling over them , so there was no choice but to change them all for sleepers made of false cypress wood , which lasted for decades ."
4000,"And when the railways were finally taken out of service , the Taiwan Forestry Bureau -LRB- TFB -RRB- sold off the old sleepers , and from the proceeds not only was able to recoup the cost of dismantling the railways , but was also left with a tidy sum for its own coffers ."
4001,"For the older generation , the excellence of false cypress wood is hard to put into words ."
4002,"Old folk to this day still rattle on about how the cypress - wood sleeping platforms of Japanese - style houses were long - lasting and hard - wearing , and how the best bathtubs were of course those of made of false cypress wood ."
4003,"In the eyes of furniture makers , "" False cypress wood is light and easy to work ; it is flexible , rotproof and termite resistant ."
4004,"It rarely warps , and hardly shrinks ; it planes to a smooth , fine surface ."
4005,"It 's so versatile : boats , bridges , carriages , cabinets or coffins - there 's not one it 's not suitable for . """
4006,"In short , of all Taiwan 's commercial timbers , there 's not another to match it ."
4007,Pining away
4008,"However , behind these sweet memories of cypress wood are the regrets of the foresters ."
4009,"Surveys made before logging began at Mt. Ali , Taiwan 's earliest cypress logging area , showed that there were more than 300,000 false cypresses over 1,000 years old , but today all that remains of them is a few lonely - looking old trees scattered among introduced Japanese red cedar -LRB- Cryptomeria japonica -RRB- and flowering cherries ."
4010,"Despite its great fame , deprived of the company of its own species the most celebrated of the giant Taiwan red cypresses of Mt. Ali finally succumbed to lightning and fire ."
4011,"The TFB once hoped that if a few false cypresses were left standing in each of the old logging areas , they would seed naturally ."
4012,"But they discovered that although the trees were completely uninjured , they died one by one ."
4013,"Late Taiwanese forestry expert Liu Chin described these few remaining trees as "" dying of loneliness . """
4014,"It seems that when abandoned by the companions they had relied on for millennia , and left to face the rigors of their environment alone , these ancient survivors went into terminal decline ."
4015,"But an even greater cause for regret is that "" 50 years of intensive false cypress logging tore the heart out of Taiwan 's life - support system ."
4016,"This devastation , coupled with agriculture moving up into the mountains , can only result in landslides , floods and all kinds of ' natural ' disasters . . . . """
4017,"With ecologists ' warnings ringing in their ears , now that floods and mudslides have become a common occurrence , people can only nod in tacit agreement ."
4018,Large - scale logging of false cypresses continued right up to 1989 .
4019,"With forestry earning no profits , and in response to energetic lobbying by civic groups , the Executive Yuan finally banned the cutting of natural forests , at last giving a respite to the giant trees which protect Taiwan 's land ."
4020,But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached .
4021,"Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt. Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000 - plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt. Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees ."
4022,Whose national park ?
4023,"Humans cut down the million year - old cypress forests in less than a century , but the story of their destruction is not over ."
4024,"Amazingly , the ban on logging natural forests has not protected Chilan , the only single - species forest of hinoki cypress surviving in the world today ."
4025,"Before the ban , the Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen -LRB- VACRS -RRB- , which manages Chilan , had already cut down almost 6,000 hectares ."
4026,"To generate income , VACRS has continued logging there under the pretext of "" clearing away dead and fallen trees to make space for young trees to grow . """
4027,Ecologists and biologists can only repeat again :
4028,""" The trees have been growing by themselves for tens of thousands of years , so why would they need human help for their saplings to grow ? """
4029,"In response to this situation a popular movement sprang up to push for the establishment of a "" cypress forest national park , "" in the hope that with national park status , the last remaining virgin Taiwan yellow cypress forest could be saved ."
4030,"Perhaps the millennium year was a decisive one for the trees , for the Executive Yuan allocated new funds to the VACRS so that it no longer needs to cut down trees to bolster its finances , and also approved a plan to set up a national park ."
4031,But so - called ecotourism is now emerging as another threat to the trees ' survival .
4032,"To assure the livelihood of the local Atayal aborigines of Chilan , when the cypress national park is set up consideration will have to be given to how to balance the need to protect the forests with the demand for sustainable tourism ."
4033,How can Taiwan 's false cypresses become more than just a tool of human economic activity ?
4034,Can the sad history of cypress logging teach the people of Taiwan a lesson in how to truly care for their land ?
4035,Perhaps these questions are still more important than the issue of establishing a national park .
4036,A future for the cypresses ?
4037,"At the Atayal village of Chenhsipao in Hsinchu County , by three in the afternoon the clouds rolling in from afar have quietly slipped over the ridges and covered the whole mountainside where the cypress trees grow ."
4038,"Here , in Taiwan 's remote but vitally important heartland , gigantic trees which have survived the long river of time and escaped the ravages of logging stand undaunted , like guardian spirits quietly protecting the Atayal people and Taiwan 's land ."
4039,"Only if we can allow the cypress trees a future , will the people of Taiwan also have a lasting future ."

4050,This Taiwan red cypress planted by the Japanese at Mt. Ali in 1915 has now reached a girth of 70 centimeters .
4051,But the smallest commercial size of Taiwan red cypress is 150 centimeters .
4052,This means that artificially planted trees are not ready for harvest until they are 300 years old .
4053,"Hence since the false cypress forests were cleared , Taiwanese - preferring quick profits - have generally planted Japanese red cedar , which is ready to be felled after only 20 years ."

4123,Everything that Abbas ' government says about the economic blockade is completely correct and true .
4124,"It is an oppressive blockade that punishes the Palestinian people for their democratic choice and is based on double standards , all this is perfectly true , but what is the point of continuing to denounce and condemn this oppressive blockade a thousand million times without trying , even once for the sake of God and the country , to find an exit or solution to this crisis , even if the matter requires us to step down a little from the seats of power which are , in essence , no more than an autonomous authority under the hegemony of direct Israeli military occupation , and in the light of the Western sponsor countries ' pre-set conditions . ."

4216,"A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported ."
4217,"The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said ."
4218,"Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York - based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 ."
4219,"Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem ."
4220,"A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story ."
4221,We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
4222,There is no asbestos in our products now . ''
4223,Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
4224,"`` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute ."
4225,Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
4226,The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 .
4227,"From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said ."
4228,"Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number ."
4229,"Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer ."
4230,"The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said ."
4231,"`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , '' said Dr. Talcott ."
4232,"The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said ."
4233,"The plant , which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters ."
4234,"The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said ."
4235,"The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine ."
4236,"More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained ."
4237,"In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos ."
4238,"By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed ."
4239,About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s .
4240,Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .
4241,"Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters ."
4242,"Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area ."
4243,"`` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases , '' said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose ."
4244,`` But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
4245,It has no bearing on our work force today .
4246,"Yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates ."
4247,The average seven - day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC 's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .
4248,Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
4249,"Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to Donoghue 's ."
4250,Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
4251,Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
4252,"The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days ."
4253,"Nevertheless , said Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short - term interest rates ."
4254,"The yield on six - month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % ."
4255,"Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds ."
4256,"Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion ."
4257,"Typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates ."
4258,The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .
4259,"Dreyfus World - Wide Dollar , the top - yielding fund , had a seven - day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier ."
4260,"It invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield ."
4261,"The average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % ."
4262,The 30 - day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30 - day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .

4270,The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt .
4271,"Until Congress acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the Treasury said ."
4272,The government 's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $ 2.80 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion .
4273,Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes .
4274,"The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the Senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest ."
4275,The Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress does n't act by then .

4282,The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting .
4283,And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
4284,"The idea , of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand ."
4285,"On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory ."
4286,"For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist - comedian Victor Borge ."
4287,Champagne and dessert followed .
4288,"The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , unimpeded by traffic or red lights ."
4289,"The governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests ."
4290,"A buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors ."
4291,"Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10 - lap exhibition race ."
4292,"After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers ."
4293,"No dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two ."
4294,"Back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again ."
4295,"This time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away ."
4296,"Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce ."
4297,"Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation ."
4298,More than a few CEOs say the red - carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings .
4299,"But for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February ."
4300,"South Korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in October , reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released Wednesday ."
4301,"Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on South Korea 's export - oriented economy ."
4302,"Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion , up 20 % from last October ."
4303,"South Korea 's economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports ."
4304,Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .
4305,"Despite the gloomy forecast , South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year ."

4308,"Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers ."
4309,"The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years ."
4310,"Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report ."
4311,"Alan Spoon , recently named Newsweek president , said Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January ."
4312,"A full , four - color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 ."
4313,"In mid-October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 ."
4314,U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates .
4315,"Newsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , which awards space credits to advertisers on `` renewal advertising . ''"
4316,"The magazine will reward with `` page bonuses '' advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending , as long as they spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990 ."
4317,"Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; Newsweek 's ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 % from last year , according to Publishers Information Bureau ."
4318,"`` What matters is what advertisers are paying per page , and in that department we are doing fine this fall , '' said Mr. Spoon ."
4319,"Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches ."
4320,"However , none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently ."
4321,"According to Audit Bureau of Circulations , Time , the largest newsweekly , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % ."
4322,"Newsweek 's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 , flat from the same period last year ."

4326,"Japan 's domestic sales of cars , trucks and buses in October rose 18 % from a year earlier to 500,004 units , a record for the month , the Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association said ."
4327,The strong growth followed year - to - year increases of 21 % in August and 12 % in September .
4328,The monthly sales have been setting records every month since March .
4329,"October sales , compared with the previous month , inched down 0.4 % ."
4330,"Sales of passenger cars grew 22 % from a year earlier to 361,376 units ."
4331,"Sales of medium - sized cars , which benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax , more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988 ."
4332,"Texas Instruments Japan Ltd. , a unit of Texas Instruments Inc. , said it opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices ."

4334,The plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances .
4335,"John R. Stevens , 49 years old , was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer , both new positions ."

4337,Mr. Stevens was executive vice president of this electric - utility holding company .

4344,"The U.S. , claiming some success in its trade diplomacy , removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and other intellectual - property rights ."
4345,"However , five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so - called priority watch list as a result of an interim review , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced ."
4346,"Under the new U.S. trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair - trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring ."
4347,Mrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made `` genuine progress '' on this touchy issue .
4348,"She said there is `` growing realization '' around the world that denial of intellectual - property rights harms all trading nations , and particularly the `` creativity and inventiveness of an -LCB- offending -RCB- country 's own citizens . ''"
4349,U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual - property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high - technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there .
4350,Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual - property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates .
4351,"Seoul also has instituted effective search - and - seizure procedures to aid these teams , she said ."
4352,"Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films ."
4353,That measure could compel Taipei 's growing number of small video - viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films .
4354,"Saudi Arabia , for its part , has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works , Mrs. Hills said ."
4355,"These three countries are n't completely off the hook , though ."
4356,They will remain on a lower - priority list that includes 17 other countries .
4357,"Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less - serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority '' list ."
4358,"Gary Hoffman , a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual - property cases , said the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia ."
4359,"`` What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working , '' he said ."
4360,He said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law .
4361,Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about `` disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia . ''
4362,"She did n't elaborate , although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey ."
4363,The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30 .
4364,"So far , Mrs. Hills has n't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so - called special 301 provision of the act ."
4365,Argentina said it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $ 64 billion -- the third - highest in the developing world .
4366,The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature .
4367,The Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year .
4368,"`` Argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50 % in the value of its external debt , '' Mr. Rapanelli said through his spokesman , Miguel Alurralde ."
4369,Mr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford .
4370,Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week to meet with banks .
4371,"Mr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem , who took office July 8 , feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved ."
4372,But he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven .

4374,THREE COMPUTERS THAT CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in 1977 .
4375,"That year the Apple II , Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS - 80 came to market ."
4376,The computers were crude by today 's standards .
4377,"Apple II owners , for example , had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes ."
4378,"But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I , which was built in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club ."
4379,"In addition , the Apple II was an affordable $ 1,298 ."
4380,"Crude as they were , these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office ."
4381,Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years .
4382,"But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built - from - kit types such as the Altair , Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories ."
4383,Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts .
4384,There were many pioneer PC contributors .
4385,"William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language - housekeeper system for PCs , and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981 ."
4386,"Alan F. Shugart , currently chairman of Seagate Technology , led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs ."
4387,"Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington , two Atlanta engineers , were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone ."
4388,"IBM , the world leader in computers , did n't offer its first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market ."
4389,"Today , PC shipments annually total some $ 38.3 billion world - wide ."
4390,"F.H. Faulding & Co. , an Australian pharmaceuticals company , said its Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $ 23 million ."
4391,Kalipharma is a New Jersey - based pharmaceuticals concern that sells products under the Purepac label .
4392,Faulding said it owns 33 % of Moleculon 's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19 % .
4393,"That stake , together with its convertible preferred stock holdings , gives Faulding the right to increase its interest to 70 % of Moleculon 's voting stock ."
4394,"Oil production from Australia 's Bass Strait fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field , the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990 ."
4395,"Esso Australia Ltd. , a unit of New York - based Exxon Corp. , and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture ."
4396,Esso said the Whiting field started production Tuesday .
4397,"Output will be gradually increased until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day ."
4398,The field has reserves of 21 million barrels .
4399,Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels .
4400,"The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected to start producing early next year , and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year ."
4401,Esso said the fields were developed after the Australian government decided in 1987 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax .
4402,"R.P. Scherer Corp. said it completed the $ 10.2 million sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led by the unit 's president , Thomas R. Sloan , and other managers ."
4403,"Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy - out group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year , the maker of gelatin capsules decided to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses ."
4404,The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program .

4406,"Japanese investors nearly single - handedly bought up two new mortgage securities - based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million , the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said ."
4407,"The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage - based instruments , Fannie Mae 's chairman , David O. Maxwell , said at a news conference ."
4408,He said more than 90 % of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors .
4409,The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong .
4410,"Earlier this year , Japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million mortgage - backed securities mutual fund ."
4411,"That fund was put together by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank ."
4412,"The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co ."
4413,"The new , seven - year funds -- one offering a fixed - rate return and the other with a floating - rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors ."
4414,"First , they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage - backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates ."
4415,"Second , they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments , reducing the administrative burden on investors ."
4416,"By addressing those problems , Mr. Maxwell said , the new funds have become `` extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. . ''"
4417,"Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage - backed securities to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate ."

4422,"Japan 's reserves of gold , convertible foreign currencies , and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ 1.82 billion in October to $ 84.29 billion , the Finance Ministry said ."
4423,The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline .
4424,"The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen - support intervention since June , when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level ."
4425,The announcement follows a sharper $ 2.2 billion decline in the country 's foreign reserves in September to $ 86.12 billion .
4426,"Pick a country , any country ."
4427,"It 's the latest investment craze sweeping Wall Street : a rash of new closed - end country funds , those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country ."
4428,"No fewer than 24 country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year , triple the level of all of 1988 , according to Charles E. Simon & Co. , a Washington - based research firm ."
4429,The turf recently has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal .
4430,"Next week , the Philippine Fund 's launch will be capped by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here ."
4431,The next province ?
4432,"`` Anything 's possible -- how about the New Guinea Fund ? '' quips George Foot , a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton , Mass ."
4433,"The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the `` closed - end fund mania '' of the 1920s , Mr. Foot says , when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular ."
4434,They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash .
4435,"Unlike traditional open - end mutual funds , most of these one - country portfolios are the `` closed - end '' type , issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly ."
4436,The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London .
4437,These funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets .
4438,"`` People are looking to stake their claims '' now before the number of available nations runs out , says Michael Porter , an analyst at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , New York ."
4439,Behind all the hoopla is some heavy - duty competition .
4440,"As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years , securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell ."
4441,And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it .
4442,Financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities .
4443,"And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets , such as the U.S. and Japan ."
4444,Country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies .
4445,But it does n't take much to get burned .
4446,Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds .
4447,Another concern : The funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market .
4448,"When the stock market dropped nearly 7 % Oct. 13 , for instance , the Mexico Fund plunged about 18 % and the Spain Fund fell 16 % ."
4449,And most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash .
4450,What 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios .
4451,"After trading at an average discount of more than 20 % in late 1987 and part of last year , country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6 % ."
4452,The reason : Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold .
4453,"It 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors , such as South Korea , some specialists say ."
4454,But some European funds recently have skyrocketed ; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium .
4455,It has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long - term play tied to 1992 's European economic integration .
4456,And several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums .
4457,"`` I 'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations , '' says Smith Barney 's Mr. Porter ."
4458,"The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds , Mr. Porter suggests ."
4459,"Unlike many U.S. investors , those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign - stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds ."
4460,"`` There may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here , '' Mr. Porter says ."
4461,"Nonetheless , plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds ."
4462,They argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds ; these so - called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U.S. .
4463,That way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium .
4464,"For people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds , Newgate 's Mr. Foot says : `` The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly ."
4465,"The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $ 188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government , the State Department said ."
4466,"If the debts are repaid , it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S. ."
4467,"However , after two meetings with the Soviets , a State Department spokesman said that it 's `` too early to say '' whether that will happen ."
4468,"Coincident with the talks , the State Department said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch ."
4469,The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July .
4470,"But a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the $ 188 million debt , which was lent to the country 's short - lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917 ."
4471,"Under a 1934 law , the Johnson Debt Default Act , as amended , it 's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government , unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund ."
4472,The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization .
4473,Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value .
4474,The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act .
4475,But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend - lease program .
4476,"In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September ."
4477,"Meanwhile , the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month ."
4478,Its index inched up to 47.6 % in October from 46 % in September .
4479,Any reading below 50 % suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining .
4480,"The purchasing managers , however , also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline ."
4481,"Factories booked $ 236.74 billion in orders in September , nearly the same as the $ 236.79 billion in August , the Commerce Department said ."
4482,"If not for a 59.6 % surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders would have fallen 2.1 % ."
4483,"In a separate report , the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ 415.6 billion , not significantly different from the $ 415.8 billion reported for August ."
4484,"Private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up ."
4485,"The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns , but were n't adjusted for inflation ."
4486,"Kenneth Mayland , economist for Society Corp. , a Cleveland bank , said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off ."
4487,"At the same time , the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry ."
4488,`` What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack ? '' he asked .
4489,`` I draw a blank . ''
4490,"By most measures , the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all ."
4491,Factory payrolls fell in September .
4492,So did the Federal Reserve Board 's industrial - production index .
4493,Yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession .
4494,They cite a lack of `` imbalances '' that provide early warning signals of a downturn .
4495,"Inventories are closely watched for such clues , for instance ."
4496,Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession .
4497,"But yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front : it said factory inventories fell 0.1 % in September , the first decline since February 1987 ."
4498,"`` This conforms to the ` soft landing ' scenario , '' said Elliott Platt , an economist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp ."
4499,`` I do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . ''
4500,A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession .
4501,The department said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion after climbing 0.9 % the month before .
4502,Orders for durable goods were up 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion after rising 3.9 % the month before .
4503,The department previously estimated that durable - goods orders fell 0.1 % in September .
4504,Factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 234.4 billion after rising 5.4 % in August .
4505,"Shipments have been relatively level since January , the Commerce Department noted ."
4506,"Manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5 % in September to $ 497.34 billion , helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector ."
4507,"Excluding these orders , backlogs declined 0.3 % ."
4508,"In its construction spending report , the Commerce Department said residential construction , which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending , was off 0.9 % in September to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion ."
4509,"David Berson , economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association , predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single - family homes , but probably not until early next year ."
4510,"Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion with no sector showing strength ."
4511,Government construction spending rose 4.3 % to $ 88 billion .
4512,"After adjusting for inflation , the Commerce Department said construction spending did n't change in September ."
4513,"For the first nine months of the year , total construction spending ran about 2 % above last year 's level ."
4514,The government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGraw - Hill Inc. 's F.W. Dodge Group .
4515,Dodge reported an 8 % increase in construction contracts awarded in September .
4516,The goverment counts money as it is spent ; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded .
4517,The government includes money spent on residential renovation ; Dodge does n't .
4518,"Although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession , said Robert Bretz , chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. , Stamford , Conn ."
4519,He said the index would have to be in the low 40 % range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession .
4520,"The report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth , though still continuing , may be slowing ."
4521,"Only 19 % of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October , down from 27 % in September ."
4522,"And 8 % said export orders were down last month , compared with 6 % the month before ."
4523,The purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control .
4524,"For the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell ."
4525,The decline was even steeper than in September .
4526,They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months .
4527,Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating .
4528,"When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise ."
4529,The purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives .
4530,Each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening .
4531,"For the first time , the October survey polled members on imports ."
4532,"It found that of the 73 % who import , 10 % said they imported more in October and 12 % said they imported less than the previous month ."
4533,"While acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. Bretz said , `` It does lead you to suspect imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much . ''"
4534,"Items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen , but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder ."
4535,"`` It 's an odd thing to put on the list , '' Mr. Bretz noted ."
4536,"He said that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk ."
4537,"They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk , coupled with very low import quotas ."

4541,"Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami 's `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' -LRB- Kodansha , 320 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common ."
4542,"Although set in Japan , the novel 's texture is almost entirely Western , especially American ."
4543,"Characters drink Salty Dogs , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns ."
4544,They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo .
4545,"They worry about their careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs ."
4546,This is Japan ?
4547,"For an American reader , part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan is n't the buttoned - down society of contemporary American lore ."
4548,"It 's also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly does n't belong to the self - aggrandizing `` we - Japanese '' school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders ."
4549,"If `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think ."
4550,That 's not to say that the nutty plot of `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' is rooted in reality .
4551,It 's imaginative and often funny .
4552,"A disaffected , hard - drinking , nearly - 30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree ."
4553,"He has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly ."
4554,"Along the way , he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God 's phone number ; and the Sheep Man , a sweet , roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin ."
4555,The 40 - year - old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan .
4556,"A more recent novel , `` Norwegian Wood '' -LRB- every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics -RRB- , has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987 ."
4557,But he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo 's brat pack -- who are dominating the best - seller charts in Japan .
4558,"Their books are written in idiomatic , contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana ."
4559,"In Robert Whiting 's `` You Gotta Have Wa '' -LRB- Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , the Beatles give way to baseball , in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a `` game . ''"
4560,"As Mr. Whiting describes it , Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''"
4561,`` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it .
4562,A player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average .
4563,"Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , '' as the male symbol of Japan ."
4564,"But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , for example , must always wear ties when on the road ."
4565,"`` You Gotta Have Wa '' is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers , rationed to two per team , fare in Japan ."
4566,"Despite the enormous sums of money they 're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate , a good number decide it 's not worth it and run for home ."
4567,"`` Funny Business '' -LRB- Soho , 228 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- by Gary Katzenstein is anything but ."
4568,It 's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties .
4569,"In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker ."
4570,Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark .
4571,"It 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that Sony was chary of letting a young , short - term American employee take on any responsibility ."
4572,"All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein , who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman ."
4573,"But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein , after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita , founder of Sony ."
4574,It 's a shame their meeting never took place .
4575,"Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something , and it 's even possible Mr. Morita would have too ."
4576,"Ms. Kirkpatrick , the Journal 's deputy editorial features editor , worked in Tokyo for three years ."
4577,More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke .
4578,"In Singapore , a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before entering restaurants , department stores and sports centers or face a $ 250 fine ."
4579,"Discos and private clubs are exempt from the ban , and smoking will be permitted in bars except during meal hours , an official said ."
4580,"Singapore already bans smoking in all theaters , buses , public elevators , hospitals and fast - food restaurants ."
4581,"In Malaysia , Siti Zaharah Sulaiman , a deputy minister in the prime minister 's office , launched a `` No - Smoking Week '' at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools to ban on - campus smoking ."
4582,South Korea has different concerns .
4583,"In Seoul , officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes ."
4584,South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places .
4585,A marketing study indicates that Hong Kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out .
4586,"The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony 's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets , which include the U.S. and Japan ."
4587,"The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values , compared with about one - third in Japan and the U.S. ."
4588,"More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan ."
4589,The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu 's proposal to build a $ 19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now .
4590,"The meeting , which is expected to draw 20,000 to Bangkok , was going to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel , but the government balked at the hotel 's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion ."
4591,A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built in such a short time .
4592,"Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee asking him to back a Palestinian bid to join the committee , the Palestine Liberation Organization news agency WAFA said ."
4593,An official of the Palestinian Olympic Committee said the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year .
4594,The PLO in recent months has been trying to join international organizations but failed earlier this year to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization .
4595,"A Beijing food - shop assistant has become the first mainland Chinese to get AIDS through sex , the People 's Daily said ."

4597,"Once the disease was confirmed , all the man 's associates and family were tested , but none have so far been found to have AIDS , the newspaper said ."
4598,"The man had for a long time had `` a chaotic sex life , '' including relations with foreign men , the newspaper said ."
4599,The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150 % and doubled gas prices .
4600,The official news agency PAP said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices .
4601,"In happier news , South Korea , in establishing diplomatic ties with Poland yesterday , announced $ 450 million in loans to the financially strapped Warsaw government ."
4602,"In a victory for environmentalists , Hungary 's parliament terminated a multibillion - dollar River Danube dam being built by Austrian firms ."
4603,"The Nagymaros dam was designed to be twinned with another dam , now nearly complete , 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia ."
4604,"In ending Hungary 's part of the project , Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia , which still wants the dam to be built ."
4605,Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned .
4606,Czechoslovakia said in May it could seek $ 2 billion from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken .
4607,The Czech dam ca n't be operated solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project .

4610,"After years of decline , weddings in France showed a 2.2 % upturn last year , with 6,000 more couples exchanging rings in 1988 than in the previous year , the national statistics office said ."
4611,"But the number of weddings last year -- 271,124 -- was still well below the 400,000 registered in 1972 , the last year of increasing marriages ."
4612,"BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 85.1 million -RRB- of 10.5 % senior debentures due Nov. 30 , 1999 , together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants ."
4613,"The Toronto - based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$ 1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase ."
4614,"The warrants expire Nov. 30 , 1990 ."
4615,The issue will be swapped into fixed - rate U.S. dollars at a rate the company said is less than 9 % ; a spokesman declined to elaborate .
4616,"Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. , both Toronto - based investment dealers ."
4617,Bramalea said it expects to complete the issue by the end of the month .
4618,"As an actor , Charles Lane is n't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin 's spirit ."
4619,Steve Martin has already laid his claim to that .
4620,"But it is Mr. Lane , as movie director , producer and writer , who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin 's Little Tramp in a contemporary way ."
4621,"In 1976 , as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York , Mr. Lane shot `` A Place in Time , '' a 36 - minute black - and - white film about a sketch artist , a man of the streets ."
4622,"Now , 13 years later , Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full - length movie called `` Sidewalk Stories , '' a poignant piece of work about a modern - day tramp ."
4623,"Of course , if the film contained dialogue , Mr. Lane 's Artist would be called a homeless person ."
4624,"So would the Little Tramp , for that matter ."
4625,I say `` contained dialogue '' because `` Sidewalk Stories '' is n't really silent at all .
4626,"Composer Marc Marder , a college friend of Mr. Lane 's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would ."
4627,Much of Mr. Lane 's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets -LRB- though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin 's notion of the Tramp as the good - hearted free spirit -RRB- .
4628,"Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill , the New York streets of `` Sidewalk Stories '' seem benign ."
4629,"On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs ."
4630,"The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village , on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers , magicians and other good - natured hustlers ."
4631,"-LRB- This clearly is not real life : no crack dealers , no dead - eyed men selling four - year - old copies of Cosmopolitan , no one curled up in a cardboard box . -RRB-"
4632,The Artist has his routine .
4633,"He spends his days sketching passers - by , or trying to ."
4634,At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home .
4635,"His life , including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist , seems carefree ."
4636,He is his own man .
4637,"Then , just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in `` City Lights , '' the Artist is put in charge of returning a two - year - old waif -LRB- Nicole Alysia -RRB- , whose father has been murdered by thugs , to her mother ."
4638,This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse .
4639,"She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life ."
4640,The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night .
4641,"To further load the stakes , Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman who owns her own children 's shop and who lives in an expensive high - rise apartment building ."
4642,This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it .
4643,Mr. Lane 's final purpose is n't to glamorize the Artist 's vagabond existence .
4644,"He has a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force ."
4645,"The movie ends with sound , the sound of street people talking , and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices ."
4646,The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his `` Story of Women . ''
4647,"He has made a harsh , brilliant picture -- one that 's captivating -- about a character who , viewed from the most sympathetic angle , would seem disagreeable ."
4648,"Yet this woman , Marie - Louise Giraud , carries historical significance , both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government 's hypocrisy ."
4649,"While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews , its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor ."
4650,"Marie - Louise , a small - time abortionist , was their woman ."
4651,"She became an abortionist accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war - rationed goodies ."
4652,"She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client ."
4653,Her remorse was shallow and brief .
4654,"Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war - damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home ."
4655,"As presented by Mr. Chabrol , and played with thin - lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert , Marie - Louise -LRB- called Marie Latour in the film -RRB- was not a nice person ."
4656,But she did n't deserve to have her head chopped off .
4657,"There is very little to recommend `` Old Gringo , '' a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution ."
4658,Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory .
4659,"I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has Gregory Peck , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die ."

4661,Boeing Co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin - jet .
4662,"The discussions are still in preliminary stages , and the specific details have n't been worked out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. , Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd ."
4663,"The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767 , accounting for a combined 15 % of the aircraft ."
4664,Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20 % and 25 % under the new program .
4665,"If Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767 , the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s ."
4666,"This is the year the negative ad , for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns , became the main event ."
4667,"The irony is that the attack commercial , after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign , has come of age in an off - off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country ."
4668,"But in the three leading political contests of 1989 , the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility , raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content ."
4669,"`` Now , '' says Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television , `` the idea is to attack first , last and always . ''"
4670,"A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes - tawdry art form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage ."
4671,"`` To get people 's attention these days , '' says Douglas Bailey , a political consultant , `` your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational ."
4672,"And , unlike a few years ago , you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful . ''"
4673,"In 1989 , as often as not , the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves ."
4674,"Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in New York City , New Jersey and Virginia :"
4675,New York City :
4676,"The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City ."
4677,"`` David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years , '' says a disembodied male voice ."
4678,"And then this television commercial , paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business ."
4679,"Mr. Dinkins , the ad charges , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office . ''"
4680,"`` David Dinkins , '' says the kicker , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught ? ''"
4681,"`` Nasty innuendoes , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist . ''"
4682,"Stung by the Giuliani ads , Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own ."
4683,"The screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians ."
4684,"`` Compare two candidates for mayor , '' says the announcer ."
4685,`` One says he 's for banning cop - killer bullets .
4686,The other has opposed a ban on cop - killer bullets .
4687,One claims he 's pro-choice .
4688,The other has opposed a woman 's right to choose . ''
4689,"`` Funny thing , '' says the kicker , `` both these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani . ''"
4690,Who 's telling the truth ?
4691,Everybody -- and nobody .
4692,It 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate .
4693,"Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job ."
4694,"He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it ."
4695,"The city 's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete ."
4696,The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors .
4697,"And , says Mr. Dinkins , he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a get - out - the - vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping ."
4698,"But , say Mr. Dinkins 's managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members ."
4699,"Mr. Giuliani 's campaign chairman , Peter Powers , says the Dinkins ad is `` deceptive . ''"
4700,"The other side , he argues , `` knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations ."
4701,"They know he is generally opposed to cop - killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . ''"
4702,Virginia :
4703,Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .
4704,"Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations ."
4705,"Then , just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians . ''"
4706,"That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion ."
4707,"The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad ."
4708,The Coleman counterattack featured a close - up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
4709,"A voice says , `` C'mon , now , do n't you have boyfriends ? ''"
4710,Then an announcer interjects : `` It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .
4711,"So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women , ask him about this law he tried to pass . ''"
4712,"Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers ."
4713,"The legislation itself noted that it was introduced `` by request , '' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation ."
4714,"`` People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , '' says Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College ."
4715,`` Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman . ''
4716,"Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours ."
4717,"By Tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims ."
4718,New Jersey :
4719,"The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter ."
4720,`` Remember Pinocchio ? '' says a female voice .
4721,`` Consider Jim Courter . ''
4722,"And then this commercial , produced by Bob Squier , gets down to its own mean and dirty business ."
4723,"Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his -LCB- Mr. Courter 's -RCB- property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud . ''"
4724,And the nose on Mr. Courter 's face grows .
4725,"The only fraud involved , cry Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the Florio commercial itself , and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial , produced by Mr. Ailes ."
4726,"In this one , the screen fills with photographs of both candidates ."
4727,`` Who 's really lying ? '' asks a female voice .
4728,"`` Florio 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on Courter 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution . ''"
4729,Mr. Courter 's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio 's grows .
4730,Who 's telling the truth ?
4731,"Stephen Salmore , a political scientist at New Jersey 's Eagleton Institute , says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate ."
4732,"Barrels were dumped on the Courter property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment ."
4733,"Even so , according to Mr. Salmore , the ad was `` devastating '' because it raised questions about Mr. Courter 's credibility ."
4734,But it 's building on a long tradition .
4735,"In 1966 , on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor , GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying , `` If you want to keep the crime rates high , O'Connor is your man . ''"
4736,"A seat on the Chicago Board of Trade was sold for $ 350,000 , down $ 16,000 from the previous sale last Friday ."
4737,"Seats currently are quoted at $ 331,000 , bid , and $ 350,000 , asked ."
4738,"The record price for a full membership on the exchange is $ 550,000 , set Aug. 31 , 1987 ."
4739,Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is propelling the region toward economic integration .
4740,Interviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades .
4741,But Japan 's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions .
4742,"The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion `` a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine , '' says Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp ."
4743,"In the past five years , Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in Asia to $ 5.57 billion ."
4744,"In Thailand , for example , the government 's Board of Investment approved $ 705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988 , 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year ."
4745,Japan 's commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade .
4746,Asia 's other cash - rich countries are following Japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region .
4747,"In Taiwan and South Korea , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor - intensive production ."
4748,"These nations , known as Asia 's `` little tigers , '' also are contributing to Southeast Asia 's integration , but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan 's ."
4749,"For recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia , the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth ."
4750,But Asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now .
4751,"Because of budget constraints in Washington , the U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region ."
4752,But it resists yielding political ground .
4753,"In the coming decade , analysts say , U.S. - Japanese relations will be tested as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic behemoth ."
4754,Japan 's swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution .
4755,"In the past decade , Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export ."
4756,"In the 1990s , spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world ."
4757,"To capture the investment , Southeast Asian nations will move to accommodate Japanese business ."
4758,"These nations ' internal decisions `` will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor , largest private investor and largest lender , '' says Richard Drobnick , director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California 's Graduate School of Business ."
4759,Japanese money will help turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region .
4760,"But , analysts say , Asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the European Common Market approach ."
4761,"Rather , Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors , says Kent Calder , a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University ."
4762,"In electronics , for example , a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan , assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia ."
4763,"`` The effect will be to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone , '' says Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Hormats ."
4764,Countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties .
4765,The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications .
4766,"Participants will include the U.S. , Australia , Canada , Japan , South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , the Philippines and Brunei ."
4767,"In addition , the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker , following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke ."
4768,The Baker proposal reasserts Washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region .
4769,"`` In Asia , as in Europe , a new order is taking shape , '' Mr. Baker said ."
4770,"`` The U.S. , with its regional friends , must play a crucial role in designing its architecture . ''"
4771,But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region .
4772,Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries -LRB- although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia -RRB- .
4773,"Moreover , the Japanese government , now the world 's largest aid donor , is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is ."
4774,"While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan 's enlarged role in Asia , they also convey an undertone of caution ."
4775,"`` There 's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions '' in Asia , says J. Michael Farren , undersecretary of commerce for trade ."
4776,"`` If they approach it with a benevolent , altruistic attitude , there will be a net gain for everyone . ''"
4777,Some Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington 's demand that Tokyo step up its military spending to ease the U.S. security burden in the region .
4778,The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S. 's leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea .
4779,Many Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence .
4780,"`` No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home , '' Mr. Hormats says ."
4781,"For their part , Taiwan and South Korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut ."
4782,"`` They do n't want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up , '' says Chong - sik Lee , professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania ."
4783,Cathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes .
4784,"While giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16 , she spotted a student looking at crib sheets ."
4785,"She had seen cheating before , but these notes were uncanny ."
4786,`` A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance ... .
4787,"At the end of World War II , Germany surrendered before Japan ... ."
4788,The Senate - House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms . ''
4789,"Virtually word for word , the notes matched questions and answers on the social - studies section of the test the student was taking ."
4790,"In fact , the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section ."
4791,"The student surrendered the notes , but not without a protest ."
4792,"`` My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test , '' he said ."
4793,The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school .
4794,"Confronted , Mrs. Yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low - ability geography classes ."
4795,She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers .
4796,Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security .
4797,"In September , she pleaded guilty and paid a $ 500 fine ."
4798,Her alternative was 90 days in jail .
4799,Her story is partly one of personal downfall .
4800,"She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students , but she will probably never teach again ."
4801,"In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer ; of colleagues who say she brought them shame ; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly ; and of school - district officials stunned that despite the bald - faced nature of her actions , she became something of a local martyr ."
4802,"Mrs. Yeargin 's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform , where pressures on teachers are growing and where high - stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat ."
4803,The 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina 's school - improvement laws .
4804,Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's 1984 Education Improvement Act .
4805,The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student - test scores .
4806,"`` There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores , '' says Walt Haney , an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College ."
4807,`` So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise . ''
4808,"And most disturbing , it is educators , not students , who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing ."
4809,"A 50 - state study released in September by Friends for Education , an Albuquerque , N.M. , school - research group , concluded that `` outright cheating by American educators '' is `` common . ''"
4810,"The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often `` teach the test '' as Mrs. Yeargin did , although most are never caught ."
4811,Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so .
4812,California 's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .
4813,"After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students , Texas is revising its security practices ."
4814,And sales of test - coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming .
4815,"These materials , including Macmillan / McGraw - Hill School Publishing Co. 's Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research ."
4816,"By using them , teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate , and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers ."
4817,"Use of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County , Mrs. Yeargin 's school district ."
4818,Experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in South Carolina .
4819,"Under the state 's Education Improvement Act , low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching , state - supervised `` interventions '' that can mean firings ."
4820,"High test scores , on the other hand , bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school , grants for special projects , a bonus for the superintendent ."
4821,And South Carolina says it is getting results .
4822,"Since the reforms went in place , for example , no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina , although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination ."
4823,Critics say South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much .
4824,Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating .
4825,"Says the organization 's founder , John Cannell , prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is `` a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously , when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all . ''"
4826,"Paul Sandifer , director of testing for the South Carolina department of education , says Mr. Cannell 's allegations of cheating `` are purely without foundation , '' and based on unfair inferences ."
4827,"Partly because of worries about potential abuse , however , he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement - test preparation booklets next spring ."
4828,South Carolina 's reforms were designed for schools like Greenville High School .
4829,"Standing on a shaded hill in a run - down area of this old textile city , the school has educated many of South Carolina 's best and brightest , including the state 's last two governors , Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward ."
4830,"But by the early 1980s , its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade ."
4831,"`` It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class , '' says Linda Ward , the school 's principal ."
4832,"`` Crime was awful , test scores were low , and there was no enrollment in honors programs . ''"
4833,"Mrs. Ward took over in 1986 , becoming the school 's seventh principal in 15 years ."
4834,Her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown .
4835,"Prior to his term , a teacher bled to death in the halls , stabbed by a student ."
4836,"Academically , Mrs. Ward says , the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate , and evenly split , student groups : a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks , many of them poor , from run - down , inner city neighborhoods ."
4837,"Mrs. Ward resolved to clean out `` deadwood '' in the school 's faculty and restore safety , and she also had some new factors working in her behalf ."
4838,"One was statewide school reform , which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment ."
4839,"Another was Nancy Yeargin , who came to Greenville in 1985 , full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward ."
4840,"`` Being a teacher just became my life , '' says the 37 - year - old Mrs. Yeargin , a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal . ``"
4841,"I loved the school , its history ."
4842,I even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students . ''
4843,"While Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum , Mrs. Yeargin worked 14 - hour days and fast became a student favorite ."
4844,"In 1986 - 87 and 1987 - 88 , she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law ."
4845,"Encouraged by Mrs. Ward , Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state `` teacher cadet '' program , a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career ."
4846,"She won grant money for the school , advised cheerleaders , ran the pep club , proposed and taught a new `` Cultural Literacy '' class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as `` Teacher of the Year . ''"
4847,"`` She was an inspirational lady ; she had it all together , '' says Laura Dobson , a freshman at the University of South Carolina who had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher - cadet class last year ."
4848,She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher .
4849,"Mary Beth Marchand , a Greenville 11th grader , also says Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education ."
4850,"`` She taught us more in Western Civilization than I 've ever learned in other classes , '' says Kelli Green , a Greenville senior ."
4851,"In the classroom , students say , Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college - bowl type competitions ."
4852,"On weekends , she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes , even to polish the furniture in her classroom ."
4853,"`` She just never gave it up , '' says Mary Marchand , Mary Beth 's mother ."
4854,`` You 'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game . ''
4855,"Some fellow teachers , however , viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students ."
4856,Mrs. Ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander .
4857,Pressures began to build .
4858,Friends told her she was pushing too hard .
4859,"Because of deteriorating hearing , she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer ."
4860,Mrs. Yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's incentive - bonus program .
4861,But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests .
4862,"Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $ 5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ 23,000 ."
4863,"Winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her , Mrs. Yeargin insists ."
4864,"But others at Greenville High say she was eager to win -- if not for money , then for pride and recognition ."
4865,"Mary Elizabeth Ariail , another social - studies teacher , says she believed Mrs. Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing ."
4866,"Indeed , Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program ."
4867,"Last March , after attending a teaching seminar in Washington , Mrs. Yeargin says she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her low - ability geography students adequately ."
4868,"When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students ."
4869,Mrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct .
4870,"`` I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation , '' she says ."
4871,`` Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions .
4872,"The rest were history , sociology , finance -- subjects they never had . ''"
4873,"Mrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School 's overall test scores , usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers ."
4874,"Mostly , she says , she wanted to prevent the damage to self - esteem that her low - ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test ."
4875,"`` These kids broke my heart , '' she says ."
4876,`` A whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive .
4877,"They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them , who loved them ."
4878,The last thing they needed was another drag - down blow . ''
4879,School officials and prosecutors say Mrs. Yeargin is lying .
4880,"They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help , although because the case was n't tried in court , this evidence was never presented publicly ."
4881,"`` That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child , '' says Joe Watson , the prosecutor in the case , who is also president of Greenville High School 's alumni association ."
4882,"Mrs. Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class , adding : `` I wanted to help all '' students ."
4883,Mr. Watson says Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair .
4884,`` Do I have much sympathy for her ? '' Mr. Watson asks .
4885,`` Not really .
4886,I believe in the system .
4887,I believe you have to use the system to change it .
4888,What she did was like taking the law into your own hands . ''
4889,"Mrs. Ward says that when the cheating was discovered , she wanted to avoid the morale - damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring ."
4890,She says she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate .
4891,Mrs. Yeargin declined .
4892,`` She said something like ` You just want to make it easy for the school . '
4893,"I was dumbfounded , '' Mrs. Ward recalls ."
4894,`` It was like someone had turned a knife in me . ''
4895,To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs . Yeargin won widespread local support .
4896,"The school - board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf ."
4897,"Supportive callers decried unfair testing , not Mrs. Yeargin , on a local radio talk show on which she appeared ."
4898,"The show did n't give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin 's offense , saying only that she helped students do better on the test ."
4899,"`` The message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state , '' said the talk - show host ."
4900,"Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong , but also said the case showed how testing was being overused ."
4901,"The radio show `` enraged us , '' says Mrs. Ward ."
4902,"Partly because of the show , Mr. Watson says , the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first - time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record ."
4903,And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case .
4904,"Over 50 witnesses , mostly students , were interviewed ."
4905,"At Greenville High School , meanwhile , some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed ."
4906,"`` It 's hard to explain to a 17 - year - old why someone they like had to go , '' says Mrs. Ward ."
4907,"Soon , T - shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school 's familiar red - and - white GHS logo on the front ."
4908,"On the back , the shirts read , `` We have all the answers . ''"
4909,Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin .
4910,"`` She did a lot of harm , '' says Cathryn Rice , who had discovered the crib notes ."
4911,"`` We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay , and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us . ''"
4912,But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores .
4913,"Says Gayle Key , a mathematics teacher , `` The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms ."
4914,There may be others doing what she did . ''
4915,"Mrs. Yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement , and because she was afraid of further charges ."
4916,"Mrs. Ward , for one , was relieved ."
4917,"Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin , popular sentiment was so strong in her favor , Mrs. Ward says , that `` I 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her ."
4918,"Since chalk first touched slate , schoolchildren have wanted to know : What 's on the test ?"
4919,"These days , students can often find the answer in test - coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests ."
4920,The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders : `` What is another name for the Roman numeral IX ? ''
4921,It also asks them to add two - sevenths and three - sevenths .
4922,"Worksheets in a test - practice kit called Learning Materials , sold to schools across the country by Macmillan / McGraw - Hill School Publishing Co. , contain the same questions ."
4923,"In many other instances , there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials ."
4924,"What 's more , the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company , Macmillan / McGraw - Hill , a joint venture of McGraw - Hill Inc. and Macmillan 's parent , Britain 's Maxwell Communication Corp ."
4925,"Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common , some educators and researchers say ."
4926,"Test - preparation booklets , software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry ."
4927,But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school - sponsored cheating .
4928,"`` If I took -LCB- these preparation booklets -RCB- into my classroom , I 'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating , '' says John Kaminski , a Traverse City , Mich. , teacher who has studied test coaching ."
4929,"He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which is to gauge learning progress ."
4930,"`` It 's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class , and when everybody aces the test , they say their kids are good in European history , '' says John Cannell , an Albuquerque , N.M. , psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization , Friends for Education , which has studied standardized testing ."
4931,Standardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade .
4932,"The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan / McGraw 's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills ; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills , by Houghton Mifflin Co. ; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test ."
4933,"Sales figures of the test - prep materials are n't known , but their reach into schools is significant ."
4934,"In Arizona , California , Florida , Louisiana , Maryland , New Jersey , South Carolina and Texas , educators say they are common classroom tools ."
4935,"Macmillan / McGraw says `` well over 10 million '' of its Scoring High test - preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago , with most sales in the last five years ."
4936,"About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers ' binders have also been sold in the past four years ."
4937,The materials in each set reach about 90 students .
4938,Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best - selling preparation tests .
4939,"Michael Kean , director of marketing for CTB Macmillan / McGraw , the Macmillan / McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials , says it is n't aimed at improving test scores ."
4940,He also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated .
4941,"When referred to the questions that matched , he said it was coincidental ."
4942,"Mr. Kaminski , the schoolteacher , and William Mehrens , a Michigan State University education professor , concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test ."
4943,They devised a 69 - point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth - grade CAT .
4944,"Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie and bar graphs , for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth - grade curriculum , Mr. Kaminski says , the preparation kits would n't replicate too many , if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures ."
4945,But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills .
4946,Scoring High matched on 64.5 .
4947,"In CAT sections where students ' knowledge of two - letter consonant sounds is tested , the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know ."
4948,Learning Materials for the fifth - grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items .
4949,"Rick Brownell , senior editor of Scoring High , says that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring `` the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format . ''"
4950,"He said authors of Scoring High `` scrupulously avoid '' replicating exact questions , but he does n't deny that some items are similar ."
4951,"When Scoring High first came out in 1979 , it was a publication of Random House ."
4952,McGraw - Hill was outraged .
4953,"In a 1985 advisory to educators , McGraw - Hill said Scoring High should n't be used because it represented a `` parallel form '' of the CAT and CTBS tests ."
4954,"But in 1988 , McGraw - Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High , which later became part of Macmillan / McGraw ."
4955,Messrs. Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw - Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High .
4956,Alleghany Corp. said it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $ 150 million .
4957,"The Sacramento - based S&L , which has 44 branch offices in north central California , had assets of $ 2.4 billion at the end of September ."
4958,New York - based Alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern .
4959,The purchase price includes two ancillary companies .
4960,The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal - tissue transplants .
4961,"Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Huntington 's ."
4962,But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal - tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions .
4963,"James Mason , assistant secretary for health , said the ban on federal funding of fetal - tissue transplant research `` should be continued indefinitely . ''"
4964,He said the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue - transplant research or federally funded fetal - tissue research that does n't involve transplants .
4965,"Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason 's ruling , which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health ."
4966,"Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion , as does President Bush , except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened ."
4967,"The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health , aware of the policy implications of its research , asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson 's disease ."
4968,"The department placed a moratorium on the research , pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues ."
4969,"A majority of an NIH - appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions , but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding ."
4970,The dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control .
4971,Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal - tissue transplants .
4972,"Antonio Novello , whom Mr. Bush nominated to serve as surgeon general , reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion ."
4973,Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
4974,Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts .
4975,"Earlier this week , Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by `` standards of scientific and administrative excellence , '' not politics ."
4976,But the administration 's handling of the fetal - tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists .
4977,"`` When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground , there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications , '' says Myron Genel , associate dean of the Yale Medical School ."
4978,"`` The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized , so that no mechanism exists '' for finding a middle ground ."
4979,Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal - tissue transplants .
4980,But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason 's ruling may discourage private funding .
4981,"`` The unavailability of federal funds , and the climate in which the decision was made , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support , '' he said ."
4982,"Despite the flap over transplants , federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts ."
4983,"`` Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer '' or to regulate genes that cause Down 's syndrome , the leading cause of mental retardation , according to an NIH summary ."
4984,The NIH currently spends about $ 8 million annually on fetal - tissue research out of a total research budget of $ 8 billion .
4985,"The Internal Revenue Service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ 10,000 in cash ."
4986,"The warnings , issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week , have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar , who claim the information is protected by attorney - client privilege ."
4987,"The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $ 10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 ."
4988,"The form asks for such details as the client 's name , Social Security number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment ."
4989,"Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November , when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison ."
4990,"Attorneys have argued since 1985 , when the law took effect , that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known ."
4991,"Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years , citing attorney - client privilege ."
4992,"Until last week , the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms ."
4993,"`` This form forces a lawyer to become , in effect , a witness against his client , '' said Neal R. Sonnett , president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers ."
4994,"`` The IRS is asking lawyers to red - flag a criminal problem to the government , '' added Mr. Sonnett , a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer - generated IRS forms sent by certified mail ."
4995,Mr. Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts .
4996,These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers .
4997,Mr. Sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers .
4998,"Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients , he said ."
4999,"The defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week , chaired by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt , to deal with the matter ."
5000,The American Bar Association 's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement .
5001,"Michael Ross , a New York lawyer who heads the ABA 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death ."
5002,"Mr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to discuss the issue last May ."
5003,"At that meeting , he said , the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice ."
5004,Mr. Ross said IRS officials opposed the Justice Department 's moderate stance on the matter .
5005,"But in the letters sent in recent days , Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit , told attorneys that `` failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . ''"
5006,"In some cases , the IRS asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985 ."
5007,"A spokesman for the IRS confirmed that `` there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now ."
5008,Individuals familiar with the Justice Department 's policy said that Justice officials had n't any knowledge of the IRS 's actions in the last week .
5009,"Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients , that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors ."
5010,Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business .
5011,But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases .
5012,Some criminal lawyers speculated that the IRS was sending the letters to test the issue .
5013,"In a number of recent cases , federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential ."
5014,THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim .
5015,"Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento , Calif ."
5016,"On Tuesday , the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm ."
5017,The reason : the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise .
5018,"`` A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years , and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan , '' the judge quipped in an interview ."
5019,"Federal judges make $ 89,500 annually ; in February , Congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50 % ."
5020,"Judge Ramirez , 44 , said it is unjust for judges to make what they do ."
5021,`` Judges are not getting what they deserve .
5022,You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an eye .
5023,"When you become a federal judge , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . ''"
5024,"At his new job , as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe , he will make out much better ."
5025,"The judge declined to discuss his salary in detail , but said : `` I 'm going to be a high - priced lawyer . ''"
5026,DOONESBURY CREATOR'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter .
5027,"Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $ 11 million , alleging it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line ."
5028,"The dispute involves Darkhorse Productions Inc. , a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner ."
5029,"Mr. Trudeau , a Writers Guild member , also was employed as a writer for Darkhorse , which was covered by a guild collective - bargaining agreement ."
5030,The guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988 .
5031,"In his lawsuit , Mr. Trudeau says the strike illegally included Darkhorse , and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company ."
5032,A spokesman for the guild said the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit .
5033,He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau .
5034,"Mr. Trudeau 's attorney , Norman K. Samnick , said the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year - long threats of disciplinary action ."
5035,Mr. Samnick said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in New York .
5036,"Mr. Samnick , who will go before the disciplinary panel , said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified ."
5037,"In addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. Trudeau ."
5038,ABORTION RULING UPHELD :
5039,A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family - planning programs that include abortion - related services .
5040,"A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so - called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion , such as abortion counseling and referrals ."
5041,"The rule also prohibits funding for activities that `` encourage , promote or advocate abortion . ''"
5042,"Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family - planning services , according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ."
5043,The panel ruled that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women .
5044,INQUIRY CLEARS TEXAS JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims .
5045,"Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December , two weeks after sentencing an 18 - year - old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park ."
5046,The judge was quoted as referring to the victims as `` queers '' and saying they would n't have been killed `` if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys . ''
5047,"But Robert R. Murray , a special master appointed by the Texas Supreme Court , said Judge Hampton did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case ."
5048,"Observing that the judge `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice , '' Mr. Murray concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim ."
5049,Mr. Murray also said Judge Hampton 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice .
5050,"The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct , which is empowered to impose sanctions ."
5051,GAF TRIAL goes to round three .
5052,Attorneys in the third stock - manipulation trial of GAF Corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the Manhattan courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe .
5053,"In an eight - count indictment , the government has charged GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , specialty chemical maker , and its Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin with attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in November 1986 ."
5054,The first two GAF trials ended in mistrials earlier this year .
5055,This trial is expected to last five weeks .
5056,SWITCHING TO THE DEFENSE :
5057,"A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran / Contra affair joined the Chicago firm of Mayer , Brown & Platt ."
5058,"Michael R. Bromwich , a member since January 1987 of the three - lawyer trial team in the prosecution of Oliver North , became a partner in the Washington , D.C. , office of the 520 - lawyer firm ."
5059,He will specialize in white - collar criminal defense work .
5060,"Mr. Bromwich , 35 , also has served as deputy chief and chief of the narcotics unit for the U.S. attorney 's office for the Southern District of New York , based in Manhattan ."
5061,"Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. said it has reached an agreement in principle to buy buildings and related property in Albany , Ga. , from Bridgestone / Firestone Inc ."
5062,Terms were n't disclosed .
5063,"The tire maker said the buildings consist of 1.8 million square feet of office , manufacturing and warehousing space on 353 acres of land ."
5064,"Fujitsu Ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company 's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects , while computer rival NEC Corp. made a written apology for indulging in the same practice ."
5065,"Meanwhile , business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers , and fretted about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about Japanese cutthroat pricing ."
5066,Fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a U.S. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years .
5067,"The company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10,000 yen , or about $ 70 , for another contract ."
5068,"But Fujitsu , Japan 's No. 1 computer maker , is n't alone ."
5069,"NEC , one of its largest domestic competitors , said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987 ."
5070,"In both cases , NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu , which made the same bid and won a tie - breaking lottery ."
5071,All the contracts were for computer - system - design contracts and involved no hardware or software .
5072,"The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies to `` make sure they understood '' the concern about such practices , according to a government spokesman ."
5073,"`` These cases lead to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility , '' a ministry statement said ."
5074,Japan 's Fair Trade Commission has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust - law violations .
5075,"`` We would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble , '' Fujitsu President Takuma Yamamoto , read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company 's downtown headquarters ."
5076,"The bids , he added , were `` contrary to common sense . ''"
5077,"NEC released a statement saying , `` We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society , '' a form of apology common in Japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations ."
5078,Japanese companies have long had a reputation for sacrificing short - term profits to make a sale that may have long - term benefits .
5079,But the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here -- such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs -- are coming under close ethical scrutiny .
5080,The fire is also fueled by growing international interest in Japanese behavior .
5081,So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue .
5082,"But in one of the auctions in question , International Business Machines Corp. made a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer , according to the municipality ."
5083,The low - ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate .
5084,"Foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in Japan , in part because Japanese companies unfairly undercut them ."
5085,The U.S. government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make .
5086,"Asked whether the bidding flap would hurt U.S. - Japan relations , Mr. Yamamoto said , `` this will be a minus factor . ''"
5087,The `` one - yen '' controversy first came to a head last week when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks .
5088,"The city had expected to pay about 11 million yen -LRB- $ 77,000 -RRB- , but Fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free ."
5089,"Then Wednesday , Fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in Nagano prefecture two weeks earlier ."
5090,"It also said that in July , it bid 10,000 yen to design a system for the Saitama prefectural library , and two years ago , it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for Wakayama prefecture ."
5091,The company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano .
5092,The municipalities said they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts .
5093,"Fujitsu and NEC said they were still investigating , and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge ."
5094,"Mr. Yamamoto insisted that headquarters had n't approved the bids , and that he did n't know about most of the cases until Wednesday ."
5095,Other major Japanese computer companies contacted yesterday said they have never made such bids .
5096,"`` One yen is not ethical , '' Michio Sasaki , an official at Keidanren , the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations , said ."
5097,"`` Profit may be low , but at least costs should be covered ."
5098,PAPERS :
5099,"Backe Group Inc. agreed to acquire Atlantic Publications Inc. , which has 30 community papers and annual sales of $ 7 million ."

5106,Sales in stores open more than one year rose 3 % to $ 29.3 million from $ 28.4 million .
5107,Furukawa Co. of Japan said it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in France formerly belonging to Dresser Industries Inc. of the U.S. .
5108,The company said it made the purchase in order to locally produce hydraulically operated shovels .
5109,"Last October , the company also bought a wheel - loader manufacturing plant in Heidelberg , West Germany , from Dresser ."
5110,Furukawa said the purchase of the French and German plants together will total about 40 billion yen -LRB- $ 280 million -RRB- .
5111,"Structural Dynamics Research Corp. , which makes computer - aided engineering software , said it introduced new technology in mechanical design automation that will improve mechanical engineering productivity ."

5120,"While market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish U.S. economic indicators , dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U.S. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark ."
5121,"At the same time , dealers said the U.S. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks , in part because the hefty Japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark 's strength , resulting in a stalemate ."
5122,"Jay Goldinger , with Capital Insight Inc. , reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in New York -- the strength of the U.S. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar - denominated bonds , rather than mark bonds ."
5123,"`` Dollar - yen -LCB- trade -RCB- is the driving force in the market , '' said Tom Trettien , a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York , `` but I 'm not convinced it will continue ."
5124,"Who knows what will happen down the road , in three to six months , if foreign investment starts to erode ? ''"
5125,"In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8500 marks , up from 1.8415 marks late Tuesday , and at 143.80 yen , up from 142.85 yen late Tuesday ."
5126,"Sterling was quoted at $ 1.5755 , down from $ 1.5805 late Tuesday ."
5127,"In Tokyo Thursday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen , up from Wednesday 's Tokyo close of 143.08 yen ."
5128,"Douglas Madison , a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles , traced the dollar 's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings ."
5129,He contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp. 's announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified .
5130,"He cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group , as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia - Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence ."
5131,"The forthcoming maturity in November of a 10 - year Japanese government yen - denominated bond issue valued at about $ 16 billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar - denominated instruments , according to Mr. Madison ."
5132,It remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over .
5133,"Meanwhile , traders in Tokyo say that the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions ."
5134,They point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high - yield U.S. Treasury debt and suggest demand for the U.S. unit will continue unabated until rates in the U.S. recede .
5135,"The market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing U.S. economy , and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than U.S. economic indicators ."
5136,Dealers said the dollar merely drifted lower following the release Wednesday of the U.S. purchasing managers ' report .
5137,"The managers ' index , which measures the health of the manufacturing sector , stood at 47.6 % in October , above September 's 46 % , and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3 % ."
5138,"Some dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50 , which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy ."
5139,But most said the index had no more than a minimal effect on trade .

5143,"`` The Cosby Show '' may have single - handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984 , and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network ."
5144,But some of the TV stations that bought `` Cosby '' reruns for record prices two years ago are n't laughing much these days .
5145,The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows .
5146,"But the ratings are considerably below expectations , and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire ."
5147,"Meanwhile , stations are fuming because , many of them say , the show 's distributor , Viacom Inc. , is giving an ultimatum : Either sign new long - term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing `` Cosby '' to a competitor ."
5148,"At the same time , Viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to `` A Different World , '' a spin - off of `` Cosby '' whose reruns will become available in 1991 ."
5149,Viacom denies it 's using pressure tactics .
5150,"`` We 're willing to negotiate , '' says Dennis Gillespie , executive vice president of marketing ."
5151,`` We 're offering this plan now because we feel it 's the right time . ''
5152,"But , says the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest , `` I think if I tell them I need more time , they 'll take ` Cosby ' across the street , ''"
5153,Viacom 's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks .
5154,One station manager says he believes Viacom 's move is a `` pre-emptive strike '' because the company is worried that `` Cosby '' ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years .
5155,"`` Cosby '' is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2 - 8 over the same week a year ago , according to A.C. Nielsen Co ."
5156,Mr. Gillespie at Viacom says the ratings are rising .
5157,"And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington ; Providence , R.I. ; Cleveland ; Raleigh , N.C. ; Minneapolis , and Louisville , Ky. , say they may very well not renew `` Cosby . ''"
5158,"Dick Lobo , the general manager of WTVJ , the NBC - owned station in Miami , for example , says the show has `` been a major disappointment to us . ''"
5159,"`` At the prices we were charged , there should have been some return for the dollar ."
5160,There was n't . ''
5161,"Neil Kuvin , the general manager of WHAS , the CBS affiliate in Louisville , says `` Cosby '' gets the station 's highest ratings and he 's `` pleased . ''"
5162,"But he adds , `` I feel pressured , disappointed , uncomfortable and , frankly , quite angry with Viacom ."

5166,"In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars , a lot of revenue - desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space ."
5167,So can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers ?
5168,"Garbage magazine , billed as `` The Practical Journal for the Environment , '' is about to find out ."
5169,"Founded by Brooklyn , N.Y. , publishing entrepreneur Patricia Poore , Garbage made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis ."
5170,"The magazine combines how - to pieces on topics like backyard composting , explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet , and hard - hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders ."
5171,Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America 's good guys and bad boys .
5172,"In one feature , called `` In the Dumpster , '' editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender ."
5173,"From an advertising standpoint , the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days ."
5174,"With only two issues under its belt , Garbage has alienated some would - be advertisers and raised the ire of others ."
5175,"Campbell Soup , for one , is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere `` In the Dumpster '' column ."
5176,"The magazine 's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging 's polystyrene foam , polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable ."
5177,"`` It 's precisely the kind of product that 's created the municipal landfill monster , '' the editors wrote ."
5178,"`` I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage , but it is practicing journalistic garbage , '' fumes a spokesman for Campbell Soup ."
5179,He says Campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment .
5180,"Modifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed , he says , making it less an offender than was portrayed ."
5181,"He admits , though , it is n't one of Campbell Soup 's better products in terms of recyclability ."
5182,"Campbell Soup , not surprisingly , does n't have any plans to advertise in the magazine , according to its spokesman ."
5183,Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue 's big spenders .
5184,"`` You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you 're going to make a run of it , '' says Mike White , senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham , Chicago ."
5185,"`` The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base '' of big - time ad spenders , he adds ."
5186,"The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers , including General Electric and Adolph Coors , but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International , firms that do n't spend much money advertising and ca n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul ."
5187,"A Waste Management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one - time purchase , and it does n't have any plans to advertise in future issues ."
5188,"`` We do n't spend much on print advertising , '' she says ."
5189,"But Ms. Poore , the magazine 's editor and publisher , contends Garbage can survive , at least initially , on subscription revenues ."
5190,Individual copies of the magazine sell for $ 2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $ 21 .
5191,"-LRB- It is , of course , printed on recycled paper . -RRB-"
5192,"According to Ms. Poore , Old - House Journal Corp. , her publishing company , printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue ."
5193,"The first and second issues sold out on newsstands , she says , and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions ."
5194,"Asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine 's direct policy , Ms. Poore replies : `` I do n't know and I do n't care ."
5195,"I 'm not saying advertising revenue is n't important , '' she says , `` but I could n't sleep at night '' if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad ."

5197,INTERPUBLIC ON TV :
5198,"Interpublic Group said its television programming operations -- which it expanded earlier this year -- agreed to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across Europe in 1990 ."
5199,"It said the programs , largely game shows , will be provided by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International , a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49 % ."
5200,It said that volume makes it the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe .
5201,"Interpublic is providing the programming in return for advertising time , which it said will be valued at more than $ 75 million in 1990 and $ 150 million in 1991 ."
5202,It plans to sell the ad time to its clients at a discount .
5203,NEW ACCOUNT :
5204,"CoreStates Financial Corp. , Philadelphia , named Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro , Philadelphia , as agency of record for its $ 5 million account ."
5205,"The business had been handled by VanSant Dugdale , Baltimore ."
5206,AT&T FAX :
5207,"American Telephone & Telegraph 's General Business Systems division , New York , awarded the ad account for its Fax product line to Ogilvy & Mather , New York , a WPP Group agency ."
5208,"Billings were n't disclosed for the small account , which had been serviced at Young & Rubicam , New York ."
5209,FIRST CAMPAIGN :
5210,Enterprise Rent - A - Car Inc. breaks its first national ad campaign this week .
5211,"The St. Louis firm specializes in replacement - car rentals , those provided by insurance companies for cars damaged in accidents ."
5212,"Developed by Avrett , Free & Ginsberg , New York , the $ 6 million campaign pitches Enterprise 's consumer - driven service and its free pick - up and drop - off service ."
5213,LANDOR ASSOCIATES :
5214,"Young & Rubicam said it completed its acquisition of Landor Associates , a San Francisco identity - management firm ."
5215,ACQUISITION :
5216,"Ketchum Communications , Pittsburgh , acquired Braun & Co. , a Los Angeles investor - relations and marketing - communications firm ."
5217,Terms were n't disclosed .
5218,"The Transportation Department , responding to pressure from safety advocates , took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles ."
5219,"The department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans , beginning with 1992 models ."
5220,It also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap - shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year .
5221,Such belts already are required for the vehicles ' front seats .
5222,"`` Today 's action , '' Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said , `` represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards . ''"
5223,"In September , the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front - seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars ."
5224,The Big Three auto makers said the rule changes were n't surprising because Bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans .
5225,"Safety advocates , including some members of Congress , have been urging the department for years to extend car - safety requirements to light trucks and vans , which now account for almost one - third of all vehicle sales in the U.S. ."
5226,They say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars .
5227,They did n't have much luck during the Reagan administration .
5228,"`` But now , there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem , '' said Chuck Hurley , vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ."
5229,`` We 're in a very different regulatory environment . ''
5230,"Sen. John Danforth -LRB- R. , Mo . -RRB- praised the department 's actions , noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light - truck deaths ."
5231,"`` We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof - crush standards , '' he said ."
5232,"Sen. Danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans , including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side - crash protection ."
5233,"The department 's roof - crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less ."
5234,The roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle .
5235,"During the test , the roof could n't be depressed more than five inches ."
5236,"In Detroit , a Chrysler Corp. official said the company currently has no rear - seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks , but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year ."
5237,"He said Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light - truck line by the Sept. 1 , 1991 , deadline ."
5238,Chrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof - crush resistance standard for cars .
5239,"John Leinonen , executive engineer of Ford Motor Co. 's auto - safety office , said Ford trucks have met car standards for roof - crush resistance since 1982 ."
5240,Ford began installing the rear - seat belts in trucks with its F - series Crew Cab pickups in the 1989 model year .
5241,"The new Explorer sport - utility vehicle , set for introduction next spring , will also have the rear - seat belts ."
5242,Mr. Leinonen said he expects Ford to meet the deadline easily .
5243,"Consolidated Rail Corp. said it would spend more than $ 30 million on 1,000 enclosed railcars for transporting autos ."
5244,"The multilevel railcars , scheduled for delivery in 1990 , will be made by Thrall Manufacturing Co. , a Chicago Heights , Ill. , division of closely held Duchossois Industries Inc. , Elmhurst , Ill ."
5245,"This year , the railroad holding company acquired 850 such railcars ."
5246,"Sir Peter Walters , 58 - year - old chairman of British Petroleum Co. until next March , joins the board of this cement products company on Dec. 1 ."
5247,"Sir Peter will succeed Sir John Milne , 65 , who retires as Blue Circle nonexecutive chairman on June 1 ."
5248,"Michael Henderson , 51 - year - old group chief executive of this U.K. metals and industrial materials maker , will become chairman in May , succeeding Ian Butler , 64 , who is retiring ."
5249,Mr. Butler will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director .
5250,Rally 's Inc. said it has redeemed its rights outstanding issued Monday in its shareholder rights plan .
5251,The company said holders of stock of record Nov. 10 will receive 1/10th of one cent a share as the redemption payment .
5252,"The fast - food company said its decision was based upon discussions with a shareholder group , Giant Group Ltd. , `` in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company . ''"
5253,"Giant Group is led by three Rally 's directors , Burt Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II , who last month indicated they hold a 42.5 % stake in Rally 's and plan to seek a majority of seats on Rally 's nine - member board ."
5254,"When Warren Winiarski , proprietor of Stag 's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley , announced a $ 75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall , few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked ."
5255,"`` This is the peak of my wine - making experience , '' Mr. Winiarski declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New York , `` and I wanted to single it out as such . ''"
5256,"It is in my estimation the best wine Stag 's Leap has produced , and with fewer than 700 cases available , it is sure to sell quickly ."
5257,"The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon , but it is not the highest ."
5258,Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $ 100 a bottle .
5259,"One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production , of exceptional quality -LRB- or so perceived , at any rate -RRB- , and with exceedingly high prices ."
5260,"For years , this group included a stable of classics -- Bordeaux first growths -LRB- Lafite - Rothschild , Latour , Haut - Brion , Petrus -RRB- , Grand Cru Burgundies -LRB- Romanee - Conti and La Tache -RRB- deluxe Champagnes -LRB- Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal -RRB- , rarefied sweet wines -LRB- Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany , and Biondi - Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany -RRB- ."
5261,These first magnitude wines ranged in price from $ 40 to $ 125 a bottle .
5262,"In the last year or so , however , this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members ."
5263,"The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition , and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle , among current releases from every major wine region on the globe ."
5264,France can boast the lion 's share of high - priced bottles .
5265,"Bordeaux 's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $ 60 to $ 80 each -LRB- except for the smallest in terms of production , Chateau Petrus , which costs around $ 250 ! -RRB- ."
5266,"These prices seem rather modest , however , in light of other French wines from current vintages ."
5267,"Chateau Yquem , the leading Sauternes , now goes for well over $ 100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984 ; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $ 179 ."
5268,"In Champagne , some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $ 100 a bottle ."
5269,The first Champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs .
5270,The '82 Salon is $ 115 .
5271,Roederer Cristal at $ 90 a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger 's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level .
5272,The great reds of the Rhone Valley have soared in price as well .
5273,"E. Guigal 's 1982 Cote Rotie La Landonne , for example , is $ 120 ."
5274,"None of France 's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy , however ."
5275,"The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee - Conti , 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world , have commanded three - digit price tags for several years now ."
5276,"With the 1985 vintage , they soared higher : La Tache , $ 195 ; Richebourg , $ 180 ; Romanee - Conti , $ 225 ."
5277,"Another small Burgundy estate , Coche - Dury , has just offered its 1987 Corton - Charlemagne for $ 155 ."
5278,"From Italy there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $ 125 a bottle , Piero Antinori 's La Solaia , a $ 90 Cabernet from Tuscany , and Biondi - Santi Brunello at $ 98 ."
5279,"Spain 's Vega Secilia Unico 1979 -LRB- released only in its 10th year -RRB- is $ 70 , as is Australia 's Grange Hermitage 1982 ."
5280,"`` There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices , '' says Larry Shapiro of Marty 's , one of the largest wine shops in Dallas ."
5281,`` What 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out .
5282,We 're seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce . ''
5283,"Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines , Mr. Shapiro continued : `` We 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s , which go for $ 300 to $ 400 a bottle ."
5284,"Some of the newer wines , even at $ 90 to $ 100 a bottle or so , almost offer a bargain . ''"
5285,Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek .
5286,It 's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly -LRB- the last was 1979 -RRB- and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987 .
5287,"Owner Al Brownstein originally planned to sell it for $ 60 a bottle , but when a retailer in Southern California asked , `` Is that wholesale or retail ? '' he re-thought the matter ."
5288,"Offering the wine at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale -LRB- $ 100 retail -RRB- , he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 -RRB- no , the wine is too high -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- yes , it 's high but I 'll take it -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- I 'll take all I can get -LRB- 58 responses -RRB- ."
5289,"The wine was shipped in six - bottle cases instead of the usual 12 , but even at that it was spread thin , going to 62 retailers in 28 states ."
5290,"`` We thought it was awfully expensive , '' said Sterling Pratt , wine director at Schaefer 's in Skokie , Ill. , one of the top stores in suburban Chicago , `` but there are people out there with very different opinions of value ."
5291,We got our two six - packs -- and they 're gone . ''
5292,Mr. Pratt remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on .
5293,"Even if there is consumer resistance at first , a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move ."
5294,"`` There may be sticker - shock reaction initially , '' said Mr. Pratt , `` but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell , they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection . ''"
5295,"`` It 's just sort of a one - upsmanship thing with some people , '' added Larry Shapiro ."
5296,"`` They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace -LCB- one of Diamond Creek 's Cabernets -RCB- or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet , or the Petrus ."
5297,Producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people . ''
5298,That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly .
5299,But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago .
5300,"`` They wo n't buy if the quality is not there , '' said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans ."
5301,`` Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less . ''
5302,"Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines -LRB- like Grgich Hills Chardonnay , now $ 32 -RRB- just to slow down movement , but he is beginning to see some resistance to high - priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range ."
5303,"Image has , of course , a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't , and it ca n't be forced ."
5304,"Wine merchants ca n't keep Roederer Cristal in stock , but they have to push Salon le Mesnil , even lowering the price from $ 115 to $ 90 ."
5305,"It 's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine , but , as Mr. Pratt noted , people have their own ideas about value ."
5306,It 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door .
5307,"In every major market in the U.S. , for instance , you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg , virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux -LRB- except Petrus -RRB- , as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and , at the moment , the Stag 's Leap 1985 Cask 23 ."
5308,"With the biggest wine - buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach , it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare ."
5309,By January it should be fairly clear what 's hot -- and what 's not .
5310,Ms. Ensrud is a free - lance wine writer in New York .
5311,"Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short - term interest rates , but it is n't clear whether the central bank will do so ."
5312,"A survey by the Fed 's 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks , while upward pressures on prices have moderated ."
5313,"`` The economy is clearly slowing , '' says Robert Black , president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank ."
5314,"`` If you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5 % growth , I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter , '' agrees Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey ."
5315,"Nevertheless , both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern ."
5316,"`` We 're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur , '' said Mr. Guffey ."
5317,"Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates , and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well ."
5318,"`` I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date , '' said Robert Johnson , vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co ."
5319,"The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75 % after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , but has shown no sign of movement since ."
5320,"The report from the Fed found that manufacturing , in particular , has been weak in recent weeks ."
5321,"The Philadelphia Fed , for instance , reported that manufacturing activity `` continues to decline '' for the fourth month in a row ."
5322,"And in the Chicago district , the report said , `` a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types , including defense equipment , petroleum equipment , food packaging machinery and material handling equipment . ''"
5323,"Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts , particularly `` for discretionary , big - ticket items such as furniture , home appliances and consumer electronics . ''"
5324,And construction also was described as slow in most areas .
5325,"Despite the economic slowdown , there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt ."

5339,"But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling , which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes , Congress is almost certain to act in time to avoid default ."

5388,Criticism in the U.S. over recent Japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries ' relations .
5389,Officials from both nations say the U.S. public 's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington .
5390,"Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions ; indeed , each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S. ."
5391,Where they disagree is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan .
5392,The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment ; Japan denies there are real barriers .
5393,"The heated talk stirred up by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate , even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks , known as the Structural Impediments Initiative ."
5394,"The Japanese `` should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy , '' says Charles Dallara , U.S. assistant Treasury secretary , who has been in Tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders ."
5395,"`` We have a long history of maintaining an open direct - investment policy , '' Mr. Dallara says ."
5396,`` U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment '' in Japan .
5397,The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public 's rancor .
5398,"One clear sign of Japan 's nervousness came this week , when a spokesman for Japan 's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular , half - hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. ."
5399,"`` We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests -LCB- in the U.S. . -RCB- to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people , '' said the spokesman , Taizo Watanabe ."
5400,"At the same time , though , he chastised the media for paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries , notably Britain , are acquiring more American assets ."
5401,"Fears that Japanese investors are buying up America have escalated sharply in the past several weeks , with Sony Corp. 's purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca - Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's acquisition of a 51 % holding in Rockefeller Group , the owner of some of midtown Manhattan 's most exclusive real estate ."
5402,"Even before those moves added fuel , the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in Japan of one U.S. investor , T. Boone Pickens Jr ."
5403,"The Texas oilman has acquired a 26.2 % stake valued at more than $ 1.2 billion in an automotive - lighting company , Koito Manufacturing Co ."
5404,But he has failed to gain any influence at the company .
5405,"Koito has refused to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board , asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure Koito 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit ."
5406,Mr. Pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in Japan .
5407,"The Senate Finance Committee , chaired by a fellow Texan , Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen , last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens 's experience in talks with Tokyo `` to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets . ''"
5408,"While Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say the question of investors ' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention , a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks ."
5409,"Among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending ."
5410,Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other .
5411,The U.S. says it is anxious for results .
5412,"`` We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified , and we need it by next spring , '' Mr. Dallara says ."
5413,Both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed .
5414,But they have n't clarified what those might be .
5415,"After the first set of meetings two months ago , some U.S. officials complained that Japan had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make ."
5416,The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions .
5417,"`` Just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything , '' says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official ."
5418,`` We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it . ''
5419,"That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time , the Japanese say , no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results ."
5420,"For instance , at the first meeting the two sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions ."
5421,"Since then , a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices ."
5422,"By Monday , they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust ."
5423,"`` Little by little , there is progress , '' says the MITI official ."
5424,`` Both sides are taking action . ''
5425,Elisabeth Rubinfien contributed to this article .
5426,"While worry grows about big Japanese investments in the U.S. , Japan 's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in America 's smaller business ."
5427,"For Japan , the controversial trend improves access to American markets and technology ."
5428,"But for small American companies , it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help ."
5429,"Take the deal with Candela Laser Corp. , a Wayland , Mass. , manufacturer of high - tech medical devices , which three years ago set its sights on Japan as an export market ."
5430,"Partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate Japan , tiny Candela turned to Mitsui & Co. , one of Japan 's largest trading companies , for investment ."
5431,"In a joint - venture deal , Mitsui guided Candela through Tokyo 's bureaucratic maze ."
5432,It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions .
5433,"At last count , Candela had sold $ 4 million of its medical devices in Japan ."
5434,The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high - tech medical product .
5435,"`` They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach , '' says Richard Olsen , a Candela vice president ."
5436,"Indeed , for many Japanese trading companies , the favorite U.S. small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future Japanese use ."
5437,"The Japanese companies bankroll many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas , frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch ."
5438,"Japanese companies have financed small and medium - sized U.S. firms for years , but in recent months , the pace has taken off ."
5439,"In the first half of 1989 alone , Japanese corporations invested $ 214 million in minority positions in U.S. companies , a 61 % rise from the figure for all of 1987 , reports Venture Economics Inc ."
5440,"The Needham , Mass. , concern tracks investments in new businesses ."
5441,"In addition , of course , some of the Japanese investments involved outright purchase of small U.S. firms ."
5442,"Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large , highly visible U.S. corporations , such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc ."
5443,"Only this week , it was announced that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51 % stake in Rockefeller Group , which owns New York 's prestigious Rockefeller Center ."
5444,"While the small deals are far less conspicuous , they add to Japanese penetration of the U.S. market ."
5445,"As the deals also improve Japanese access to American technology and market knowledge , they feed American anxieties in this area , too ."
5446,Even a low - tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company 's fancy if there 's a strategic fit .
5447,"Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton , Va. , a small fabricator of architectural glass , was foundering under its original management ."
5448,"Last year , Mitsubishi International Corp. , the New York - based arm of Mitsubishi Corp. , bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner , a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant ."
5449,"The deal is chiefly designed to give Mitsubishi a window on the U.S. glass industry , says Ichiro Wakui , an executive in Mitsubishi 's general merchandise department in New York ."
5450,"`` It 's not just a simple investment in a small company , '' Mr. Wakui says ."
5451,"`` We want to see the glass market from the inside , not the outside . ''"
5452,"Mitsubishi 's investment in Free State is `` very small ... less than $ 4 million , '' Mr. Wakui says ."
5453,Mr. Bodner declines to comment on the arrangement .
5454,"Trading companies such as Mitsubishi , Mitsui , C. Itoh & Co. and Nissho - Iwai Corp. , which make many of the Japanese investments in small U.S. concerns , have no U.S. counterpart ."
5455,"These vertically integrated combines , some of which got their start in Japan 's feudal period , deal globally in commodities , construction and manufacturing ."
5456,They operate ships and banks .
5457,"`` All the `` sogo - shosha '' are looking for new business , '' says Arthur Klauser , adviser to the president of Mitsui , U.S.A. , using the Japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses ."
5458,"Adds Takeshi Kondo , senior vice president of C. Itoh America Inc. : `` We have a great interest in making investments , particularly in new ventures . ''"
5459,A host of electronics firms in California 's Silicon Valley were financed with trading - company venture capital .
5460,"Profit , at least in the short term , is usually a secondary goal ."
5461,"`` Strategic objectives , not financial return , drive many of the deals , '' says a Venture Economics spokesman ."
5462,"In investing on the basis of future transactions , a role often performed by merchant banks , trading companies can cut through the logjam that small - company owners often face with their local commercial banks ."
5463,"`` It 's the classic problem of the small businessman , '' says Malcolm Davies , managing director of Trading Alliance Corp. of New York ."
5464,`` People are queuing at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic .
5465,"They want assets , they want a balance sheet , which has no relation to the business a company can generate . ''"
5466,"Adds Mitsui 's Mr. Klauser : `` Unlike corporations in this country , trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows ."
5467,"To the extent they can do this , they 're quite content to get a return on investment of 1 % to 2 % . ''"
5468,Mr. Klauser says Mitsui has 75 U.S. subsidiaries in which it holds 35 % interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its U.S. affiliates in 1990 .
5469,Sales by these subsidiaries in the fiscal year ending last March were more than $ 17 billion .
5470,"A 1 % to 2 % return on $ 17 billion `` ai n't hay , '' Mr. Klauser says ."
5471,"Hudson General Corp. 's president and chief executive officer , Alan J. Stearn , resigned ."
5472,"Mr. Stearn , 46 years old , could n't be reached for comment ."
5473,A company spokesman declined to elaborate on the departure .
5474,"Hudson General , which provides maintenance , fueling and other services to airlines and airports , reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares ."
5475,"Mr. Stearn , who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984 , will act as a consultant to Hudson General ."
5476,His duties as chief executive will be assumed by Chairman Jay B. Langner .
5477,"For 10 years , Genie Driskill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient ."
5478,"A high - balance customer that banks pine for , she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving , nor to the fees she was paying ."
5479,"But in August , First Atlanta National Bank introduced its Crown Account , a package designed to lure customers such as Ms. Driskill ."
5480,"Among other things , it included checking , safe deposit box and credit card -- all for free -- plus a good deal on installment loans ."
5481,"All she had to do was put $ 15,000 in a certificate of deposit , or qualify for a $ 10,000 personal line of credit ."
5482,"`` I deserve something for my loyalty , '' she says ."
5483,She took her business to First Atlanta .
5484,So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days .
5485,"For nearly a decade , banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans ."
5486,The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services .
5487,But many banks are turning away from strict price competition .
5488,"Instead , they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population ."
5489,"`` You 're dead in the water if you are n't segmenting the market , '' says Anne Moore , president of Synergistics Research Corp. , a bank consulting firm in Atlanta ."
5490,"NCNB Corp. of Charlotte , N.C. , recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers ."
5491,"The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $ 18,000 , but throws in a special cash - flow statement to help in saving money ."
5492,"In September , Union Planters Corp. of Memphis , Tenn. , launched The Edge account , a package designed for the `` thirtysomething '' crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees , and a full percentage point off on installment loans ."
5493,"The theory : Such individuals , many with young children , are in their prime borrowing years -- and , having borrowed from the bank , they may continue to use it for other services in later years ."
5494,"For some time , banks have been aiming packages at the elderly , the demographic segment with the highest savings ."
5495,Those efforts are being stepped up .
5496,"Judie MacDonald , vice president of retail sales at Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville , Fla. , says the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles ."
5497,"`` Varying age , geography and life - style differences create numerous sub-markets , '' Ms. MacDonald says ."
5498,She says individual Barnett branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests .
5499,"`` An active 55 - year - old in Boca Raton may care more about Senior Olympic games , while a 75 - year - old in Panama City may care more about a seminar on health , '' she says ."
5500,Banks have tried packaging before .
5501,"In 1973 , Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account , which included free checking , a credit card , safe - deposit box and travelers checks for a $ 3 monthly fee ."
5502,"The concept begot a slew of copycats , but the banks stopped promoting the packages ."
5503,One big reason : thin margins .
5504,"Many banks , particularly smaller ones , were slow to computerize and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable ."
5505,"As banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s , the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs ."
5506,"But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age , income and geography ."
5507,They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s .
5508,"Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits , as well as opened up the field for new products such as high - rate CDs ."
5509,"Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account , it began offering money - market accounts , certificates of deposit and interest - bearing checking , and staggering rates based on the size of deposits ."
5510,The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market - share battles into small towns across the nation .
5511,"`` Today , a banker is worrying about local , regional and money - center -LCB- banks -RCB- , as well as thrifts and credit unions , '' says Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research ."
5512,`` So people who were n't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base . ''
5513,The competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer .
5514,"`` The average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions , '' says Michael P. Sullivan , who runs his own bank consulting firm in Charlotte , N.C ."
5515,`` This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today 's rate - sensitive customers costly . ''
5516,Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place .
5517,"For their troubles , the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate ."
5518,"The more accounts customers have , Mr. Sullivan says , the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it ."
5519,"That can pay off down the road as customers , especially the younger ones , change from borrowers to savers / investors ."
5520,Packaging has some drawbacks .
5521,"The additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive ."
5522,"Chemical Bank spent more than $ 50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed at different segments , in 1986 , according to Thomas Jacob , senior vice president of marketing ."
5523,"`` It 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay , '' Mr. Jacob says ."
5524,"Still , bankers expect packaging to flourish , primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs ."
5525,"`` These days , banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them , '' Ms. Moore says ."
5526,"Some banks are already moving in that direction , according to Alvin T. Sale , marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte ."
5527,"First Union , he says , now has packages for seven customer groups ."
5528,"Soon , it will split those into 30 ."
5529,"Says Mr. Sale : `` I think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store , not the boutique . ''"
5530,IRAs .
5531,"SHAREDATA Inc. said it will amend a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares ."

5539,4 . Buy a diamond necklace .
5540,5 . Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings - and - loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan .
5541,"Americans today spend $ 15,000 like pocket change -- they do n't think much about it ."
5542,But for an ailing savings - and - loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise .

5549,"As a Foster Corporate Parent , you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass , Lewis Ranieri , William Simon and others , who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves ."

5551,Do n't wait -- a savings institution needs your help now !
5552,"Every day you delay , a savings institution 's health -- and the federal budget deficit -- grows worse ."

5554,Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line .

5560,The Chicago Merc said a new one - hour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor 's 500 stock - index futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
5561,"If the 20 - point limit is triggered after 1:30 p.m . Chicago time , it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m ."
5562,"With the limit in effect , members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices , but not below it ."
5563,"The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock - index futures on Friday Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock - index futures prices skidded as well ."
5564,"Late that afternoon the S&P 500 stock - index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points , hitting a Merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session ."
5565,"The Merc said that its existing 30 - minute , 12 - point limit on S&P 500 stock - index futures trading -LRB- equal to about 100 points on the Dow Jones industrials -RRB- , which was triggered Oct. 13 , will remain in effect ."
5566,"Leo Melamed , Merc executive committee chairman , said that the 12 - point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13 ."
5567,"But when the contract reopened , the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30 - point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock - index futures prices synchronized ."
5568,Several traders maintained that the Merc 's 12 - point circuit - breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange .
5569,"All of the changes require regulatory approval , which is expected shortly ."
5570,"The exchange also said that the 30 - point circuit breaker , which currently provides only a one - hour respite during market sell - offs , will become the maximum one - day limit for the S&P 500 stock - index futures contract ; the one - day limit now is 50 index points ."
5571,A final modification was made to the five - point opening limit for the contract .
5572,The Merc said that five - point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading .
5573,The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading .
5574,"In Washington , House aides said Mr. Phelan told congressmen that the collar , which banned program trades through the Big Board 's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points , did n't work well ."
5575,He said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually .
5576,"In a post-hearing news conference , Mr. Phelan , who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility , said he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program - trading halt proposal `` providing the SEC would be comfortable with the language '' in a bill ."
5577,"The program - trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street , and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile ."
5578,"SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points , but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs ."
5579,A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could `` come out feeling good . ''
5580,"At one point , Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman , Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers ."
5581,"`` Markey said we could have done this in public '' because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the aide said ."
5582,"Mr. Phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel , the aide added ."
5583,"At another point during the hearing , Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what would be discussed at a New York exchange board meeting today ."
5584,Mr. Phelan said the Big Board is likely to study the program - trading issue .
5585,"That response annoyed Rep. Markey , House aides said , and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter ."
5586,"Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing , most notably Rep. John Dingell -LRB- D. , Mich. -RRB- , the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman , who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months ."
5587,"Mr. Dingell expressed concern , sources said , about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades ."
5588,"The futures industry is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses ."
5589,"The art of change - ringing is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world ."
5590,"-- Dorothy L. Sayers , `` The Nine Tailors ''"
5591,"ASLACTON , England"
5592,"-- Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong ."
5593,"The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have ."
5594,"In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 ."
5595,"But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be heard by the church - goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening ."
5596,"Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service ."
5597,"Now , only one local ringer remains : 64 - year - old Derek Hammond ."
5598,The others here today live elsewhere .
5599,They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes - exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia .
5600,"`` To ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape , '' says Mr. Hammond , a retired water - authority worker ."
5601,"`` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . ''"
5602,Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing .
5603,"History , after all , is not on his side ."
5604,"According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them ."
5605,It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
5606,"The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners ."
5607,"Change - ringing , a mind - boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration ."
5608,"Proper English bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest - pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells ."
5609,"Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking ."
5610,"Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state ."
5611,"Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd - sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters ."
5612,"A series of 5,000 or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes about three hours ."
5613,A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved .
5614,"Ten shirt - sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize - fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber ."
5615,"No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling ."
5616,"Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope - sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls ."
5617,"Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth - up position ."
5618,"Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change ."
5619,"In a well - known detective - story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ''"
5620,"Ringers , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed . ''"
5621,"`` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers ."
5622,"It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however ."
5623,"More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry ."
5624,"When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below ."
5625,This does not sit well with some clerics .
5626,"With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong - willed vicars are pressing equally strong - willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services ."
5627,"Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest ."
5628,"`` They were a self - perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' the Vicar Hummerstone says ."
5629,"An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington , several of whom are members of the congregation ."
5630,But there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells .
5631,"At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust - up over church attendance ."
5632,"The vicar , W.D. Jones , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound . ''"
5633,"But C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar ."
5634,"`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' he says ."
5635,"Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell - ringer himself ."
5636,"`` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , '' he says ."
5637,`` I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life . ''
5638,"The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says John C. Baldwin , president ."
5639,"It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ''"
5640,"Says Mr. Baldwin , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ''"
5641,Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers .
5642,"One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring ."
5643,"Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner - city churches ."
5644,"But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says Mr. Baldwin ."
5645,"`` Right now , we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 , '' he adds ."
5646,One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male - dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women .
5647,"They are n't accepted everywhere , however ."
5648,"The oldest bell - ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male - only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey ."
5649,"This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal - opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers ."
5650,"One writer , signing his letter as `` Red - blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . ''"
5651,"In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer - belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . ''"
5652,"Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry ."
5653,"I have seen one or two men die , bless them ."
5654,Investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks .
5655,That has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10 % .
5656,"But do n't breathe too easy : Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices , some analysts warn ."
5657,"In the past , they say , the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock - market party was almost over ."
5658,"That can be a trap for unwary investors , says Richard Bernstein , senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co ."
5659,"Strong dividend growth , he says , is `` the black widow of valuation '' -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating ."
5660,"Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund , explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time ."
5661,"`` Invariably , those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments , '' he says ."
5662,`` And recessionary environments are n't hospitable to the stock market . ''
5663,"Indeed , analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks ."
5664,"In 1976 , for example , dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index soared 10 % , following much slower growth the year before ."
5665,"The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976 , and fell 12 % in 1977 -- despite a 15 % expansion in dividends that year ."
5666,"That pattern has n't always held , but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious ."
5667,"Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10 % in 1988 , according to Standard & Poor 's Corp. , and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 % and 14 % ."
5668,"Many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year , although a minority see double - digit gains continuing ."
5669,"Meanwhile , many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag : While dividends have risen smartly , their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices ."
5670,"As a result , the market 's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards ."
5671,"Put another way , the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay , some market analysts say ."
5672,They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500 .
5673,"The figure is currently about 3.3 % , up from 3.2 % before the recent market slide ."
5674,Some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3 % .
5675,"A drop below that 3 % benchmark `` has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued , '' says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price ."
5676,"In fact , `` the market has always tanked ."
5677,Always .
5678,"There 's never been an exception , '' says Gerald W. Perritt , a Chicago investment adviser and money manager , based on a review of six decades of stock - market data ."
5679,The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3 % was in the summer of 1987 .
5680,Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle .
5681,"There have been only seven other times -- in 1929 , 1933 , 1961 , 1965 , 1968 , 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3 % for at least two consecutive months , Mr. Perritt found ."
5682,"And in each case , he says , a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year ."
5683,"Still , some market analysts say the current 3.3 % reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past ."
5684,"`` It 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner , '' says James H. Coxon , head of stock investments for Cigna Corp. , the Philadelphia - based insurer ."
5685,"In particular , Mr. Coxon says , businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically ."
5686,"So , while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends , they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength ."
5687,"Rather than increasing dividends , some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares , notes Steven G. Einhorn , co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman , Sachs & Co ."
5688,He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6 % .
5689,"That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so , he says ."
5690,What will happen to dividend growth next year ?
5691,"Common wisdom suggests a single - digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits ."
5692,"PaineWebber Inc. , for instance , is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5 % in 1990 , down from an estimated 11 % this year ."
5693,"In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4 % to a decline of 1 % , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger ."
5694,"The minority argument , meanwhile , is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken ."
5695,Dividend growth on the order of 12 % is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs .
5696,Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures .
5697,One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends .
5698,"A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago , S&P said Wednesday ."
5699,That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year - earlier pace .
5700,"While the S&P tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes , a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year ."
5701,"In any case , opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double - digit levels ."
5702,Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12 % to 15 % total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a `` cash rate of return '' of perhaps 7 % or 8 % if dividend growth is weak .
5703,"But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price , who also expects 12 % growth in dividends next year , does n't think it will help the overall market all that much ."
5704,"`` Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook , but I do n't think it 's a main consideration , '' he says ."
5705,"With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year , `` I would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels ."
5706,"Your Oct. 13 page - one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell 's offer to it of his invention , because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph ."
5707,Such is hardly the case .
5708,"Bell 's father - in - law , Gardner G. Hubbard , wealthy and well - connected , obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston , which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York ."
5709,This is where Bell 's patents went .
5710,Western Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business .
5711,"It acquired Thomas Edison 's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather , Emile Berliner , which had been sold to Bell for a princely $ 50,000 , infringed upon Western Union 's Edison patent ."
5712,"When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison 's application , Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company 's current plight ."
5713,"Oliver Berliner Beverly Hills , Calif ."
5714,Troubled NBI Inc. said it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business to focus on its software and service operations .
5715,"The ailing company , which has reported net losses for 16 consecutive quarters , said it wo n't manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force ."
5716,"Altogether , NBI said it will eliminate 266 jobs at its Boulder headquarters , 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its Canadian and United Kingdom headquarters ."
5717,The company 's work force will fall to about 400 people .
5718,"Stephen G. Jerritts , president and chief executive officer , said customers were n't willing to commit to an expensive NBI hardware systems because of the company 's financial troubles ."
5719,"Further , he said , the company does n't have the capital needed to build the business over the next year or two ."
5720,"`` We flat ran out of financing resources , '' Mr. Jerritts said ."
5721,`` We had to do something structurally and radically different . ''
5722,"As a result , he said NBI will focus on servicing its installed base of systems , trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business , using some of the applications it developed for its hardware ."
5723,The company currently offers a word - processing package for personal computers called Legend .
5724,"The company , which recently said it lacked the profits and capital to pay dividends on its Series A convertible preferred stock , said it has hired an investment banker to help it raise additional cash ."
5725,"In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NBI common closed at 93 cents a share , up 31 cents ."
5726,It was Richard Nixon 's first visit to China in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between Beijing and Washington .
5727,"But the former U.S. president 's sixth visit to China , during which he spoke at length with Chinese leaders , was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the Sino - U.S. relationship ."
5728,"Mr. Nixon , the most prominent American to come to China since Beijing 's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June , harped on international outrage over the massacre ."
5729,"The Chinese , in turn , took aim at American `` interference '' in China 's domestic affairs ."
5730,"One official newspaper , Legal Daily , even directly criticized Mr. Nixon , who is normally referred to here as an `` old friend . ''"
5731,"The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of `` peaceful evolution , '' a catch phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere ."
5732,"The tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon 's final banquet toast , normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship ."
5733,"Instead , Mr. Nixon reminded his host , Chinese President Yang Shangkun , that Americans have n't forgiven China 's leaders for the military assault of June 3 - 4 that killed hundreds , and perhaps thousands , of demonstrators ."
5734,"`` Many in the United States , including many friends of China , believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified , '' Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang , who was directly involved in ordering the attack ."
5735,`` The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China . ''
5736,The Chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion .
5737,"In talks with Mr. Nixon , Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings , and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring ."
5738,"In a meeting Tuesday , supreme leader , Deng Xiaoping , told Mr. Nixon , `` Frankly speaking , the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago ."
5739,China was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China for it . ''
5740,"Despite the harsh exchanges , the U.S. and China still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations , which have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to as `` the greatest crisis in Chinese - American relations '' since his initial visit to China 17 years ago ."
5741,"In his return toast to Mr. Nixon , Mr. Yang said the relationship had reached a `` stalemate . ''"
5742,"Relations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7 , when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife , Li Shuxian , took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing ."
5743,"Shortly afterwards , Mr. Bush imposed a series of anti-China sanctions , including suspension of most high - level talks , which could be codified in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks ."
5744,"Mr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen , but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration ."
5745,"Mr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , before coming to China on Saturday ."
5746,"And he plans to brief the president at the end of the week , U.S. sources said ."
5747,Mr. Nixon was to leave China today .
5748,"According to an American member of the Nixon party , the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top - level Chinese officials ."
5749,"These included China 's economic policies , human rights and the question of Mr. Fang ."
5750,"Mr. Nixon also proposed that China restore its participation in the Fulbright Program , a U.S. government - funded academic exchange ."
5751,China pulled out of the program in July .
5752,"In his talks , the former president urged China 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas ."
5753,"`` Ideas are going over borders , and there 's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down , '' he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday ."
5754,"There are no signs , however , of China 's yielding on key issues ."
5755,"But in one minor matter , Mr. Nixon appears to have gained a concession ."
5756,"In a meeting with Premier Li Peng on Monday , Mr. Nixon said that he hoped he would n't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy ."
5757,"Sure enough , when he arrived at the embassy two days later , the machine - gun - toting guards were gone -- for the first time in five months ."
5758,"A few blocks away , at the U.S. ambassador 's residence , the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their Uzi - model arms for the first time since early June ."
5759,"But the guards there retained their pistols , and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars ."
5760,"Moreover , police and soldiers continue to harass Americans , who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week ."
5761,"Several times , Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger ."
5762,The rifles were n't loaded .
5763,"Your Oct. 6 article `` Japan 's Financial Firms Lure Science Graduates '' states , `` Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing Japan 's economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees . ''"
5764,The Japanese industrial companies should know better .
5765,"They are barking up the wrong tree , because it is basically their fault they ca n't attract new employees ."
5766,"Takuma Yamamoto , president of Fujitsu Ltd. , believes `` the ` money worship ' among young people ... caused the problem . ''"
5767,He is just passing the buck to young people .
5768,What 's wrong with asking for more money ?
5769,"Money is not everything , but it is necessary , and business is not volunteer work ."
5770,It is not unethical to choose a higher - salaried job .
5771,"Unfortunately , Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages ."
5772,I get the impression that some Japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful .
5773,"I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers , but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them ."
5774,"Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images , but they should realize that the most important thing is real change , not changing people 's perceptions ."

5777,"In reference to your Oct. 9 page - one article `` Barbara Bush Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the President , '' it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives : `` Among liberals , 60 % have positive views of her , while 50 % approve of the president 's job performance ."
5778,"In part , this may reflect the fact that ` she speaks a more progressive language ' than her husband , as Columbia 's Prof . -LCB- Ethel -RCB- Klein puts it ."
5779,"Among professionals , 76 % have a favorable opinion of her , compared to 62 % who approve of her husband 's performance ."
5780,"While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bush 's handling of his job , only 15 % have a negative view of his spouse . ''"
5781,The statistics imply that three - quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush 's job performance and 85 % of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush .
5782,"If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful , the positive view is even more newsworthy ."
5783,"Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious , stereotyped perspective ."
5784,Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator .

5836,"Program traders are fond of predicting that if they are blocked in the U.S. , they will simply emigrate to foreign stock markets ."
5837,"But in London and Tokyo , where computer - driven trading now plays a small but growing role , traders say a number of hurdles loom ."
5838,"Government officials , especially in Japan , probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the U.S. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business ."
5839,"Japan is `` very concerned '' about the possible effects of program trading , a senior Japanese official said after the Oct. 13 stock plunge in New York ."
5840,U.S. stock - index futures are n't even traded in Japan now .
5841,"And because of the time difference , the Japanese and the U.S. markets ' trading hours do n't overlap ."
5842,"It all adds up to a barrier to American - style index arbitrage , the most popular form of U.S. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in New York and the price of a futures contract in Chicago based on those stocks ."
5843,"About 11.6 % of all program trading by New York Stock Exchange firms in September took place in foreign markets , according to Big Board data ."
5844,Yet it is difficult to imagine Japan racing to introduce Chicago - style stock - index futures .
5845,"Japan 's Finance Ministry already is scrutinizing institutional investors ' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading , said Makato Utsumi , vice minister for international finance ."
5846,Program trading has taken off in Japan since last year 's introduction of home - market stock - index futures trading on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges .
5847,But regulators are wary .
5848,"They have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec. 7 , when the first bout of foreign - led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half - hour of trading , startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing ."
5849,Japan 's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time .
5850,"`` Maybe it was n't enough , '' a Finance Ministry official noted after the Dec. 7 surge ."
5851,Japan 's regulators have since tightened controls on index - related stock purchases .
5852,"Tokyo 's leading program traders are the big U.S. securities houses , though the Japanese are playing catch - up ."
5853,"Some U.S. firms , notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. , have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage , both for customers and for their own accounts ."
5854,-LRB- Morgan Stanley last week joined a growing list of U.S. securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts . -RRB-
5855,"Both Deryck C. Maughan , who heads Salomon in Tokyo , and John S. Wadsworth , who heads Morgan Stanley there , ascribe a good part of their firms ' success in Tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated , futures - related investment strategies to big institutional clients ."
5856,They do n't have plans to cut back .
5857,"`` It has not been disruptive in the markets here , '' Mr. Maughan said ."
5858,`` The real difference seems to be that the cash market here ... is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in America . ''
5859,The British also are scrutinizing program trades .
5860,"Index - arbitrage trading is `` something we want to watch closely , '' an official at London 's Stock Exchange said ."
5861,`` We do n't think there is cause for concern at the moment . ''
5862,London serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of U.S. stocks .
5863,Market professionals said London has several attractions .
5864,"First , the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the U.S. or London stock trading tapes ."
5865,"Second , it can be used to unwind positions before U.S. trading begins , but at prices pegged to the previous session 's Big Board close ."
5866,"In addition to the extra privacy of these trades , the transactions can often be less expensive to execute , because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee ."
5867,"Still , `` Much less -LCB- index - arbitrage activity -RCB- is done over here than in the U.S. '' said Richard Barfield , chief investment manager at Standard Life Assurance Co. , which manages about # 15 billion -LRB- $ 23.72 billion -RRB- in United Kingdom institutional funds ."
5868,Britain has two main index - arbitrage instruments .
5869,A Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 - share index option contract is traded on the London Stock Exchange 's Traded Options Market .
5870,And an FT - SE futures contract is traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange .
5871,Both contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash .
5872,The average number of FT - SE option contracts traded on the London exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in 1984 .
5873,"This year , the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118 , up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984 ."
5874,"But a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index - options trading was only 15 % of the size of the underlying equity market , exchange officials said ."
5875,This compares with estimates that the U.S. `` derivatives '' market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market .
5876,"The House voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981 , casting a solid 382 - 37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush ."
5877,The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor .
5878,"Advocates said the 90 - cent - an - hour rise , to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 , is too small for the working poor , while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs ."
5879,"But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress , after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise ."
5880,"So both sides accepted the compromise , which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four - year law was enacted in 1977 , raising the wage to $ 3.35 an hour from $ 2.65 ."
5881,"Under the measure passed yesterday , the minimum wage would rise to $ 3.80 next April ."
5882,The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it .
5883,"`` There are no smiles about this bill , '' Rep. Pat Williams -LRB- D. , Mont . -RRB- said during House floor debate yesterday ."
5884,"But `` because it 's all we 've got , I 'm going to vote for it . ''"
5885,"While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage , the level of $ 4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35 % of average factory pay , Mr. Williams said ."
5886,"But Rep. Marge Roukema -LRB- R. , N.J . -RRB- instead praised the House 's acceptance of a new youth `` training '' wage , a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years ."
5887,"Adopting a training - wage policy means `` getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage , '' Mrs. Roukema said ."
5888,"Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage , but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force ."
5889,"Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea , but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence ."
5890,"The compromise sets the training wage at $ 3.35 an hour next April , and at $ 3.61 an hour , or 85 % of the minimum wage , in April 1991 ."
5891,"Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days , without restriction , to workers with less than six months of job experience , and for another 90 days if the company uses a government - certified training program for the young workers ."
5892,The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old .
5893,The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six - month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job .
5894,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , still opposed to any mininum - wage increase , said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27 % in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 `` will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers ."
5895,"Zenith Data Systems Corp. , a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp. , received a $ 534 million Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84 - month period ."
5896,Rockwell International Corp. won a $ 130.7 million Air Force contract for AC - 130U gunship replacement aircraft .
5897,Martin Marietta Corp. was given a $ 29.9 million Air Force contract for low - altitude navigation and targeting equipment .
5898,Federal Data Corp. got a $ 29.4 million Air Force contract for intelligence data handling .
5899,"For six years , T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode : kind and gentle ."
5900,The question now : Can he act more like hard - charging Teddy Roosevelt ?
5901,"Mr. Hahn , the 62 - year - old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia - Pacific Corp. is leading the forest - product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp ."
5902,"Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder , a reaction Mr. Hahn has n't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions , all of which were negotiated behind the scenes ."
5903,"So far , Mr. Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough ."
5904,"`` We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , '' he says ."
5905,"But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war , with all that implies ."
5906,"If a competitor enters the game , for example , Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival ."
5907,"Given that choice , associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold ."
5908,"`` There 's a price above which I 'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay , '' says A.D. Correll , Georgia - Pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper ."
5909,"Says long - time associate Jerry Griffin , vice president , corporate development , at WTD Industries Inc. : `` He is n't of the old school of winning at any cost . ''"
5910,"He also is a consensus manager , insiders say ."
5911,"The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa , for example , was made only after all six members of Georgia - Pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on , says Mr. Correll ."
5912,Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute .
5913,"Assuming that post at the age of 35 , he managed by consensus , as is the rule in universities , says Warren H. Strother , a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn ."
5914,But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand .
5915,"In 1970 , Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building ."
5916,"That impressed Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia - Pacific 's chief executive at the time , whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute ."
5917,"In 1975 , Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; the move befuddled many in Georgia - Pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world ."
5918,"But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on ."
5919,"The son of a physicist , Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates ."
5920,"Moving rapidly through school , he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18 , after spending only 2 1/2 years in college ."
5921,He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
5922,"Mr. Hahn agrees that he has a `` retentive '' memory , but friends say that 's an understatement ."
5923,They call it `` photographic '' .
5924,Mr. Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of Georgia - Pacific .
5925,"Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983 , he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession - inspired slide in its building - products business ."
5926,"Mr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses , such as oil and gas and chemicals ."
5927,He even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers .
5928,"At the same time , he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling , rather than materials for new - home construction ."
5929,The idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new - home construction .
5930,"The formula has paid off , so far ."
5931,"Georgia - Pacific 's sales climbed to $ 9.5 billion last year , compared with $ 6 billion in 1983 , when Mr. Hahn took the reins ."
5932,Profit from continuing operations has soared to $ 467 million from $ 75 million .
5933,Mr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best .
5934,"`` The record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive , '' he says ."
5935,Nekoosa would n't be a diversification .
5936,"It would be a good match , Mr. Hahn and many analysts say , of two healthy companies with high - quality assets and strong cash flows ."
5937,The resulting company would be the largest forest - products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ 13 billion .
5938,But can Mr. Hahn carry it off ?
5939,"In this instance , industry observers say , he is entering uncharted waters ."
5940,"Says Kathryn McAuley , an analyst at First Manhattan Co. : `` This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced ."
5941,A House - Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment .
5942,"For the Agency for International Development , appropriators approved $ 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program , and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $ 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package ."
5943,"The conference approved at least $ 55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well , and though no decision was made , both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration ."
5944,"The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget ."
5945,"These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe ."
5946,"To accommodate the additional cash assistance , the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $ 140 million from the Pentagon ."
5947,"And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant , recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively ."
5948,"The action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $ 220 million for international population planning activities , an 11 % increase over fiscal 1989 ."
5949,"The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant ."
5950,"In a second area of common concern , the world environment , an additional $ 15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant ."
5951,"The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market ."
5952,"Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21 - month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 ."
5953,"About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate ."
5954,"The potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million , and House Majority Whip William Gray -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English - speaking countries of the Caribbean , such as Jamaica and Barbados ."
5955,"Rep. Jerry Lewis , a conservative Californian , added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia , and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye ."

5962,Beauty Takes Backseat To Safety on Bridges
5963,EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced .
5964,But there 's disagreement over how to do it .
5965,Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through .
5966,"But other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features ."
5967,"`` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department ."
5968,"He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four - foot - high concrete slab with no openings ."
5969,"In Richmond , Ind. , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge ."
5970,"Garret Boone , who teaches art at Earlham College , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that blocks the view of a new park below ."
5971,"In Hartford , Conn. , the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced , the cast - iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park ."
5972,Compromises are possible .
5973,"Citizens in Peninsula , Ohio , upset over changes to a bridge , negotiated a deal : The bottom half of the railing will be type F , while the top half will have the old bridge 's floral pattern ."
5974,"Similarly , highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington , D.C. , as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road ."

5980,Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling .

5996,Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose .
5997,"`` In Moscow , they kept asking us things like , ` Why do you make 15 different corkscrews , when all you need is one good one ? ' '' he says ."
5998,`` They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones . ''
5999,Seed for Jail Solution Fails to Take Root
6000,IT 'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal : Eggers Group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners .
6001,"It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures , the company says ."
6002,"But New York state , which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage , says `` no . ''"
6003,"Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six - inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the New York firm says ."
6004,"Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits ."
6005,"Besides , Eggers says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt ."
6006,"A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers says ."
6007,"A medium - sized one in Brooklyn , it says , could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York ."
6008,"A spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea `` not effective or cost efficient ."
6009,"The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants , and proposed $ 7.3 million in fines , the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer ."
6010,"The department 's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $ 6.1 million for alleged violations at the company 's Fairless Hills , Pa. , steel mill ; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility ."
6011,"OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical , crane - safety , record - keeping and other requirements ."
6012,"A second citation covering the company 's Clairton , Pa. , coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical - safety and other requirements , for which OSHA proposed $ 1.2 million in fines ."
6013,"Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said , `` The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health , and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards . ''"
6014,OSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972 .
6015,"Gerard Scannell , the head of OSHA , said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years , `` yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards . ''"
6016,"`` Particularly flagrant , '' Mrs. Dole said , `` are the company 's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works , in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate - wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies . ''"
6017,That settlement was in April 1987 .
6018,A USX spokesman said the company had n't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine .
6019,"`` Once we do , they will receive very serious evaluation , '' the spokesman said ."
6020,`` No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees . ''
6021,USX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works .
6022,"He said that , if and when safety problems were identified , they were corrected ."
6023,The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell .
6024,"He has promised stiffer fines , though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year ."
6025,"`` The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants , '' said Linda Anku , OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia ."
6026,"USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties , before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission ."
6027,"Before the USX case , OSHA 's largest proposed fine for one employer was $ 4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co. , a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co. , Cincinnati ."
6028,The company is contesting the fine .
6029,"Due to an editing error , a letter to the editor in yesterday 's edition from Frederick H. Hallett mistakenly identified the NRDC ."
6030,It should be the Natural Resources Defense Council .
6031,Your Oct. 6 editorial `` The Ill Homeless '' referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
6032,Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance - abusing people in the homeless population .
6033,We have made no such statement .
6034,It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless .
6035,The `` causes '' of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .
6036,In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism .
6037,You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
6038,"They suffered from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape ."
6039,"Homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care ."
6040,"In a recent report , the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter ."
6041,"The interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` effect . ''"
6042,"If we look to the future , preventing homelessness is an important objective ."
6043,"This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research ."

6045,"A study by Tulane Prof. James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty ."
6046,"The study shows that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems ."
6047,"According to Dr. Wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level .

6050,"After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation , you 're scarcely in touch with reality any more ; without psychiatric treatment , you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again . ''"
6051,"Some of the homeless , obviously , had pre-existing mental illness or addiction ."
6052,"But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim , brutal world of our city streets ."
6053,"Once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than drink , drugs or insanity ?"
6054,"Maxwell R.D. Vos Brooklyn , N.Y ."
6055,You dismiss as `` sentimental '' the view that the reduction of federal housing - assistance programs by 77 % might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan - Bush years .
6056,"There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness ."
6057,Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made .

6059,"Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless , you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen , insinuating that the march got its major support from self - serving groups that `` know a good thing when they see it , '' and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive ."
6060,"But is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to , and advertise in , your paper ?"
6061,Why did n't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march ?

6066,The House passed legislation designed to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy - outs .
6067,The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor .
6068,"The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry , but the 300 - 113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto ."
6069,The broader question is where the Senate stands on the issue .
6070,"While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy - outs , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor ."
6071,"Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline , it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt ."
6072,"`` The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete , '' Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt , -LRB- R. , Ark . -RRB- said ."
6073,"The bill , as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline ."
6074,The department would be required to block the buy - out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline - related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .
6075,"The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio -LRB- D. , Ore. -RRB- that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees , or their wages or benefits ."
6076,"Rep. James Traficant -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- , said the amendment , which passed 271 - 147 , would `` let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally . ''"
6077,"But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision , which he dubbed a `` special interest '' amendment , was likely to make the bill even more controversial ."
6078,"On Tuesday , the House approved a labor - backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code ."
6079,"The provision , called the `` two - time - losers '' amendment by its supporters , apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline ."
6080,Follow - up report :
6081,You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week .
6082,"You can even take notes -- extensive notes , for the Voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder -- about what you read ."
6083,You can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress .
6084,And my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts .
6085,"Until the other day , you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world ."
6086,That was the law .
6087,And I apparently had no right to print hither what the Voice was booming to yon .
6088,It was censorship .
6089,It was outrageous .
6090,And it was stupid .
6091,The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't propagandize its own people .
6092,"That sounds neat , but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own people every day ."
6093,"Government press releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military facilities , publications are all propaganda of sorts ."
6094,"Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint , and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue ."
6095,The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd : An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform .
6096,"In June 1988 , I wrote in this space about this issue ."
6097,"Assuming it was n't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door , I 'll review the facts ."
6098,The Voice of America is a government agency that broadcasts news and views -- some might say propaganda -- in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world .
6099,It does a first - rate job .
6100,Its budget $ 184 million -- is paid for by you .
6101,But a 1948 law barred the `` dissemination '' of that material in the U.S. .
6102,"The law let scholars , reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material , only at VOA headquarters in Washington , but it barred them from copying texts ."
6103,"And , of course , there 's that word `` dissemination . ''"
6104,How 's that again ?
6105,"`` You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying , '' a Voice official explained when I asked ."
6106,"What if I tune in my short - wave radio , transcribe an editorial or program , and print it in my newspaper ?"
6107,"`` Nor are you free to reprint such material , '' I was advised ."
6108,"That sounded a lot like censorship , so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere , I sued ."
6109,"A couple of weeks ago , I lost the case in federal district court in Des Moines ."
6110,"At least , that 's the way it was reported ."
6111,"And , indeed , the lawsuit was dismissed ."
6112,"But I -- I like to think of it in terms of we , all of us -- won the point ."
6113,"For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling : The United States Information Agency , which runs the Voice , changed its position on three key points ."
6114,"-- The USIA said that , on reflection , of course I could print anything I could get my hands on ."
6115,"The word dissemination , it decided , referred only to itself ."
6116,"`` The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States , '' my lawyer , the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines , said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost ."
6117,"The court noted the new USIA position but , just in case , officially found `` that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically . ''"
6118,"-- The USIA said that , on reflection , anyone could view the VOA materials , not just the reporters , scholars , researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute ."
6119,"`` The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials , notwithstanding the statutory designations , because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials , '' Mr. McCormick noted ."
6120,-- And the USIA said that all of us could take extensive notes .
6121,"`` The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and , while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes , no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken , '' Mr. McCormick reported ."
6122,"I had sought , in my suit , the right to print Voice material , which had been denied me , and I had sought a right to receive the information , arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if I have no right to get the information ."
6123,But the court disagreed .
6124,"`` The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech , '' Judge Donald O'Brien ruled ."
6125,`` The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press . ''
6126,So now the situation is this :
6127,You have a right to read Voice of America scripts if you do n't mind traveling to Washington every week or so and visiting the Voice office during business hours .
6128,I have a right to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- copy them out in long hand .
6129,But neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox machine or have it sent to us .
6130,"In an era when every government agency has a public - relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not , this does seem odd ."
6131,"Indeed , Judge O'Brien ruled that `` it would be easy to conclude that the USIA 's position is ` inappropriate or even stupid , ' '' but it 's the law ."
6132,"So the next step , I suspect , is to try to get the law changed ."
6133,We -LRB- I assume you 're in this with me at this point -RRB- need to get three words -- `` for examination only '' -- eliminated from the law .
6134,"Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says Voice material shall be available to certain of us -LRB- but now , thanks to the USIA 's new position , all of us -RRB- `` for examination only . ''"
6135,"If those words were n't there , the nice people at the Voice would be able to send you the information or , at the very least , let you photocopy it ."
6136,This is not a trivial issue .
6137,`` You have ... raised important questions which ought to be answered : What does USIA say about America abroad ; how do we say it ; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions ? '' a man wrote me a couple of years ago .
6138,The man was Charles Z. Wick .
6139,"At the time , he was director of the"
6140,He had no answers then .
6141,Now there are some .
6142,This democracy is suddenly a little more democratic .

6185,The company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ 800 million from $ 40 million during Mr. Bernstein 's tenure .
6186,"`` Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly , '' said Mr. Newhouse ."
6187,"`` The company is doing well , it 's stable , it 's got good people ."
6188,Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time . ''
6189,"Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily ."
6190,"Crown Publishing Group , acquired last year , is said to be turning in disappointing results ."
6191,"As a private company , Random House does n't report its earnings ."
6192,"Mr. Bernstein , who succeeded Bennett Cerf , has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925 ."
6193,Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house .
6194,"Possible candidates include Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine / Del Rey / Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division ."
6195,"Some say Anthony Cheetham , head of a recently acquired British company , Century Hutchinson , could be chosen ."
6196,"There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who left Random House 's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker , also owned by the Newhouse family ."
6197,"Not included on the most - likely - successor list are Joni Evans , recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House , and Sonny Mehta , president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit ."
6198,"When Ms. Evans took her job , several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full - time administrator ."
6199,Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less - than - brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently .
6200,"Mr. Bernstein , a tall , energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive , has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues ."
6201,"Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent ... . ''"
6202,This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress .
6203,"It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution ."
6204,This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .
6205,"The appropriations clause states that `` No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ... . ''"
6206,The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding .
6207,This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran - Contra Report .
6208,"As partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers ."
6209,It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution .
6210,"The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to Madison 's notes ."
6211,"To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability ."
6212,"Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation ."
6213,"It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB- could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress ."
6214,"As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money ."
6215,"During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable ."
6216,The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II .
6217,"Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. ."
6218,"It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . ''"
6219,Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . ''
6220,"Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II ."
6221,Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing .
6222,The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary .
6223,"The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government ."
6224,The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution .
6225,"Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress ."
6226,"Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations ."
6227,"Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market - oriented alternatives to regulations ."
6228,Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost - benefit scrutiny .
6229,There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .
6230,"Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive - office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . ''"
6231,"This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one - house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto ."
6232,The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .
6233,President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives .
6234,"If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes ."
6235,"What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo ."
6236,President Reagan learned that lesson .
6237,"By 1987 , then - Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II ."
6238,"If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable ."
6239,The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power .
6240,"However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution ."
6241,The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto .
6242,Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line - item veto .
6243,"As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line - item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives ."
6244,The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .
6245,"One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers ."
6246,There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .
6247,"If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won ."
6248,"If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court -LRB- assuming it can establish standing to sue -RRB- , President Bush might win ."
6249,"In that case , he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive ."
6250,"If President Bush loses at the court , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration ."
6251,But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now .
6252,"Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice ."
6253,"As it stands now , Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down ."
6254,President Bush should set things straight .
6255,"If he does not , he will help realize Madison 's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . ''"
6256,Mr. Sidak served as an attorney in the Reagan administration .
6257,His longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year .
6258,"Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record , net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $ 59.9 billion last year ."
6259,"The previous record was $ 57.7 billion in 1987 , according to the Agriculture Department ."
6260,"Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's Economic Research Service reported yesterday ."
6261,Most of those states set farm income records .
6262,The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains .
6263,What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price - support loan programs .
6264,"With prices soaring , they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at `` considerable profit , '' the agency 's 240 - page report said ."
6265,"In less parched areas , meanwhile , farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices ."
6266,"To the surprise of some analysts , net cash income rose in some of the hardest - hit states , including Indiana , Illinois , Nebraska and the Dakotas ."
6267,Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ 4 billion disaster - assistance package enacted by Congress .
6268,Last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s .
6269,It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year .
6270,"Commodity prices have been rising in recent years , with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year , as the government curtailed production with land - idling programs to reduce price - depressing surpluses ."
6271,"At the same time , export demand for U.S. wheat , corn and other commodities strengthened , said Keith Collins , a department analyst ."
6272,"Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices , as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30 - year low ."
6273,"`` All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture , '' Mr. Collins said ."
6274,"California led the nation with $ 6.5 billion in net cash income last year , followed by Texas , $ 3.9 billion ; Iowa , $ 3.4 billion ; Florida , $ 3.1 billion ; and Minnesota , $ 2.7 billion ."
6275,Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income .
6276,"Despite federal disaster relief , the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers , according to the department ."
6277,Many lost their farms .
6278,Department economists do n't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was .
6279,"Indeed , net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline ."
6280,"At the same time , an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn , soybeans and other commodities , causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets ."
6281,"Last year , government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ 14.5 billion from a record $ 16.7 billion in 1987 ."
6282,Payments are expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this year .
6283,"After years of struggling , the Los Angeles Herald Examiner will publish its last edition today , shut down by its parent , Hearst Corp. , following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper ."
6284,"The demise of the 238,000 - circulation Herald , once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000 , turns the country 's second - largest city into a one - newspaper town , at least in some senses ."
6285,"The Los Angeles Times , with a circulation of more than 1.1 million , dominates the region ."
6286,"But it faces stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register , which sells more than 300,000 copies a day , and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News , which sells more than 170,000 ."
6287,Nearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach also have large dailies .
6288,"In July , closely held Hearst , based in New York , put the paper on the block ."
6289,"Speculation had it that the company was asking $ 100 million for an operation said to be losing about $ 20 million a year , but others said Hearst might have virtually given the paper away ."
6290,"An attempted buy - out led by John J. McCabe , chief operating officer , never materialized , and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as `` tire - kickers and lookee - loos '' had filed through since ."
6291,The prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun .
6292,"The death of the Herald , a newsstand paper in a freeway town , was perhaps inevitable ."
6293,"Los Angeles is a sprawling , balkanized newspaper market , and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times , then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies ."
6294,The Herald was left in limbo .
6295,"Further , the Herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old - time Hearst readership -- blue - collar and sports - oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly , upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times ."
6296,Hearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan .
6297,"The Herald joins the Baltimore News - American , which folded , and the Boston Herald - American , which was sold , as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s ."
6298,"Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did , if marginally , because of its place in family history ."
6299,"Its fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan , who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon ."
6300,William Randolph Hearst had kept an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance - style building .
6301,Analysts said the Herald 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry .
6302,"`` The Herald was a survivor from a bygone age , '' said J. Kendrick Noble , a media analyst with PaineWebber Inc ."
6303,"`` Actually , the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end , and the industry looks pretty healthy . ''"
6304,"Founded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst , the Herald was crippled by a bitter , decade - long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half ."
6305,"Financially , it never recovered ; editorially , it had its moments ."
6306,"In 1979 , Hearst hired editor James Bellows , who brightened the editorial product considerably ."
6307,"He and his successor , Mary Anne Dolan , restored respect for the editorial product , and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources , its accomplishments were notable ."
6308,"For example , the Herald consistently beat its much - larger rival on disclosures about Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 's financial dealings ."
6309,The Herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded .
6310,"Robert J. Danzig , vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers , stood up in the paper 's newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold , putting more than 730 full - time employees out of work ."
6311,Hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days .
6312,"Some long - tenured employees will receive additional benefits , the company said ."
6313,"Hours after the announcement , representatives of the Orange County Register were in a bar across the street recruiting ."
6314,The reaction in the newsroom was emotional .
6315,"`` I 've never seen so many people crying in one place at one time , '' said Bill Johnson , an assistant city editor ."
6316,"`` So Long , L.A. '' was chosen as the paper 's final headline ."
6317,"`` I 'm doing the main story , and I 'm already two beers drunk , '' said reporter Andy Furillo , whom the Times hired away several years ago but who returned to the Herald out of preference ."
6318,"His wife also works for the paper , as did his father ."
6319,"Outside , a young pressman filling a news box with an extra edition headlined `` Herald Examiner Closes '' refused to take a reader 's quarter ."
6320,"`` Forget it , '' he said as he handed her a paper ."
6321,`` It does n't make any difference now .
6322,Olympia Broadcasting Corp. said it did n't make a $ 1.64 million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $ 23.4 million of senior subordinated debentures .
6323,The radio - station owner and programmer said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions .
6324,It said it needs to make the payment by Dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt .
6325,"In September , the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business ."
6326,"If you 'd really rather have a Buick , do n't leave home without the American Express card ."
6327,Or so the slogan might go .
6328,American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card .
6329,The companies are giving four - day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card .
6330,"They have begun sending letters explaining the program , which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18 , to about five million card holders ."
6331,Neither company would disclose the program 's cost .
6332,"Buick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a `` good credit history '' and are `` good at making payments , '' says a spokeswoman for the division ."
6333,"American Express also represents the upscale image `` we 're trying to project , '' she adds ."
6334,Buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as `` the doctor 's car '' -- a product for upscale professionals .
6335,"Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier , though industry sales fell ."
6336,"But since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1 , Buick sales have plunged 33 % ."
6337,"For American Express , the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales , where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business ."
6338,"Traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses ."
6339,"Phillip Riese , an American Express executive vice president , says the promotion with Buick is his company 's first with an auto maker , but `` hopefully -LCB- will be -RCB- the first of many '' in the company 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car - care card . ''"
6340,"To that end , American Express has been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card ."
6341,"Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card , but few card holders realize this , Mr. Riese says ."
6342,"Until now , however , buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth - in - lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates , says a spokesman for the GM finance arm ."
6343,"But GMAC approved the Buick program , he says , because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does n't carry any finance rates ."
6344,"Mr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick `` very sophisticated direct - mail marketers , '' so `` by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct - mail capability . ''"
6345,"In addition , Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders , says an American Express spokeswoman ."
6346,"When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases , Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars , the spokeswoman says ."
6347,"American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S. , and over half have the green card ."
6348,"GMAC screened the card - member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't `` missed any payments , '' the Buick spokeswoman says ."
6349,Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC .
6350,"These 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC 's advertised finance rates , which start at 6.9 % for two - year loan contracts ."
6351,"A spokesman for Visa International 's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie - in similar to the American Express - Buick link ."
6352,"Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion : the establishment services division , which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division ."
6353,"The vacation packages include hotel accommodations and , in some cases , tours or tickets to local attractions , but not meals ."
6354,"Destinations are Chicago ; Honolulu ; Las Vegas , Nev. ; Los Angeles ; Miami Beach , Fla. ; New Orleans ; New York ; Orlando , Fla. ; San Francisco ; and Washington , D.C."
6355,A buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on United Airlines .
6356,"In lieu of the vacation , buyers can choose among several prizes , including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder ."
6357,Card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes .
6358,"If they test - drive a Buick , they get an American Express calculator ."
6359,This is n't Buick 's first travel - related promotion .
6360,"A few years ago , the company offered two round - trip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car ."
6361,"The promotion helped Riviera sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than 10 % , Buick said at the time ."
6362,The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest - rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks .
6363,The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .
6364,As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities .
6365,An appeal is expected .
6366,"In response to the ruling , gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session ."
6367,"Gilts , or British government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower ."
6368,"The council , which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over # 6 billion -LRB- $ 9.5 billion -RRB- , lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals ."
6369,"At one point , Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest - rate swap dealings ."
6370,"When two parties engage in an interest - rate swap , they are betting against each other on future rates ."
6371,"Thus , an institution obligated to make fixed - rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating - rate payments ."
6372,"In most of the British transactions , the municipalities agreed to make floating - rate payments to banks , which would make fixed - rate payments ."
6373,"As interest rates rose , municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them ."
6374,"The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell , district auditor for Hammersmith , who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital - markets activities ."
6375,The council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal .
6376,"Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital - markets transactions , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils ."
6377,"`` While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith , it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature , '' a solicitor representing one of the banks said ."
6378,"Already , 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings ."
6379,"Other financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC , Midland Bank PLC , Security Pacific Corp. , Chemical Banking Corp. 's Chemical Bank , Citicorp 's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International ."
6380,"If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal , it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways , some market sources said ."
6381,Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils .
6382,Officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable .
6383,The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .
6384,Some Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years .
6385,"The funding mechanism , which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush , would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission ."
6386,"As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending , Congress cut by $ 30 million the Bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 , which began Oct. 1 ."
6387,"To offset the reduction , Congress approved a $ 20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions ."
6388,"Some Democrats , led by Rep. Jack Brooks -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- , unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts ."
6389,But Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them .
6390,"`` It could operate to augment our budget , '' James Rill , the Justice Department 's antitrust chief , said in an interview ."
6391,"Under measures approved by both houses of Congress , the administration 's request for $ 47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $ 15 million ."
6392,"The FTC budget request of $ 70 million , about $ 34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by $ 15 million ."
6393,The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989 .
6394,The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart - Scott - Rodino Act .
6395,"Under that law , parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ 15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions ."
6396,"Currently , the government charges nothing for such filings ."
6397,"Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that , based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year , the fees will yield at least $ 40 million this fiscal year , or $ 10 million more than the budget cuts ."
6398,"`` When you do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of $ 5 million '' each for the FTC and the Justice Department , Rep. Neal Smith -LRB- D. , Iowa -RRB- said during House debate ."
6399,"But Rep. Don Edwards -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- responded that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected ."
6400,"The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40 % in the Reagan administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period ."
6401,"`` Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen , '' Mr. Edwards argued ."
6402,Any money in excess of $ 40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large .
6403,Corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions .
6404,"Though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect , government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings ."
6405,FALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off - year elections .
6406,Odd - year elections attract relatively few ballot issues .
6407,"But the 1989 fall total of 80 , while well below 1988 activity , shows `` a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives , '' says Patrick McGuigan , editor of Family , Law and Democracy Report ."
6408,He says the 10 citizen - sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd - year this decade .
6409,Ballot questions range from a Maine initiative on banning Cruise missiles to a referendum on increasing the North Dakota income tax .
6410,Ballot watchers say attention already is focused on the 1990 elections .
6411,"In California , two petition drives for next year 's election are `` essentially finished , '' says David Schmidt , author of `` Citizen Lawmakers . ''"
6412,Mr. McGuigan cites three completed efforts in Oklahoma .
6413,"Hot ballot topics are expected to be abortion , the environment and insurance reform ."
6414,"Taking a cue from California , more politicians will launch their campaigns by backing initiatives , says David Magleby of Brigham Young University ."
6415,PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTING gains new stature as prices rise .
6416,Price records are being set at auctions this week .
6417,"At Christie 's , a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz 's `` Equivalents '' series sold for $ 396,000 , a single - lot record ."
6418,Other works also have been exceeding price estimates .
6419,"In part , prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints ."
6420,"This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal , says Beth Gates - Warren of Sotheby 's ."
6421,"`` There is finally some sort of sense in the market , '' she says ."
6422,"Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers , giving greater market stability , says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector ."
6423,"`` When I see prints going into the hands of institutions , I know they are n't going to come back on the market . ''"
6424,Most in demand : classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray .
6425,"But much contemporary work is also fetching `` a great deal of money , '' says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography ."
6426,DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services .
6427,"Currently a $ 300 million - a - year business , 900 telephone service is expected to hit $ 500 million next year and near $ 2 billion by 1992 as uses for the service continue to expand , says Joel Gross of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc ."
6428,"The service -- which costs the caller from 30 cents to $ 25 a minute -- currently is dominated by celebrity chatter , horoscopes and romance lines ."
6429,"But more serious applications are in the wings , and that is where the future growth is expected ."
6430,"`` I 'm starting to see more business transactions , '' says Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales , software tutorials and even service contracts ."
6431,"Colleges , she says , are eyeing registration through 900 service ."
6432,"Charities test the waters , but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising ."
6433,"`` The thing that will really break this market right open is merchandising , '' Ms. West says ."

6442,DIAPER SERVICES make a comeback amid growing environmental concerns .
6443,"Concerned about shrinking landfills and the safety of chemicals used in super-absorbent disposables , parents are returning to the cloth diaper ."
6444,"Tiny Tots Inc. , Campbell , Calif. , says business is up 35 % in the past year ."

6446,"In Syracuse , N.Y. , DyDee Service 's new marketing push stresses environmental awareness ."
6447,Among its new customers : day - care centers that previously spurned the service .
6448,"The National Association of Diaper Services , Philadelphia , says that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in starting diaper services ."
6449,"Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College , Pa. , where she lives , did n't have one ."
6450,"Diaper shortages this summer limited growth at Stork Diaper Services , Springfield , Mass. , where business is up 25 % in"

6454,"FreudToy , a pillow bearing the likeness of Sigmund Freud , is marketed as a $ 24.95 tool for do - it - yourself analysis ."
6455,"Program trading is `` a racket , '' complains Edward Egnuss , a White Plains , N.Y. , investor and electronics sales executive , `` and it 's not to the benefit of the small investor , that 's for sure . ''"
6456,"But although he thinks that it is hurting him , he doubts it could be stopped ."
6457,Mr. Egnuss 's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country .
6458,"But like Mr. Egnuss , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt it should be ."
6459,"`` I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , '' says Leo Fields , a Dallas investor ."
6460,"He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading ."
6461,But he blames program trading for only some of the market 's volatility .
6462,He also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds .
6463,"He adds : `` The market may be giving us another message , that a recession is looming . ''"
6464,"Or , as Dorothy Arighi , an interior decorator in Arnold , Calif. , puts it : `` All kinds of funny things spook the market these days . ''"
6465,But she believes that `` program trading creates deviant swings .
6466,It 's not a sound thing ; there 's no inherent virtue in it . ''
6467,She adds that legislation curbing it would be `` a darned good idea . ''
6468,"At the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta 's Buckhead district , a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading ."
6469,"Citing the October 1987 crash , Glenn Miller says , `` It 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . ''"
6470,"A. Donald Anderson , a 59 - year - old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie - jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading ."
6471,Those who still want to do it `` will just find some way to get around '' any attempt to curb it .
6472,"Similarly , Rick Wamre , a 31 - year - old asset manager for a Dallas real - estate firm , would like to see program trading disappear because `` I ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country . ''"
6473,Yet he is n't in favor of new legislation .
6474,"`` I think we 've got enough securities laws , '' he says ."
6475,`` I 'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit . ''
6476,"Peter Anthony , who runs an employment agency in New York , decries program trading as `` limiting the game to a few , '' but he also is n't sure it should be more strictly regulated ."
6477,"`` I do n't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism , '' he explains ."
6478,And surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading .
6479,"Glenn Britta , a 25 - year - old New York financial analyst who plays options for his personal account , says he is `` factoring '' the market 's volatility `` into investment decisions . ''"
6480,He adds that program trading `` increases liquidity in the market .
6481,You ca n't hold back technology . ''
6482,"And the practice should n't be stopped , he says , because `` even big players are n't immune to the rigors of program trading . ''"
6483,"Also in New York , Israel Silverman , an insurance - company lawyer , comments that program trading `` increases volatility , but I do n't think it should be banned ."
6484,There 's no culprit here .
6485,The market is just becoming more efficient . ''
6486,"Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets , he says ."
6487,"He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund , and volatility , on a given day , may hurt the fund ."
6488,"But `` I 'm a long - term investor , '' he says ."
6489,"`` If you were a short - term investor , you might be more leery about program trading . ''"
6490,Jim Enzor of Atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge .
6491,"`` If we have a real bad day , the program would say , ` Buy , ' '' he explains ."
6492,"`` If you could get the rhythm of the program trading , you could take advantage of it . ''"
6493,What else can a small investor do ?
6494,"Scott Taccetta , a Chicago accountant , is going into money - market funds ."
6495,"Mr. Taccetta says he had just recouped the $ 5,000 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13 ."
6496,"Now , he plans to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990 ."
6497,"In October , before the market dropped , Mrs. Arighi of Arnold , Calif. , moved to sell the `` speculative stocks '' in her family trust `` so we will be able to withstand all this flim - flammery '' caused by program trading ."
6498,She believes that the only answer for individuals is to `` buy stocks that 'll weather any storm . ''
6499,"Lucille Gorman , an 84 - year - old Chicago housewife , has become amazingly immune to stock - market jolts ."
6500,Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge .
6501,"`` My stocks are all blue chips , '' she says ."
6502,"`` If the market goes down , I figure it 's paper profits I 'm losing ."
6503,"On the other hand , if it goes way sky high , I always sell ."
6504,You do n't want to get yourself too upset about these things .
6505,"Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 's Bell Laboratories reported they raised the electrical current - carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100 , moving the materials closer to commercial use ."
6506,"The scientists said they created small changes in the crystal - lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field ."
6507,"The scientists said they made the advance with yttrium - containing superconductors cooled to liquid - nitrogen temperature , or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit ."
6508,Their report appears in today 's issue of the journal Nature .
6509,"The finding marks a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications ."
6510,"Scientists had obtained even higher current - carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors , but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry ."
6511,Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled .
6512,A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current - carrying capacity can be raised .
6513,The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current - carrying problem can be overcome .
6514,"But `` it wo n't lead to imminent use '' of new superconductors , cautioned Robert B. van Dover , one of the AT&T researchers ."
6515,He added that the current - carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so - called weak links between crystals .
6516,Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications .
6517,"Mr. van Dover said the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons , a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large - scale commercial use ."
6518,"Still , scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding , because it demonstrates how to overcome the `` flux pinning '' problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential ."
6519,"The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals , limiting their current - carrying capacity ."
6520,"Mr. van Dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from lowering current - carrying capacity ."
6521,Mr. van Dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem .
6522,Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal - lattice patterns .
6523,"The AT&T team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with `` melt - textured growth , '' a process discovered earlier at Bell Laboratories ."
6524,The combined processes may significantly raise the current - carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples .
6525,"Although his team lost the World Series , San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them ."
6526,He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park .
6527,"Small wonder , since he 's asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium ."
6528,"As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One , opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium ."
6529,A stadium craze is sweeping the country .
6530,It 's fueled by the increasing profitability of major - league teams .
6531,"Something like one - third of the nation 's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums , ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg ."
6532,Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city .
6533,Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that .
6534,He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out .
6535,"Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community , not create more of it ."
6536,Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium .
6537,San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago .
6538,"Last month , Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition ."
6539,"Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor , the Chamber of Commerce , the major media -- and spent $ 100,000 on promotion ."
6540,"But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself , and rejected it 59 % to 41 % ."
6541,"In San Francisco , its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls ."
6542,"George Christopher , the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s , wo n't endorse the new ballpark ."
6543,"He says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces ."
6544,"Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces , Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters ."
6545,Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built .
6546,"Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can prove it ."
6547,"Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city - owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds ."
6548,He did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
6549,"`` This stadium shows that anything government can do , we can do better , '' Mr. Robbie says ."
6550,"But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money - losing Superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance ."
6551,"`` The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said ."
6552,"`` It is the very building of it that is important , not how much of it is used or its economics . ''"
6553,An Egyptian Pharaoh could n't have justified his pyramids any better .
6554,But civilization has moved forward since then .
6555,"Today taxpayers get to vote , most of the time , on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions ."
6556,Wall Street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered .
6557,The reason : Risks from the firms ' new `` merchant banking '' activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes .
6558,"The downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc. , parent of First Boston Corp. , by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. , coupled with a Moody 's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage community this week ."
6559,With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably .
6560,"Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper , or short - term corporate IOUs , which they sell to finance their daily operations ."
6561,The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper .
6562,"But Moody 's warned that Shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a move that would reduce Shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms ."
6563,Shearson is 62 % - owned by American Express Co .
6564,"`` Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s , '' says Christopher T. Mahoney , a Moody 's vice president ."
6565,`` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . ''
6566,"Standard & Poor 's Corp. says First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead ."
6567,What worries credit - rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long - term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy - out and junk bond financings .
6568,That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors .
6569,"Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy - outs and junk bonds is resulting in long - term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years ."
6570,"`` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer - term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says Jeffrey Bowman , a vice president at S&P , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston ."
6571,"`` Wall Street is facing a Catch - 22 situation , '' says Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's ."
6572,"Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . ''"
6573,"In addition , he says , the buy - out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk - bond financings shrinks ."
6574,"In a leveraged buy - out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets ."
6575,"In a recent report , Moody 's said it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . ''"
6576,It said that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor . ''
6577,"Both Moody 's and S&P cited First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit ."
6578,"The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high - yield , high - risk junk financings for Campeau units ."
6579,"In addition , a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co . was n't repaid on time when its $ 450 million junk financing for a buy - out of the bedding company was withdrawn ."
6580,"`` These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity , '' Moody 's said ."
6581,`` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity . ''
6582,"CS First Boston , however , benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder , Credit Suisse , Switzerland 's third largest bank ."
6583,Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy - out business .
6584,"But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash ."
6585,"In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill ."
6586,"Shearson `` really only has $ 300 million of capital , '' says Mr. Bowman of S&P ."
6587,A Shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried .
6588,"`` A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade , '' he said ."
6589,"`` After two months of talks , our rating was maintained . ''"
6590,"Drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating ."
6591,"The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market ."
6592,The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider - trading scandal .
6593,"Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 ."
6594,"Recently , Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years ."
6595,"The firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say ."
6596,Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness .
6597,"`` We 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital , '' a Drexel spokesman said ."
6598,"`` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view ."
6599,"Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months ."
6600,"Lewis C. Veraldi , the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars , retired early after experiencing recent heart problems ."
6601,"Most recently , Mr. Veraldi , 59 years old , has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co ."
6602,But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car - development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top - selling nameplate in the U.S. .
6603,"Under the so - called Team Taurus approach , Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly - line workers , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle ."
6604,The concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands .
6605,"It was later applied to other new - car programs , including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar ."
6606,Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has `` helped to change the world 's perception of American - made cars . ''
6607,"Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years , holding a variety of car and parts - engineering positions ."
6608,The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm .
6609,We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who 've been hurt .
6610,"But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy - making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk , technology and innovation ."
6611,"Too often now , a single court decision becomes the precedent for other , less compelling cases ."
6612,"From the 1940s until 1971 , some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol -LRB- DES -RRB- to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness ."
6613,"The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , often under generic labels ."
6614,"In the 1970s , scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users ."
6615,"The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used ."
6616,"Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common - law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable ."
6617,"Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market - share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales ."
6618,This has some logic .
6619,Drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used .
6620,But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope .
6621,"Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties ."
6622,"The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v. Lilly , where the highest New York court expanded the market - share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages ."
6623,"But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California ."
6624,"Despite the Supreme Court 's refusal to hear the case , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants ."
6625,"The big problem , however , is that there 's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to DES or to drugs ."
6626,The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine .
6627,The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs .
6628,"The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs , citing the huge , hidden social costs ."
6629,"`` Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous court said ."
6630,"The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning - sickness drug , Bendectin , off the U.S. market ."
6631,This raises the key issue : What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ?
6632,We now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone .
6633,"As liability expert Peter Huber tells us , after the Hymowitz case , if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug `` it 's time to sell that company 's stock short . ''"
6634,"We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway ; some win the legal lottery , others get much less and contingency - fee lawyers take a big cut either way ."
6635,DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts .
6636,Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs .
6637,But a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation .
6638,Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion - dollar morass .
6639,We have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases .
6640,"They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody , but know it wo n't be done by Congress ."

6647,"A man from the Bush administration came before the House Agriculture Committee yesterday to talk about the U.S. 's intention to send some $ 100 million in food aid to Poland , with more to come from the EC ."
6648,The committee 's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland 's own farmers .
6649,Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt .
6650,"However well intentioned , food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country 's own farmers ."
6651,The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people 's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness .
6652,It should be constantly stressed that Poland 's farmers mostly need a real market for their products .

6686,"`` Unemployment continues at a relatively low level , providing a sense of job security , and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong . ''"

6695,"Despite a deluge of economic news , the Treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over International Business Machines Corp. 's huge debt offering ."
6696,"`` There were so many economic reports but the market did n't care about any of them , '' said Kathleen Camilli , a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc ."
6697,"`` So the focus turned to other fixed - income markets , corporate and mortgages in particular , '' she said ."
6698,"IBM , the giant computer maker , offered $ 750 million of non-callable 30 - year debentures priced to yield 8.47 % , or about 1/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30 - year Treasury bonds ."
6699,The size of IBM 's issue was increased from an originally planned $ 500 million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds .
6700,"In the investment - grade corporate market , `` it 's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features , '' said James Ednie , a Drexel industrial bond trader ."
6701,Money managers ranked IBM 's offering as the most significant investment - grade sale of the year because large issues of long - term debt by companies with triple - A credit are infrequent .
6702,"Syndicate officials at lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. said the debentures were snapped by up pension funds , banks , insurance companies and other institutional investors ."
6703,"In the Treasury market , investors paid scant attention to the day 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy ."
6704,"`` Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady , yesterday 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion , '' said Charles Lieberman , a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp ."
6705,The government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower .
6706,"Both indicators were viewed as signs that the nation 's industrial sector is growing very slowly , if at all ."
6707,A survey by the Federal Reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy .
6708,"In a monthly report prepared for use at the Fed 's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14. , the nation 's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks ."
6709,"Among other things , the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries ."
6710,"The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts , for example , reported declines in manufacturing activity while the Boston , Dallas and San Francisco banks noted that business expanded ."
6711,"The purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in October , although it remains below 50 % ."
6712,A reading below 50 % indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50 % suggests that the industry is expanding .
6713,Mr. Lieberman said the diverse showing in yesterday 's reports `` only enhances the importance of the employment data . ''
6714,"The employment report , which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices , is due out tomorrow ."
6715,"The average estimate of 22 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October ."
6716,The economists forecast a 0.1 % rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4 % .
6717,Treasury Securities
6718,"In a surprise announcement , the Treasury said it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30 - year bond rather than create a new one for next week 's quarterly refunding of the federal debt ."
6719,"The Treasury will raise $ 10 billion in fresh cash by selling $ 30 billion of securities , including $ 10 billion of new three - year notes and $ 10 billion of new 10 - year notes ."
6720,"But rather than sell new 30 - year bonds , the Treasury will issue $ 10 billion of 29year , nine - month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30 - year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in August ."
6721,"Credit market analysts said the decision to reopen the current benchmark , the 8 1/8 % bond due August 2019 , is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount ."
6722,"Some dealers said the Treasury 's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities , given uncertainties about when the auction will occur ."
6723,The Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling .
6724,"Until such action takes places , the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind ."
6725,"Meanwhile , Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading ."
6726,"The benchmark 30 - year bond about 1/4 point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount ."
6727,The benchmark was priced at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88 % compared with 102 12/32 to yield 7.90 % Tuesday .

6730,Corporate Issues
6731,IBM 's $ 750 million debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market .
6732,"Meanwhile , most investment - grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point higher ."
6733,"In its latest compilation of performance statistics , Moody 's Investors Service found that investment - grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7 % in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5 % ."
6734,Moody 's said those returns compare with a 3.8 % total return for longer - term Treasury notes and bonds .
6735,Total return measures price changes and interest income .
6736,"For the year to date , Moody 's said total returns were topped by the 16.5 % of longer - term Treasury issues , closely followed by 15 % for investment - grade bonds ."
6737,Junk bonds trailed the group again .
6738,"`` Even the 7.2 % return from the risk - free three - month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk bonds , '' wrote Moody 's economist John Lonski in yesterday 's market report ."
6739,"`` Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting , '' he said ."
6740,Moody 's said the average net asset value of 24 junk - bond mutual funds fell by 4.2 % in October .

6748,A $ 114 million issue of health facility revenue bonds from the California Health Facilities Financing Authority was temporarily withdrawn after being tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group .
6749,"An official for the lead underwriter declined to comment on the reason for the delay , but market participants speculated that a number of factors , including a lack of investor interest , were responsible ."
6750,"The issue could be relaunched , possibly in a restructured form , as early as next week , according to the lead underwriter ."
6751,"A $ 107.03 million offering of Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency , Calif. , tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels today , according to an official with lead underwriter Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp ."
6752,The Santa Ana bonds were tentatively priced to yield from 6.40 % in 1991 to 7.458 % in
6753,"Bucking the market trend , an issue of $ 130 million general obligation distributable state aid bonds from Detroit , Mich. , apparently drew solid investor interest ."
6754,They were tentatively priced to yield from 6.20 % in 1991 to 7.272 % in
6755,Foreign Bond
6756,West German dealers said there was little interest in Treasury bonds ahead of Thursday 's new government bond issue .
6757,"So far , they said , investors appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the government to raise the coupon to more than 7 % ."
6758,"It is generally expected to be the usual 10 - year , four billion mark issue ."
6759,"Rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue , or that the last Bund , a 7 % issue due October 1999 , would be increased by two billion marks ."
6760,Elsewhere :
6761,"-- In Japan , the benchmark No. 111 4.6 % issue due 1998 ended on brokers screens unchanged at 95.09 to yield 5.435 % ."

6766,The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC 's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd .

6768,"BTR PLC , a U.K. industrial conglomerate , said in June it had sold its National Tyre Service business to Michelin Investment Ltd. , a U.K. unit of the tire maker , for # 140 million -LRB- $ 221.4 million -RRB- ."

6772,"Rep. John Dingell , an important sponsor of President Bush 's clean - air bill , plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue : acid rain ."
6773,"The Michigan Democrat 's proposal , which is expected today , is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain ."
6774,"The administration 's plan could cost utilities , mainly those that use coal , up to $ 4 billion a year ."
6775,The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House 's work on clean - air legislation .
6776,"As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Mr. Dingell has almost single - handed control over clean - air legislation ."
6777,"People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven - million - ton cut in annual sulfur - dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could be ordered later ."
6778,Mr. Bush 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000 .
6779,"Although final details were n't available , sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the president 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur - dioxide emissions ."
6780,That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth .
6781,It also would junk an innovative market - based system for trading emissions credits among polluters .
6782,"In addition , it is believed to offer a cost - sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean - up costs for the dirtiest coal - fired utilities in the country , sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills ."
6783,"The administration , sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases , has staunchly opposed cost - sharing ."
6784,"Mr. Dingell 's staff was expected to present its acid - rain alternative to other committee members , apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high - polluting states who insist on cost - sharing ."
6785,"It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House 's acid - rain plan ."
6786,"While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner - burning fuels ."
6787,Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid - rain concerns .

6827,The March and May contracts rose to fresh life - of - contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day .

6832,"One analyst , Arthur Stevenson , of Prudential - Bache Securities , New York , estimated that 65 % or more of Brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline ."
6833,"`` This is a demand that must be met , regardless of the price of oil , '' said Mr. Stevenson ."
6834,Brazil is the third - largest producer and the fifth - largest exporter of sugar in the world .

6841,"More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production , according to Ms. Ganes ."
6842,"Also , there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane , and this change is being felt now , she said ."
6843,"Most important , Ms. Ganes noted , `` Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports . ''"
6844,"Thomas Oxnard , sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack , N.J. , said : `` I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports , particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound . ''"
6845,"Above all , Mr. Oxnard noted , the situation is extremely confused ."
6846,"`` Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , '' he said ."
6847,"`` It 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it . ''"
6848,Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated .
6849,"On the one hand , Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program ."
6850,"`` It has to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' Mr. Oxnard said ."
6851,"Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past two years , analysts said ."
6852,"Last year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted ."
6853,"This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said ."
6854,In other commodity markets yesterday :

6860,West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $ 20.07 .

6862,GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
6863,Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come .

6866,"As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat ."
6867,Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S. .
6868,"That designation would , among other things , provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain ."

6880,But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing .
6881,Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $ 313 million .
6882,It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska .
6883,"Younkers management is likely to buy a 10 % to 20 % interest in the chain in January , said Fred S. Hubbell , Equitable 's president and chief executive officer ."

6979,"`` Feeding Frenzy '' -LRB- Henry Holt , 326 pages , $ 19.95 -RRB- , a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal , begins on a reassuring note ."
6980,"Right up front in the preface , co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity ."
6981,"When offered a free trip from the Bronx , Wedtech 's home , to Washington , D.C. , by one of Wedtech 's principals , he tells the reader , `` mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about , I declined . ''"
6982,"Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive , high - minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers ."
6983,"Bribe by bribe , Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path Wedtech traveled , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full - fledged defense contractor , entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy ."
6984,"The book revolves around John Mariotta , the founder of the company , and Fred Neuberger , who became his partner soon after Wedtech 's creation ."
6985,"Although started in 1965 , Wedtech did n't really get rolling until 1975 , when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government 's Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- minority business program ."
6986,"This is a Johnson - era , Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses ."
6987,"Mr. Neuberger realized that , although of Italian ancestry , Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico ."
6988,The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation .
6989,"Instead of 50 / 50 it became , on paper only , two - thirds Mariotta , one - third Neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races ."
6990,"Besides being a `` minority - owned company '' Wedtech was located in the South Bronx , a blighted area , made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign ."
6991,The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s .
6992,"Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi -LRB- now serving a jail sentence -RRB- , the company began a career of bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to and including E. Robert Wallach , close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese ."
6993,Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery .
6994,"It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger ."
6995,"When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime ."
6996,Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company .
6997,Wedtech management used the merit system .
6998,"If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity ."
6999,"If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority '' person ."
7000,"But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy - to - read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' often falls short of gripping reading ."
7001,None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job .
7002,Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up .
7003,"The scammers themselves were garden - variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes ."
7004,"Among the lot of them , not one is wrestling with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane ."
7005,"The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack ."
7006,"He enters the story toward the end , just in time to get arrested ."
7007,"Absorbed in doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , namely the Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place ."
7008,They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ''
7009,Programs like Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up .
7010,"Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech ."
7011,They take place in government programs that seem tailor - made for corruption .
7012,Why are programs like this not eliminated ?
7013,`` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues .
7014,In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party .
7015,"They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government ."
7016,They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .
7017,How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?
7018,This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal .
7019,"Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp. , 1983 - 85 ."
7020,Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .
7021,"The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share ."
7022,Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
7023,The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30 - day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .
7024,"Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300 - day estimate ."
7025,"First Chicago Corp. said it completed its $ 55.1 million cash - and - stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp. , another Chicago bank holding company ."
7026,The record corn - buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline .
7027,The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships .
7028,River barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a year earlier .
7029,Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business .
7030,And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets .
7031,"The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October , which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. ."
7032,"The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January , which would be a strain in most years ."
7033,"But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River , on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas ."
7034,"`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said William Dunton , a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert ."
7035,`` It is going to be real tight . ''
7036,"Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time ."
7037,"In a few weeks , many barges probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River , which feeds into the Mississippi River ."
7038,The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it .
7039,Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation .
7040,But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month .
7041,"At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed , an Army Corps spokesman said ."
7042,Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years .
7043,"So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade ."
7044,Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers .
7045,At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel .
7046,Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought .
7047,"With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver ."
7048,Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices .
7049,"Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise ."
7050,"In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn ."
7051,"Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel , said Lyle Reed , president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa ."
7052,"It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game ."
7053,"Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one - fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins ."
7054,Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation .
7055,"`` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director ."
7056,"Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger - than - normal amount of corn by train to the port ."
7057,Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans .
7058,"One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore ."
7059,And it is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace .
7060,The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays .
7061,The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall .
7062,But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .
7063,In other commodity markets yesterday :
7064,"ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil ."
7065,"Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market ."

7069,PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets .
7070,December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 .
7071,December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 .
7072,January platinum was down $ 5.70 an ounce at $ 494.50 .
7073,"Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William O'Neill , vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York ."
7074,"`` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said ."
7075,"Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , he said ."
7076,"Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , he said ."
7077,"Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange , he said ."
7078,"Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman ."
7079,COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered Monday 's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike .
7080,The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14 .
7081,"In Chile , workers at two copper mines , Los Bronces and El Soldado , which belong to the Exxon - owned Minera Disputada , yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow , an analyst said ."
7082,"Reasons for the walkout , the analyst said , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike ."
7083,The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks .
7084,"In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal ."
7085,"Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted , was a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold ."
7086,The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago 's October index rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below 50 % .
7087,The September index was 47.1 % .
7088,"A reading below 50 % generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy , while a reading above 50 % points to expansion ."
7089,The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50 % .
7090,NCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers .
7091,The new software is based on Novell Inc. 's NetWare network operating system software .

DiLoreto , president of metal container division , was named to the additional post of group vice president , packaging products , at this packaging , industrial and aerospace products concern , succeeding Delmont A. Davis , who was named president and chief operating officer in August ."
7095,Two leading constitutional - law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line - item veto .
7096,"Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line - item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents ."
7097,A line - item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure .
7098,Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure .
7099,A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line - item veto to provoke a test case .
7100,"But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line - item veto . ''"
7101,The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
7102,"The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures ."
7103,"Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line - item veto ."
7104,"They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line - item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president ."
7105,"Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line - item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval ."
7106,Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago .
7107,Terms were n't disclosed .
7108,Trinity said it plans to begin delivery in the first quarter of next year .
7109,"Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings - and - loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts ."
7110,"The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC - owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget ."
7111,"The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization ."
7112,"`` Such agency ` self - help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor ."
7113,The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC .
7114,This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit .
7115,"Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates ."
7116,"But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately ."
7117,"That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years ."
7118,"`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC ."
7119,"The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes ."
7120,"Absent other working capital , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets ."
7121,"`` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said ."
7122,The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight .
7123,The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time .
7124,"Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds ."
7125,"But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's working - capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed ."
7126,"`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said ."
7127,`` The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ''
7128,The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .
7129,We 're about to see if advertising works .
7130,"Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190 - point stock - market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine ."
7131,"Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market , as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October"
7132,"Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors ."
7133,"This time around , they 're moving even faster ."
7134,PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .
7135,"Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today ."
7136,Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads .
7137,It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday .
7138,"Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were plotting out potential new ad strategies ."
7139,"The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic ."
7140,"This time , the firms were ready ."
7141,"Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge ."
7142,"When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers ."
7143,"The ads touted Fidelity 's automated 800 - number beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call . ''"
7144,"A Fidelity spokesman says the 800 - line , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend ."
7145,"`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says ."
7146,`` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .
7147,It would have been too late to think about on Friday .
7148,We had to think about it ahead of time . ''
7149,"Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity ."
7150,"Underneath the headline `` Diversification , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . ''"
7151,It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name .
7152,PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .
7153,"In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in - house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night ."
7154,It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last - minute creations .
7155,"The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish ."
7156,"Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... ."
7157,We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long - term appreciation . ''
7158,The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night .
7159,"PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks ."
7160,"Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market ."
7161,"`` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising ."
7162,"`` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . ''"
7163,"He adds , `` This is n't 1987 revisited . ''"
7164,"With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach ."
7165,"At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon ."
7166,"The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's easy - to - film , black - and - white `` Where We Stand '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 ."
7167,"The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` Leadership by Example . ''"
7168,"But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock - market ad ."
7169,`` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said .
7170,"The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait - and - see attitude , '' says Cathleen B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing ."
7171,"In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 ."
7172,But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .
7173,"In 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse ."
7174,Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .
7175,Ad Notes ... .
7176,ARNOLD ADVERTISING :
7177,"Edward Eskandarian , former chairman of Della Femina , McNamee WCRS / Boston , reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising , a small Boston shop ."
7178,Terms were n't disclosed .
7179,"Mr. Eskandarian , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold ."
7180,"John Verret , the agency 's president and chief executive , will retain the title of president ."
7181,"Separately , McDonald 's Corp. , Oak Brook , Ill. , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ 4 million cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn. , area ."
7182,"That account had been handled by Della Femina , McNamee WCRS ."
7183,EDUCATION ADS :
7184,A 142 - page ad supplement to Business Week 's special `` Corporate Elite '' issue calls on business leaders to use their clout to help solve the nation 's education crisis .
7185,"The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and kicks off a two - year Business Week initiative on education ."
7186,The magazine will distribute 10 % of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers .
7187,"You know what the law of averages is , do n't you ?"
7188,"It 's what 1 -RRB- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than Bo Jackson ; 2 -RRB- cautions that it 's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep ; and 3 -RRB- predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes ."
7189,"Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend ."
7190,"The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home - team Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year 's tournament ."
7191,"Morever , much of the damage was accomplished by A 's who had some catching up to do ."
7192,"In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach ."
7193,"He hit a 2 - 0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left - field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2 - 1 to a decisive 5 - 1 , where it stayed ."
7194,"So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular - season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup ."
7195,"`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later remarked ."
7196,"On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts ."
7197,"Mark McGwire , the big , red - haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five - game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1 - for - 17 ."
7198,"The A - men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5 - 0 decision ."
7199,Right - hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger .
7200,"That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21 - 9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split - fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week ."
7201,"The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest ."
7202,"`` Every guy they put out there had a better split - finger than the guy before , '' marveled Giant manager Roger Craig ."
7203,"He 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat ."
7204,The upshot of the downshoot is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best - of - seven fest .
7205,The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that took 2 - 0 Series leads went on to win it all .
7206,That 's not an average to soothe Giant rooters .
7207,"One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` Desire , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm ."
7208,"Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000 - plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see ."
7209,A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams .
7210,"`` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday ."
7211,I love 'em both .
7212,"The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games , '' said David Williams , a Sacramento septuagenarian , at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go ."
7213,The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility .
7214,"I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else ."
7215,"Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees - Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets ."
7216,"Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for ."
7217,"In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy - looking , second - year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery ."
7218,"He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game two -RRB- , moved a runner along in the A 's three - run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally ."
7219,"Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph ."
7220,Not his autograph ; power - hitter McGwire 's .
7221,"An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot - cold equation ."
7222,"He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3 - for - 3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run ."
7223,"`` When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured ."
7224,"The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters ."
7225,"They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs ."
7226,"They went a collective 5 - for - 24 here , with zero homers and ribbies ."
7227,"It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come ."
7228,"`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two ."
7229,`` I 'd rather see a so - so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold . ''
7230,But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side .
7231,"`` When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said ."
7232,`` That 's baseball .
7233,"Concerning your Sept. 19 article `` Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world ."
7234,"If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ?"
7235,"Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ?"
7236,"That should stop a lot of account - churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense ."
7237,"Now , would n't that be a novelty ."
7238,"Phyllis Kyle Stephenson Newport News , Va ."
7239,"Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at 5 a.m. , two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting ."
7240,"At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis Palamara did n't reach the office until 5:30 a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home ."
7241,"`` I had calls all night long from the States , '' he said ."
7242,"`` I was woken up every hour -- 1:30 , 2:30 , 3:30 , 4:30 ."
7243,"People are looking for possible opportunities to buy , but nobody wants to stick their chin out . ''"
7244,"For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that started nervously in the small hours ."
7245,"By lunchtime , the selling was at near - panic fever ."
7246,"But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street - inspired rally , the City breathed a sigh of relief ."
7247,So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district .
7248,"In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered especially vulnerable ."
7249,"And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be ."
7250,"By the time trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. , the news from Asia was in ."
7251,And it left mixed signals for London .
7252,Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less - than - alarming 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading .
7253,"At Jefferies ' trading room on Finsbury Circus , a stately circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ."
7254,"Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks ."
7255,"Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at 2076.8 , off 157.1 points , or 7 % ."
7256,"`` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said Mr. Palamara , a big , good - humored New York native who runs the 15 - trader office ."
7257,"The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles - based firm , played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk ."
7258,"`` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , '' said David Smith , who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks ."
7259,`` We tend to run a very tight book . ''
7260,"Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers ."
7261,"`` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & Newcastle , B.A.T , DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted this morning , '' Mr. Smith said ."
7262,"Seconds later , a 7,500 - share `` sell '' order for Scottish & Newcastle came in ."
7263,"For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no - smoking area to have a cigarette ."
7264,"On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 ."
7265,"`` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said ."
7266,"He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes ."
7267,"The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence , -LRB- $ 13.27 -RRB- and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out feelers ."
7268,"But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence ."
7269,"`` When I want to buy , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. Smith said ."
7270,`` It 's very frustrating . ''
7271,He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares .
7272,"By this time , it was 4:30 a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break ."
7273,"`` Fundamentally dangerous ... , '' Mr. Smith said , almost in a whisper , `` ... . fundamentally weak ... fairly vulnerable still ... extremely dangerously poised ..."
7274,we 're in for a lot of turbulence ... . ''
7275,He was right .
7276,"By midday , the London market was in full retreat ."
7277,"`` It 's falling like a stone , '' said Danny Linger , a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange ."
7278,Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby .
7279,Conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television .
7280,"At 12:49 p.m. , the index hit its low , 2029.7 , off 204.2 points ."
7281,"`` France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could calculate the index , which you could n't , '' Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said early in the afternoon ."
7282,"`` Spain is down 10 % and suspended , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % ."
7283,This market has been very badly damaged . ''
7284,"As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- neared , Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open ."
7285,"In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes ."
7286,They saw an opportunity created by the sell - off .
7287,"As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC , Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them to resell in the U.K ."
7288,Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar .
7289,"Suddenly , after about 45 minutes , the U.S. markets rallied ."
7290,"`` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted one trader at about 3:15 London time , as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout ."
7291,"As Wall Street strengthened , the London trading room went wild ."
7292,Traders shouted as their screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on Wall Street .
7293,"Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day ."

7302,The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy - outs of major U.S. airlines .
7303,"The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday ."
7304,"The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged ."
7305,"The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines ."
7306,"In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal ."
7307,"Elaine Chao , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . ''"
7308,Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . ''
7309,He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is `` wiggle room '' in the administration 's position .
7310,Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .
7311,But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .
7312,Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation .
7313,"`` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide ."
7314,The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy - out .
7315,"Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit ."
7316,"Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline - acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry ."
7317,"In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30 - day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired ."
7318,It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .
7319,"The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy - out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy - out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest ."
7320,"If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days ."
7321,"All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost - effective service ."
7322,"But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock - market plunge ."
7323,One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin - off companies .
7324,"In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members , a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow ."
7325,"`` It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , '' said Doug Hammond , the mediator , who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations ."
7326,"`` We 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , '' a Boeing spokesman said ."
7327,"The Machinists union has rejected a three - year contract offer that would have provided a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus some bonuses ."
7328,"Currently , average pay for machinists is $ 13.39 an hour , Boeing said ."
7329,"Now in its 13th day , the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners ."
7330,"With a strike fund of about $ 100 million , the union had said it was prepared for a long strike ."
7331,"After the third week on strike , union members will begin receiving $ 100 a week from the fund ."
7332,Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines .
7333,"And at the company 's Wichita , Kan. , plant , about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working , Boeing said ."
7334,"Under Kansas right - to - work laws , contracts can not require workers to be union members ."
7335,"Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant Renton , Wash. , plant ."
7336,Union officials could n't be reached for comment .
7337,U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute - settlement panel set up under the U.S. - Canadian `` free trade '' agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord .
7338,Mrs. Hills said the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute .
7339,"If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. fish - processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest ."
7340,"However , in Ottawa , Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute - settlement panel accepted the `` legitimacy of Canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries . ''"
7341,"Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel 's report , an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal . ''"
7342,The U.S. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions .
7343,Canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in British Columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export .
7344,This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds .
7345,Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the dispute - settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument .
7346,"`` We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel 's ruling '' that the `` landing requirement '' also must be ended , she said ."
7347,"Earlier , an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish - export restrictions violated GATT rules ."
7348,Mrs. Hills said the U.S. wo n't accept any delays after Nov. 13 because U.S. fish - processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch .
7349,She said the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded .

7360,The market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch -- yet .
7361,"Individual investors , investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive ; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans ."
7362,But several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties .
7363,"`` We 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary , '' said one official at a Top 10 bank ."
7364,"`` That 's good news , because we all swim in this water . ''"
7365,"Added another executive at a big bank : `` We were all a little goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen -LCB- Monday -RCB- , but it 's been very quiet ."
7366,"Now , as for tomorrow , hell , who knows ?"
7367,What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices .
7368,No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
7369,But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
7370,"After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose ."
7371,"The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours ."
7372,"The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels ."
7373,It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .
7374,A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself .
7375,But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
7376,What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds .
7377,"The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index ."
7378,Options markets stopped trading in many securities .
7379,"The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open ."
7380,"With nowhere else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange ."
7381,"As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply ."
7382,"Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense ."
7383,"At 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened ."
7384,"Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at 3:45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines ."
7385,"At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange ."
7386,"It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively ."
7387,Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
7388,It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .
7389,"To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none ."
7390,"Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions ."
7391,It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open .
7392,Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250 - point decline .
7393,The need for hurried last - minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets .
7394,"The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open ."
7395,The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies .
7396,"Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -LRB- which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock - index markets -RRB- be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary ."
7397,"In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago ."
7398,The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day .
7399,"Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions ."
7400,"-LRB- Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices ."
7401,Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders . -RRB-

7415,"More taunting in the parking lot , the players said , led to a fight ."
7416,The fan said he was punched and kicked by one player and that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat .

7435,"HOME - SALE LOSSES rise , but they 're often covered by employers ."
7436,But they search for ways to limit the damage .

7438,About 72 % reimburse for all or some losses .
7439,"Since 1984 , more companies give sales - loss aid , as many real - estate values depreciated , the council says ."

7448,"They said the exchange 's trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other exchanges could n't have performed better ."
7449,"`` We had no operating problems at all , '' Mr. Phelan said after the market closed ."
7450,"`` All the things that we set up to slow down the process , to let people know that the market was in an extreme position , worked extremely well . ''"
7451,"Prices for the 416.3 million shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange 's trading tape with barely a delay , officials said ."

7453,The so - called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day .
7454,"Despite traders ' complaints , Mr. Phelan said the links with the Chicago futures market worked as planned in Friday 's rout to provide a cooling - off period ."
7455,"Of greater help , the Big Board chairman said , was the `` natural circuit breaker '' of the weekend , that provided a breathing period that `` brought rationality back to the market ."
7456,Chicken Chains Ruffled By Loss of Customers
7457,"FAST - FOOD chicken chains , faced with a worsening business slump , are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies ."
7458,"The Crest Report , which tracks consumer purchases , says customer traffic at chicken restaurants fell 10 % in the second quarter , while the overall fast - food customer count was down 2 % ."
7459,"Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery - store convenience food , home - delivered pizza and other takeout fare , says a spokesman for the report , a publication of NPD Group , a market research firm in Port Washington , N.Y ."
7460,The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems .
7461,"Church 's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeye 's Famous Fried Chicken Inc. , which have merged , are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations ."
7462,"Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald 's Corp. , which introduced its McChicken sandwich this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken ."
7463,"New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. , has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd ."
7464,"And the chain is testing products that are n't fried , such as `` char - grilled '' chicken , to try to win health - conscious consumers ."
7465,"Kentucky Fried Chicken also is testing home - delivery of chicken , which could be a hit with stay - at - home diners ."
7466,But some fast - food industry analysts say problems with keeping chicken warm and fresh must be solved first .
7467,"A Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman , however , disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued ."
7468,"He says the test is continuing in Chicago , Columbus , Ohio , and a few other cities ."
7469,The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that Kentucky Fried Chicken will drop Young & Rubicam and seek a new ad agency .

7473,Reluctant Advertisers Try Soft - Sell Spots
7474,CALL IT un-advertising .
7475,Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet shun pushy ads .
7476,His ploy : 60 - second radio spots that offer helpful hints .
7477,The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot .
7478,"The messages resemble the Business Traveler , a daily dose of travel tips developed by Mr. Bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities ."
7479,"New un-advertisers include Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates , a Butler , Pa. , architectural firm ."
7480,Its radio series features such spots as `` Floodlights : Evening Wear for Urban Structures '' and `` Building a Place to Park . ''
7481,"A harder sell , says John Kosar , the firm 's president , would `` detract from the profession . ''"
7482,"Hospitals have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers , and Equitable Gas Co. is considering the format to offer energy tips to consumers ."
7483,But such spots can be too soft .
7484,"`` There 's always a risk of lost messages , '' says John Fitzgerald , chairman of Ketchum Advertising USA , which created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank ."
7485,`` It 's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition . ''
7486,Retailer Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push
7487,HERE 'S a retailer that 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products .
7488,"Big Bear Supermarkets Inc. , a grocery chain based in San Diego , plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment ."
7489,The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition and will include products like Murphy 's Oil Soap and other noncorrosive cleaners .
7490,But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements .
7491,"For example , it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts Sunlight on its environmentally safe list ."
7492,"That does n't thrill Procter & Gamble Co. , maker of Cascade dishwasher detergent ."
7493,"A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list , noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents ."
7494,"In fact , Lever Bros. confirms that its Sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach , even though it is n't listed on the label for the powder version ."
7495,"Thomas G. Dahlen , Big Bear 's executive vice president , said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems ."
7496,"`` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , '' he says ."
7497,`` And it 's important that we be accurate . ''
7498,"But in the end , customers ' wishes are what will prevail ."
7499,"Big Bear does n't care for disposable diapers , which are n't biodegradable ."
7500,Yet parents demand them .
7501,"Says Mr. Dahlen , `` We 'll still be forced to sell items we might not philosophically agree with . ''"
7502,Odds and Ends

7504,A study by Safeway 's Scanner Marketing Research shows soap sales climbed 5 % when bars were neatly stacked on shelves instead of dumped in a wire basket ... .
7505,Which celebrity endorsers are most believable ?
7506,"For the third year in a row , consumers voted Bill Cosby first and James Garner second in persuasiveness as spokesmen in TV commercials , according to Video Storyboard Tests , New York ."
7507,Michael J. Fox replaced Bruce Willis in third place ; Cher placed fourth for the second time .
7508,"Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has chosen Antonia Novello to be the next surgeon general , Bush administration officials said ."
7509,"If she is nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate , Dr. Novello would succeed C. Everett Koop , who rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues ."
7510,"Dr. Novello , an expert on pediatric kidney diseases , is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ."
7511,She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune deficiency syndrome .
7512,"Dr. Novello 's office said she would n't talk with reporters , and it refused to release any information about her ."
7513,"The newsletter Medicine & Health , which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan , said she is 44 years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine ."
7514,The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork - barrel politics .
7515,"Nevertheless , lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders -LRB- NAHB -RRB- continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special - interest spending ."
7516,"Kent Colton , NAHB executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first - time buyers , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . ''"
7517,There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending .
7518,But the NAHB was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production .
7519,"Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition , pushing for such initiatives as the balanced - budget amendment ."
7520,"Yet on matters close to , er , home ..."
7521,"`` The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70 % since 1980 , '' argues Mr. Colton ."
7522,`` We 've taken more than our fair share .
7523,I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . ''
7524,But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs .
7525,It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures .
7526,"Moreover , explains one HUD official , the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production ."
7527,"The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish - list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually ."
7528,"It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 ; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- FHA down - payment requirements and increase the availability of variable - rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- FmHA -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low - income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and localities ; and `` fully fund '' the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million potpourri for the homeless ."
7529,"Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well - connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen ."
7530,"Indirect subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better ."
7531,"Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low - income -RRB- to the single - family home market would result in a major expense ."
7532,"More important , housing programs run by HUD , the VA , and FmHA are awash in red ink ."
7533,"The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion ."
7534,The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended .
7535,"All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgages ."
7536,"In its nicely produced publication `` Where Will Our Children Live ? '' the NAHB does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government . ''"
7537,"It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low - and middle - income people ."
7538,"But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls ."
7539,"The association , a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business lobbies ."
7540,Explains Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union : `` It treads in two worlds .
7541,"The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the balanced - budget amendment . ''"
7542,"Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility ."
7543,"Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing bill , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition , '' says Ms. MacDonald ."
7544,As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... .
7545,The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ''
7546,More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies .
7547,Is this what the home builders want ?

7550,"In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency , EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the EC 's founding Treaty of Rome ."
7551,"According to diplomatic sources in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg , France , on Dec. 8 and 9 ."
7552,"The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who is opposed to creating a single EC currency ."
7553,But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity .
7554,"Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push ."
7555,"French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June , but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ."
7556,Diplomatic sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to EC unity .
7557,The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke T. Boone Pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade .
7558,"When asked `` What went wrong ? '' the unfortunate victim replied , `` It was a combination of things . ''"
7559,And so it was on Gray Friday .
7560,The grand marshal of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage .
7561,"Even if that is so , however , it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout -LRB- e -RRB- ."
7562,The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy - out was collapsing .
7563,"Although the union - bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high - leverage takeover deals is ending ."
7564,"Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling Federal Reserve tightness ; and the Bush administration 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital - gains tax ."
7565,"As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that ever - present marching band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write ."
7566,"What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is drying up ."
7567,"Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly margined investments in the `` deal '' stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing ."
7568,Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses .
7569,"UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close ."
7570,"AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close ."
7571,-LRB- Both took further hits yesterday . -RRB-
7572,Hilton lost 20 % on Friday ; Paramount lost almost 11 % .
7573,"A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured , the target 's stock price was not affected on Friday ."
7574,"The multibillion - dollar prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and / or issue billions in high - yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated ."
7575,The market for so - called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks .
7576,"The growing financial difficulties of recent high - leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high - yield securities ."
7577,Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk - bond sale and restructuring .
7578,"As a result , high - yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year - end are experiencing anxious times ."
7579,"These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen is the market reining them in ."
7580,"Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday ."
7581,"If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ?"
7582,"After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators ."
7583,Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's bashing of Wall Street ?
7584,Absolutely not .
7585,"To the extent that Friday 's sell - off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior ."
7586,The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings .
7587,The recent difficulties in the junk - bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .
7588,"If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions ."
7589,"Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year ."
7590,"Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites ."
7591,"The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily ."
7592,"If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington ."
7593,"If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated ."
7594,"The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics ."
7595,"Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm ."
7596,"Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general ."
7597,"Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end ."
7598,"Mr. Jarrell , former top economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission , teaches at the University of Rochester 's Simon Business School ."
7599,"Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38 ."
7600,"The index slid 647.33 points , or 1.8 % , on Monday ."
7601,"In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday 's trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 points , to 35133.83 ."
7602,"By 10 a.m. Tokyo time , the index was up 435.11 points , to 34903.80 as investors hailed New York 's overnight rally ."
7603,Monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets .
7604,"Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York ."
7605,"Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo , but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash ."
7606,All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since Friday 's 190.58 - point plunge on Wall Street .
7607,"But rather than set the tone for other markets , Japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines ."
7608,"Still , despite the sudden reappearance of stock - market turbulence , managers of Japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload U.S. or European equities ."
7609,"`` We did n't trade much today , as our policy now is to wait and see , '' said a fund manager at Taisho Life Insurance Co ."
7610,`` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . ''
7611,"The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that ."
7612,"But in the absence of panicky trading , its presence was never overtly felt ."
7613,"At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69 , down 647.33 points , or 1.8 % ."
7614,"The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank 45.66 , or 1.7 % , to 2600.88 ."
7615,The day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions .
7616,"Declining issues swamped advancers , 941 - 105 ."
7617,"But volume was thin at 526.2 million shares , compared with 574.7 million Friday ."
7618,"The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes ."
7619,"A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day 's low ."
7620,The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year .
7621,"The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96 , or 2.7 % , to 3655.40 ."
7622,"Many investors , trying to outperform the market 's major indexes , have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks ."
7623,Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply .
7624,"But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago , during the October 1987 global stock market crash ."
7625,"On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop ."
7626,"This time , Wall Street 's plunge of 6.9 % Friday was followed by yesterday 's 1.8 % loss in Tokyo ."
7627,"Two years ago , Tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after New York 's 22.6 % Black Monday plunge , when the Nikkei average fell 14.9 % ."
7628,"Thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street 's opening ."
7629,"But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market ."
7630,"Nobuto Yasuda , a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co. , called yesterday 's session `` a good scenario '' for Japan ."
7631,"`` Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders , '' he said ."
7632,"`` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . ''"
7633,"Isao Ushikubo , general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic ."
7634,He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a `` fleeting '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .
7635,"`` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time to buy , as was the case two years ago , '' he said ."
7636,"`` Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . ''"
7637,Other fund managers were similarly sanguine .
7638,"`` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said Masato Murakami , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co ."
7639,He said Friday 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy .
7640,"Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore 's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10 % ."
7641,Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong .
7642,"Bangkok , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses ."
7643,Brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy - outs and a deteriorating junk - bond market .
7644,"`` It 's pure psychology , '' said William Au Yeung , an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- HK -RRB- Ltd. in Hong Kong ."
7645,"`` Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy - outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead . ''"
7646,Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows .
7647,"Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China ."
7648,"`` Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , '' said Elizabeth Hambrecht , a regional analyst with Baring Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd ."
7649,"She pointed out that even after Monday 's 10 % decline , the Straits Times index is up 24 % this year , so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably ."
7650,"Similarly , Kuala Lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended 27.5 % above its 1988 close ."
7651,"In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70 ."
7652,"Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with 473.9 million Friday ."
7653,"But the session was orderly , in contrast to the market 's four - day closure after the 1987 crash ."
7654,"Richard Chenevix - Trench , a director at Hong Kong - based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd. , said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close ."
7655,"`` If New York does n't collapse , I see maybe another 5 % on the downside , not counting the risk of bad news out of China , '' he said ."
7656,"In Australia , Sydney 's All Ordinaries index closed at 1601.5 , down 8.1 % , its biggest drop since October 1987 ."
7657,But volume rose only to 162 million shares from 143 million Friday .
7658,"Nestor Hinzack , an analyst at brokerage firm Burdett , Buckeridge & Young Ltd. , described the market 's performance as `` sheep - like '' as investors fled to bluechip Australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price ."
7659,"London 's Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 - share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of 2163.4 , down 70.5 , or 3.2 % ."
7660,"At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than 130 points ."
7661,The Financial Times 30 - share index closed 79.3 points lower at 1738.7 .
7662,Volume more than doubled to 959.3 million shares from 457.7 million Friday .
7663,Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading .
7664,"The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points , or 12.8 % , to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever ."
7665,"Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue - chip shares down as much as 20 % ."
7666,"Analysts cited memories of two years ago , when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline steeply for the next three months ."
7667,"Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva ."
7668,"To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 ."
7669,The percentage change is since year - end .
7670,"Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California ."
7671,"We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la - la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place ."
7672,What else is one to make of the whacky save - the - earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ?
7673,"If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty ."
7674,"The initiative is based largely on the wish - lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment ."
7675,"Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one ."
7676,Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed .
7677,The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards .
7678,Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market .
7679,"In other words , California is presuming to take control of the nation 's farm policy ."
7680,As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality .
7681,Consider the greenhouse - effect provision .
7682,The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .
7683,"Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem ."
7684,"But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?"
7685,The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit .
7686,The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp .
7687,He 's running for governor .
7688,"Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 ."
7689,That 's also the day of the gubernatorial election .
7690,The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money .
7691,And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits .
7692,He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is gravy .
7693,"This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback ."
7694,"-LRB- The Republican candidate , Sen. Pete Wilson , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his own crime initiative . -RRB-"
7695,"While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through ."
7696,This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative .
7697,"If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly ."
7698,The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like .
7699,That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
7700,"Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple - pie issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric ."
7701,Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves .
7702,"George Bush , for example , may decide that he does n't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California ."
7703,And some other segments of California 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .
7704,"This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la - la activists want to take it ."
7705,"First , there was a death watch ."
7706,Then exhilaration .
7707,"Spurred by waves of large - scale buying in blue - chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58 - point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 ."
7708,"It was the fourth - biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash ."
7709,"While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987 - style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big - stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain - hunting institutions and program traders ."
7710,"A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over - the - counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge ."
7711,The Nasdaq OTC index closed down 6.31 to 460.98 .
7712,"Meanwhile , in a divergence in two of the market 's most important indicators , the Dow industrials ' sister average , the 20 - stock Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second - worst decline next to the 164.78 - point fall during the 1987 crash ."
7713,"Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon ."
7714,"UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday 's 190.58 - point market plunge , fell 56 7/8 to 222 7/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares ."
7715,"Overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said Arthur Cashin Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board ."
7716,`` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory .
7717,It 's just a strange feeling .
7718,I do n't think anyone left the place whistling Dixie . ''
7719,"The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre-trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was `` an abnormal condition , and not a disaster . ''"
7720,"But to traders , it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell ."
7721,The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30 .
7722,"But most of the 30 blue - chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday 's late - afternoon rout ."
7723,"At 9:45 , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3/4 to 117 ."
7724,"The Dow dropped to a quick 27 - point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble ."
7725,"More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood ."
7726,"Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses ."
7727,"There was heavy stock - index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock - index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets ."
7728,"This was a hangover from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks ."
7729,The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized .
7730,They did n't .
7731,"The Dow accelerated its slide , losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading ."
7732,"With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall ."
7733,"Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early - morning fall ."
7734,"And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible ."
7735,All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .
7736,"The program traders were in there , too , of course ."
7737,"But according to one trader , the programmers `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of bargain - hunting '' by institutions ."
7738,"Roland M. Machold , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which oversees $ 29 billion in investments , said the `` first thing we did was to double our orders '' yesterday morning ."
7739,"`` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in '' the market ."
7740,Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes .
7741,"According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day ."
7742,"The stock opened late at 114 1/2 , down 8 1/2 ."
7743,"But then it shot upward 7 1/2 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said ."
7744,"However , Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said : `` I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume . ''"
7745,"Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's gridlock ."
7746,"At Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. , head equity trader Dudley Eppel said : `` I think the opening was constructive ."
7747,It was orderly .
7748,We put some orders together .
7749,"There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... ."
7750,Not like Friday where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart . ''
7751,"Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were glum ."
7752,"But in another dramatic burst , the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes , and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74 ."
7753,"On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders yelped their approval ."
7754,"Grinned Griffith Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . ''"
7755,"Around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off ."
7756,"Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares ."
7757,"`` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist ."
7758,But not everybody was making money .
7759,"The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock - index options was halted Friday ."
7760,"Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses ."
7761,"Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning ."
7762,"`` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one Chicago - based options trader ."
7763,"Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose 20 stocks mimic the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally ."
7764,"James Gallagher , a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago '' -- `` Terrible Tuesday , '' Oct. 20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million and get the program rally started ."
7765,This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away .
7766,"Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a vengeance . ''"
7767,"However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday ."
7768,"`` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said Donald Selkin , head of stock - index futures research at Prudential - Bache Securities Inc ."
7769,"Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's late - afternoon chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them ."
7770,Specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge .
7771,"But yesterday , even with halts in such major blue - chip stocks as Merck , `` we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- and it was n't too bad , '' said Donaldson 's Mr. Eppel , who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday ."
7772,"According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and Valero Energy ."
7773,Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index .
7774,No sector of the market has been spared during the past two days ' gyrations .
7775,"Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. 9 through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real - estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks ."
7776,"And yesterday , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues ."
7777,"For example , Halliburton jumped 3 1/4 to 38 , Schlumberger rose 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1/8 to 22 ."
7778,"Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday ."
7779,"Philip Morris was the Big Board 's most active issue , rising 2 1/4 to 43 1/4 on nearly eight million shares ."
7780,"Among other major issues , Coca - Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares ."
7781,"Shares of International Business Machines , which reported earnings yesterday , finished at 103 , up 1 , after slipping below 100 during Friday 's session for the first time in five years ."
7782,Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings .
7783,"Merrill Lynch added 1 3/4 to 28 , PaineWebber rose 3/4 to 18 1/2 and Bear Stearns rose 3/8 to 14 1/4 ."
7784,"Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6 million shares ."
7785,"At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel ."
7786,Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer - driven strategies in recent months .
7787,"Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were program - related , he said ."
7788,"Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , '' Mr. Phelan said ."
7789,Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday .
7790,"`` Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it 's going to make everybody nervous , including me , '' he said ."
7791,"He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants behaved very , very responsibly today . ''"
7792,"Meanwhile , Peter DaPuzzo , Shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors ."
7793,"`` The institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior , '' Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview ."
7794,`` It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19 .
7795,They used their judgment .
7796,They did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning .
7797,"Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly ."
7798,Maybe they learned from experience . ''
7799,"Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close ."
7800,"`` They did an excellent job , '' Mr. Phelan said of the specialists ."
7801,Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading suspensions .
7802,James A. White and Sonja Steptoe contributed to this article .
7803,West Germany 's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium - powered Galileo probe to Jupiter .
7804,The anti-defense Greens wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today 's scheduled liftoff long enough for them to ask the World Court to `` order '' a permanent cancellation of the $ 1.5 billion flight .
7805,"A three - judge appeals panel yesterday refused to comply , though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way to deny that this was a `` frivolous '' case ."
7806,Of course it was .
7807,"NASA should now sue for fines against all three politico - plaintiffs , foreign and domestic , for bringing this mischievous case ."
7808,A House - Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii .
7809,"The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less ."
7810,"The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face - saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years ."
7811,"By a 6 - 4 margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights ."
7812,But the six - hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions .
7813,"As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast ."
7814,"Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative ."
7815,"The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with more than $ 205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver ."
7816,"From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow ."
7817,"But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina ."
7818,"Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban ."
7819,"Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind - the - scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members ."
7820,"In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor ."
7821,"`` Anybody can vote as they want , '' said Rep. William Lehman -LRB- D. , Fla. -RRB- , head of the House conferees ."
7822,"`` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . ''"
7823,"Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12 % boost ."
7824,"The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental ."
7825,"Leery of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver ."
7826,"Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying ."
7827,The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the gates .
7828,"But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost about $ 2 billion ."
7829,"Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ 30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports ."
7830,"The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program , but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy ."
7831,Congress previously cut six airports this year .
7832,The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 for each passenger in subsidies .
7833,"Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ 615 million for Amtrak , including $ 85 million for capital improvements ."
7834,"And federal - formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at $ 1.625 billion , or $ 20 million more than last fiscal year ."
7835,"Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland , so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package ."
7836,"Last month , the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature , the Sejm , in democratic procedures ."
7837,Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort `` the first gift of democracy . ''
7838,The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse .
7839,"It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page , 13 - pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States ."
7840,"Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles , they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people ."
7841,"Waterford Wedgwood PLC , a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china , reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts -LRB- $ 14.9 million -RRB- from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier ."
7842,"The results for the half were worse than market expectations , which suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish punts ."
7843,"In a sharply weaker London market yesterday , Waterford shares were down 15 pence at 50 pence -LRB- 79 cents -RRB- ."
7844,"The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts , compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year - earlier period ."
7845,There were n't any extraordinary items .
7846,Sales for the total group rose 27 % to 168.1 million Irish punts compared with 132.6 million Irish punts a year ago .
7847,Waterford has decided against paying an interim dividend .
7848,Waterford said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company 's long - term prospects .
7849,The sudden `` flight to quality '' that triggered Friday 's explosive bond - market rally was reversed yesterday in a `` flight from quality '' rout .
7850,"The setback , in which Treasury bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit - taking ."
7851,`` It was a pretty wild day .
7852,"Our markets were closely tied to the stock market , '' said Joel Kazis , manager of trading at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co ."
7853,"`` Friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs , '' he said ."
7854,Some fixed - income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday .
7855,"That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high - quality Treasury bonds , which are safer than other types of securities ."
7856,"But when stocks began to climb instead , prices of Treasury bonds declined ."
7857,Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios .
7858,Among the firms were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
7859,The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1/2 % .
7860,"The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3/4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 % ."
7861,The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy .
7862,Traders said yesterday 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected .
7863,"In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week ."
7864,Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing .
7865,"The Treasury 's benchmark 30 - year bond , ended about 1 3/4 points lower , or down about $ 17.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount ."
7866,The reversal was even more evident among shorter - term Treasury securities .
7867,"After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday , they gave back three - fourths of that amount yesterday ."
7868,"The bond - equivalent yield on three - month Treasury bills , for example , was quoted late yesterday at 7.72 % , compared with 7.16 % Friday ."
7869,"Investment - grade corporate bonds , mortgage - backed securities and municipal bonds also fell ."
7870,"But prices of junk bonds , which were battered Friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session ."
7871,Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed .
7872,Some traders said the high - yield market was helped by active institutional buying .
7873,"In particular , they said , firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels ."
7874,"`` I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high - yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , '' said John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc ."
7875,"U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan , which opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT ."
7876,"The benchmark 30 - year bond , for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600 - point drop in the Tokyo stock market ."
7877,"But as Japanese stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher ."
7878,"Many U.S. trading operations , wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin , were fully staffed during the Tokyo trading session ."
7879,"`` Most of the action was during the night session , '' said Michael Moore , trading manager at Continental Bank ."
7880,"Jay Goldinger , who often trades overnight for Capital Insight Inc. , Beverly Hills , Calif. , said trading in Tokyo was `` very active '' but highly volatile ."
7881,"`` We went down 3/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch , then after lunch we went up 3/4 point in 12 minutes , '' he said ."
7882,"In Tokyo , trading is halted during lunchtime ."
7883,Tokyo 's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for U.S. trading .
7884,"When the market opened here , bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength ."
7885,"The bond market 's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today 's slate of economic data , which includes the government 's report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production ."
7886,"Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2 % , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report ."
7887,The August trade deficit is expected to have widened to $ 9.1 billion from $ 7.58 billion in July .
7888,"A widening of that magnitude , said one New York trader , is `` not a favorable number ... ."
7889,It could do damage to us . ''
7890,"Meanwhile , agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $ 2.3 billion offering of one - year , three - year , five - year and 10 - year maturities ."
7891,"Tomorrow , the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue , which is expected to total between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion and carry a maturity greater than 20 years ."
7892,"Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp. , the new federal agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts ."
7893,"And this week the Tennessee Valley Authority plans to price a $ 3 billion offering , its first public debt borrowing in 15 years ."
7894,"`` There 's lots of supply , '' the New York trader said ."
7895,`` We have a couple or three tough weeks coming . ''
7896,Treasury Securities
7897,Prices of Treasury bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading .
7898,"The benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 101 19/32 , compared with a closing price of 103 12/32 Friday ."
7899,The yield on the benchmark issue rose to 7.97 % from 7.82 % .
7900,"The latest 10 - year notes were quoted late at 100 3/32 for a yield of 7.97 % , compared with 101 9/32 to yield 7.84 % ."
7901,Short - term interest rates fell yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction .
7902,"The average discount rate on new three - month Treasury bills was 7.37 % , the lowest since the average of 7.36 % at the auction on Oct. 17 , 1988 ."
7903,"The average discount rate was 7.42 % on new six - month bills , the lowest since the average of 7.35 % at the auction on July 31 , 1989 ."
7904,Here are auction details :
7905,Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
7906,"Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it ."
7907,"The percentage rates are calculated on a 360 - day year , while the coupon - equivalent yield is based on a 365 - day year ."
7908,Both issues are dated Oct. 19 .
7909,"The 13 - week bills mature Jan. 18 , 1990 , and the 26 - week bills mature April 19 , 1990 ."
7910,Corporate Issues
7911,Investment - grade corporate bonds ended one to 1 1/2 point lower .
7912,There were no new issues .
7913,Foreign Bonds
7914,Foreign bonds surged as the dollar weakened against most major currencies .
7915,"Among benchmark issues : -- Japan 's No. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers screens at 96.15 , up 1.17 point ."
7916,The yield was 5.245 % .
7917,"-- West Germany 's 6 3/4 % issue due June 1999 ended at 98.30 , up 0.91 point to yield 6.99 % ."
7918,"-- Britain 's 11 3/4 % bond due 2003/2007 ended 1 1/8 higher at 111 19/32 to yield 10.12 % , while the 11 3/4 % notes due 1991 rose 21/32 to 98 26/32 to yield 12.74 % ."
7919,Mortgage - Backed Securities
7920,Mortgage securities gave up most of Friday 's gains as active issues ended 24/32 to 30/32 point lower .
7921,"Dealers said morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in Treasury securities , but trading slowed to moderate levels in the afternoon ."
7922,"Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 4/32 , down 30/32 from Friday ; 9 1/2 % securities were down 27/32 at 100 5/32 ; and 10 % securities were at 102 2/32 , off 24/32 ."
7923,"Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 1/4 , down 3/4 ."
7924,"On Friday , mortgage issues gained as much as 1 5/32 ."
7925,"Late yesterday Ginnie Mae 9 % securities were yielding 9.39 % to a 12 - year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10 - year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.42 ."
7926,Traders said there were some busy dealings in Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association securities because underwriters from last week 's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals .
7927,"Offsetting the Remic - related purchases were continued heavy sales by mortgage originators , which are producing increased amounts of fixed - rate mortgage - backed issues with lower rates ."
7928,There was no new - issue activity in the derivative market .
7929,Municipals
7930,Rebounding stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1/4 to 3/4 point lower in late dealings .
7931,The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday prompted a capital markets rally .
7932,"Trading was hectic during the morning , with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday 's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness ."
7933,"Tax - exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion , but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash was n't at hand ."
7934,Professionals dominated municipal trading throughout the session .
7935,Traders said retail investors seemed to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market .
7936,"New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was off 3/4 at 98 1/2 bid , yielding 7.32 % , up 0.07 percentage point from late Friday ."

7942,"A BMA spokesman said `` runaway medical costs '' have made health insurance `` a significant challenge , '' and margins also have been pinched by changes in the mix of life - insurance products consumers now demand ."
7943,"The Business Men 's Assurance unit represented about $ 288 million of the company 's $ 488 million in 1988 revenue , and the unit 's operating income was about $ 10 million , said the spokesman ."
7944,"BMA 's investment banker , Alex . Brown & Sons Inc. , has been authorized to contact possible buyers for the unit ."
7945,Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. said it raised its stake in ADT Ltd. of Bermuda to 29.4 % from 28 % .
7946,"A spokesman for Laidlaw declined to disclose the price the Toronto transportation and waste services concern paid for the additional shares , which he said were acquired `` over the last couple of weeks . ''"
7947,The spokesman said Laidlaw would n't increase its stake in ADT beyond 30 % `` without a great deal of thought '' because of British takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more than 30 % to extend an offer to the rest of the company 's shareholders .
7948,"ADT , a security services and auctions company , trades on London 's Stock Exchange ."
7949,"Laidlaw is 47%-controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd. , a Montreal transportation , resources and industrial holding concern ."
7950,"Nintendo Co. , a Japanese maker of video games , electronic information systems and playing cards , posted a 23 % unconsolidated surge in pretax profit to 61.41 billion yen -LRB- $ 429 million -RRB- from 50 billion yen -LRB- $ 349.9 million -RRB- for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31 ."

7954,"Without detailing specific product breakdowns , Nintendo credited its bullish upsurge in sales -- including advanced computer games and television entertainment systems -- to surging `` leisure - oriented '' sales in foreign markets ."
7955,"Export sales for leisure items alone , for instance , totaled 184.74 billion yen in the 12 months , up from 106.06 billion in the previous fiscal year ."
7956,"Domestic leisure sales , however , were lower ."

7961,"The closely held Hertz Corp. had annual revenue of close to $ 2 billion in 1988 , of which $ 1.7 billion was contributed by its Hertz Rent A Car operations world - wide ."
7962,"Hertz Equipment is a major supplier of rental equipment in the U.S. , France , Spain and the U.K ."

7964,"Gitano Group Inc. said it agreed to buy 50 % of Regatta Sport Ltd. , a closely held apparel maker , with the assumption of $ 3 million of contingent debt ."
7965,"Under the terms of the contract , New York - based Gitano has the option to acquire the remaining 50 % of Regatta , a maker of men 's and women 's clothes sold primarily in department stores , under certain conditions ."
7966,"That 50 % is now held by Clifford Parker , Regatta 's president and chief executive officer , who will continue to manage Regatta 's operations under Gitano ."
7967,"In 1989 , Regatta will have sales `` in excess of $ 10 million '' and will show a profit , Mr. Parker said ."
7968,"Gitano , which makes budget - priced apparel sold mainly through mass merchandisers like K mart and Wal - Mart , said the Regatta acquisition will enhance its strategy to expand into department stores ."
7969,"This fall , Gitano began manufacturing moderately priced clothes aimed at department stores under the Gloria Vanderbilt trademark , which Gitano recently acquired ."
7970,What does n't belong here ?
7971,"A. manual typewriters , B. black - and - white snapshots , C. radio adventure shows ."
7972,"If you guessed black - and - white snapshots , you 're right ."
7973,"After years of fading into the background , two - tone photography is coming back ."
7974,"Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black - and - white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor ."
7975,Portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black - and - white portrait orders .
7976,And black - and - white photography classes are crowded with students .
7977,"What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography ."
7978,"On Seventh Avenue , designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white ."
7979,"And classic black - and - white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes , spurred , in part , by the backlash against colorization of old films ."
7980,"`` The pendulum is swinging back to black and white , '' says Richard DeMoulin , the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional photography division ."
7981,"Until two years ago , sales of black - and - white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s ."
7982,"But last year , buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased 5 % , and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year ."
7983,"Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market , reviving some black - and - white product lines and developing new ones ."
7984,"At Kodak , which largely ignored the market for years , black - and - white film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company 's $ 3 billion in film and paper sales annually , up from 10 % three years ago ."
7985,"The Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant recently began marketing T - Max 3200 , one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films ."
7986,"Aimed at commercial photographers , the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality , says Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter ."
7987,"Also trying to snare a portion of the $ 2 billion - a - year industry is Agfa Corp. , a unit of Bayer AG ."
7988,Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith - Joyner to endorse a new line of black - and - white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak 's papers .
7989,"Slated for market by the end of the year , the paper `` could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then , '' says an Agfa spokesman ."
7990,"The biggest beneficiary of the black - and - white revival is likely to be International Paper Co. 's Ilford division , known in the industry for its premium products ."
7991,"Sales of Ilford 's four varieties of black - and - white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the company wo n't say by exactly how much ."
7992,"`` We hope the trend lasts , '' says Laurie DiCara , Ilford 's marketing communications director ."
7993,Why all the interest ?
7994,"For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye - catching and exotic ."
7995,"`` It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it , '' says Owen B. Butler , the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology ."
7996,"`` You can shift out of reality with black and white , '' he adds ."
7997,"Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising ."
7998,Processing of black - and - white commercial film jumped 24 % last year to 18.7 million rolls .
7999,"Consider Gap Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features black - and - white shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well - known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and T - shirts ."
8000,"Richard Crisman , the account manager for the campaign , says Gap did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors ."
8001,"`` We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , '' he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ''"
8002,The campaign won a Cleo award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer .
8003,"Even food products and automobiles , which have long depended on color , are making the switch ."
8004,"Companies `` feel black and white will convey a stronger statement , '' says Marc L. Hauser , a Chicago photographer who is working on a black - and - white print ad for Stouffer Food Corp. 's Lean Cuisine ."
8005,Other companies that are currently using two - tone ads include American Express Co. and Epson America Inc .
8006,Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend .
8007,"Using black and white , `` we can make housewives look like stars , '' says John Perrin ."
8008,"His On - Broadway Photography studio in Portland , Ore. , doubled its business last year and , he says , is booked solid for the next five ."
8009,"One customer , Dayna Brunsdon , says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic ."
8010,"I show it to my friends , and they all say ` wow . '"
8011,It is n't ordinary like color . ''
8012,"Still , most consumers are n't plunking black - and - white film into their cameras to take family snapshots ."
8013,One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore .
8014,"Typically , it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned ."
8015,"Black - and - white film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same ."
8016,"But for photofinishers , developing costs for black - and - white film are higher ."
8017,Some companies are starting to tackle that problem .
8018,"Ilford , for example , recently introduced a black - and - white film that can be processed quickly by color labs ."
8019,"Intent on wooing customers , the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black - and - white photography classes ."
8020,"Similarly , Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges , offering free black - and - white film and paper as prizes ."
8021,And Kodak is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently .
8022,Other companies are introducing related products .
8023,"Charles Beseler Co. , a leading maker of photographic enlargers , introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen - agers who want to process their own black - and - white photographs ."
8024,"The kit , which has a suggested retail price of $ 250 and has already become a bestseller , was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment ."
8025,"`` It seems computers as hobbies have waned , '' says Ian Brightman , Beseler 's chairman and chief executive officer ."
8026,But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad .
8027,"They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints ."
8028,"`` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , '' says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute ."
8029,`` The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago .
8030,You ca n't say the same with black and white . ''
8031,"But when Popular Photography , a leading magazine for photographers , selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's 150th anniversary , all were black and white ."
8032,"`` It 's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , '' says Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America ."
8033,`` That 's the appeal .
8034,"Agip S.p . A. and Societe National Elf Aquitaine , the state oil companies of Italy and France , respectively , submitted an offer to buy Gatoil Suisse S.A ."
8035,The price was n't disclosed .
8036,"A spokesman for Gatoil said that the Swiss oil concern was examining the offer , submitted last Friday , along with two other offers , also submitted last week ."
8037,Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies .
8038,The spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks .
8039,"Gatoil Suisse owns an oil refinery in Switzerland with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day , along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets ."
8040,"While Friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a little - known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy 's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity ."
8041,"The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business Cycle Research here , reached a record high of 223.0 in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then ."
8042,The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March .
8043,"The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100 ."
8044,"In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year ."
8045,Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end .
8046,"But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says Geoffrey H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility ."
8047,"A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end ."
8048,The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely .
8049,"`` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks , '' Mr. Moore reports ."
8050,"Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well ."
8051,"They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation ."
8052,"Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators ."
8053,"Over the full post-World War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries ."
8054,"The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries ."
8055,"The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression ."
8056,The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash .
8057,"`` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , '' Mr. Moore says ."
8058,"A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond - price index , which is not a part of the Commerce index ."
8059,"In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 ."
8060,"It also rose last Friday , while the stock market sagged ."
8061,"Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new home - building permits ."
8062,"Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long - range prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some short - run twists and turns . ''"
8063,"As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index ."
8064,"It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components ."
8065,"The stock market has lost some precursory power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments ."
8066,"`` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign - trade balance and inflows of foreign capital ."
8067,He also feels that the rise of such computer - based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .
8068,"BSN S.A. , a leading French food group , said it agreed to acquire Birkel G.m.b . H. , a West German pasta maker ."
8069,The value of the acquisition was n't disclosed .
8070,The move is in line with BSN 's strategy of gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth .
8071,"BSN will initially acquire a 15 % interest in Birkel , a closely held concern ."
8072,"The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding , and this could be completed within a few months , a BSN spokeswoman said ."
8073,"The takeover was submitted for approval by the West German cartel office , BSN said ."
8074,"Birkel is West Germany 's second - biggest producer of pasta , with sales of 250 million marks -LRB- $ 133.4 million -RRB- in 1988 ."
8075,"It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany , and is that nation 's leading producer of pasta sauces ."
8076,The acquisition strengthens BSN 's position in the European pasta market .
8077,"The French group currently ranks second after Barilla Group of Italy , whose sales are chiefly in the Italian market ."
8078,"Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it reduced its rating on $ 281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company , to C from Ca , saying it believes bondholders will recover only `` negligible principal . ''"
8079,The agency said it confirmed American Continental 's preferred stock rating at C .
8080,"American Continental 's thrift unit , Los Angeles - based Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , is in receivership and the parent company has filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code ."
8081,CENTRUST SAVINGS BANK -LRB- Miami -RRB- --
8082,Moody 's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its ratings on the subordinated debt of CenTrust to Caa from B - 3 .
8083,The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long - term deposits to B - 3 from Ba - 3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa .
8084,The rating agency said about $ 85 million in securities was affected .
8085,"The downgrades were prompted , Moody 's said , by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust 's preferred stock ."
8086,"Moody 's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could , if completed , endanger the thrift 's funding and market position ."

8142,An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia .
8143,This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election .
8144,The most likely winner will be the Marxist - dominated SWAPO rebels .
8145,"The U.S. journalist 's `` crime '' was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness , Bryan O'Linn , was openly sympathetic to SWAPO ."
8146,"Shortly after that , Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated ."
8147,"Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation , issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year , which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to `` insult , disparate or belittle '' the election commission ."
8148,The Stanley affair does n't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government .
8149,"To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa ."
8150,"SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the `` sole , authentic representative '' of Namibia 's people in"
8151,"Last year , the U.S. brokered a peace settlement to remove Cuba 's `` Afrika Korps '' from Angola and hold `` free and fair '' elections that would end South Africa 's control of Namibia ."
8152,The elections are set for Nov. 7 .
8153,"In July , Mr. Stanley , editor of American Press International , a Washington D.C. - based conservative wire service , visited Namibia to report on the U.N. - monitored election campaign ."
8154,"He interviewed Mr. O'Linn , head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation , and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court ."
8155,"After Mr. Stanley 's article was published in two Namibian newspapers , Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors , publisher and lawyer ."
8156,Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month .
8157,Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley 's detention .
8158,Mr. Stanley 's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail Namibia 's elections .
8159,Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters .
8160,The U.S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results .
8161,It now has the chance to redress that record in Namibia .
8162,State and the human - rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the United Nation 's monitors make certain that Mr. O'Linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides .
8163,Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday .
8164,"Yesterday , the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness ."
8165,"Later , however , it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors ."
8166,"Gold , the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar , rising early in the day as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered ."
8167,Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy .
8168,Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved .
8169,"Crude oil declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net loss ."
8170,Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines .
8171,"In Chicago , grain and soybean prices rose slightly ."
8172,"Livestock and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork ."
8173,"In commodity markets yesterday : PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently , first falling and then later rising ."
8174,Silver performed quietly .
8175,The spot October gold price rose $ 4 to $ 367.30 an ounce .
8176,"The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $ 3.90 an ounce at $ 371.20 , after trading as high as $ 374 ."
8177,December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $ 5.163 .
8178,"Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened ."
8179,Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on Black Monday .
8180,"For one thing , last Friday , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late - in - the - day nose dive , so it could n't react to it ."
8181,"Back on Friday , Oct. 16 , l987 , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell ."
8182,"The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ 8.70 to as high as $ 471.60 , and the more deferred positions , due to mature as late as March 1989 , rose as much as $ 9.60 ."
8183,"On Black Monday , Oct. 19 , 1987 , the October contract tacked on further gains , rising to as high as $ 491.50 for a gain of almost $ 20 on top of the Friday advances , before giving up almost $ 10 of that at the close ."
8184,Yesterday 's October gain of $ 4 was miniscule compared with that .
8185,"One analyst , Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co. , New York , said the gold market already had some good price - supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market ."
8186,"`` What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , '' said Mr. Cardillo ."
8187,"There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said ."
8188,"He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising ."
8189,"Finally , according to Mr. Cardillo , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released today ."
8190,"This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold , he said ."
8191,ENERGY :
8192,"Worried that Friday 's 190 - point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices ."
8193,"The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ 20.59 a barrel for November delivery , down 30 cents ."
8194,"Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow , following several days of significant gains ."
8195,But most market observers agreed that Friday 's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday .
8196,"Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong ."
8197,The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand .
8198,"So any bearish indicator , such as Friday 's precipitous drop in the stock market , sends shivers through the oil markets as well ."
8199,"Indeed , after reacting early in the trading day to Friday 's plummet , futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday ."
8200,COPPER :
8201,Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved .
8202,The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745 .
8203,Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use .
8204,"But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three - month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over , according to an analyst ."
8205,"Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan , which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank ."
8206,"Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company ."
8207,"Now , the analyst said , only minor points remain to be cleaned up ."
8208,"`` For all intents and purposes , an agreement appears to have been achieved , '' he said ."
8209,"Copper inventories in New York 's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons , to 10,004 tons ."
8210,"London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons , to 89,300 tons ."
8211,"The LME stocks decline was about as expected , but the Comex gain was n't ."
8212,"However , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said ."
8213,"At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 , but it was n't able to sustain the gain ."
8214,"`` It was simply overbought , '' he said , and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices ."
8215,COTTON :
8216,"Futures prices eased , more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market ."
8217,"The December contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound , at 74.48 cents ."
8218,"Technical considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market Friday , caused prices to decline yesterday , said Ernest Simon , cotton specialist for Prudential - Bache Securities , New York ."
8219,"Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana , which is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton - growing area ."
8220,"However , after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip late Friday , Mr. Simon said ."
8221,"That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure , he said ."
8222,"Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend , Mr. Simon said ."
8223,"That has n't yet captured traders ' attention , he added ."
8224,SUGAR :
8225,Futures prices declined .
8226,The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents .
8227,"At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered , but the price then fell back ."
8228,"A price - depressing factor , one analyst said , was that India , which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market , did n't make any purchases ."
8229,"India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected to buy more , the analyst said ."
8230,Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market .
8231,"`` India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , '' said Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York ."
8232,"At any rate , she added , `` India needs the sugar , so it will be in sooner or later to buy it . ''"
8233,FARM PRODUCTS :
8234,"The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which would hurt demand for beef and pork ."
8235,The price of the hog contract for October delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound .
8236,The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering .
8237,"Earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows ."
8238,"A broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts , apparently to take advantage of the price dip ."
8239,"Whirlpool Corp. , Benton Harbor , Mich. , said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , that previously entered the atmosphere during in - home repair of refrigerators and freezers ."
8240,"The maker of home appliances said the process , which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center , is already in use at a number of its service centers , and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring ."
8241,Earlier repairs vented the CFCs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere .
8242,"CFCs are widely used as solvents , coolants and fire suppressants ."
8243,"But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth 's ozone layer , and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance ."
8244,"Whirpool said , `` We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture ."
8245,"Maxus Energy Corp. , Dallas , said it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered Intan Field in the southeast Sumatra area of Indonesia ."
8246,"Maxus said it did n't run a production test on the three discovery wells it drilled in the field , which is about 1.6 miles from the Intan Field , because the wells are similar to others drilled at its Intan and Widuri fields ."
8247,"However , Maxus said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil ."
8248,The Intan Field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the Widuri Field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels .
8249,"Maxus , an independent oil and gas concern , is the operator and owns a 56 % interest in the new field , called Northeast Intan ."
8250,"Other interests are owned by BP Petroleum Development -LRB- SES -RRB- Ltd. , C. Itoh Energy Co. Ltd. , Deminex Sumatra OEL G.m.b . H. , Hispanoil -LRB- Sumatra -RRB- Production Ltd. , Hudbay Oil -LRB- Indonesia -RRB- Ltd. , Inpex Sumatra Co. Ltd. , Lasmo Sumatra Ltd. , Sunda Shell , TCR Sumat A.G. and Warrior Oil Co ."
8251,"The production - sharing contract area is held with Pertamina , the Indonesian state oil company ."
8252,"Hughes Aircraft Co. , a unit of General Motors Corp. , said it agreed to purchase the Electro - Optics Technology division of Perkin - Elmer Corp ."
8253,Terms of the agreement were n't disclosed .
8254,"But for the fiscal year ended July 31 , 1988 , the most recent period for which results were broken out , the Perkin - Elmer unit accounted for more than half the $ 145 million in sales recorded by the company 's government systems sector ."
8255,"Perkin - Elmer , which is based in Norwalk , Conn. , said the sale of the Danbury , Conn. , unit is consistent with its restructuring strategy announced in April ."
8256,"In addition to making electro - optical systems , the unit also makes laser warning receivers ."
8257,These are used aboard military helicopters to warn pilots that a laser weapon has been focused on them .
8258,"Hughes of Los Angeles said the PerkinElmer unit 's work complements efforts by its Electro - Optical and Data Systems group , which makes infrared sensors , military lasers and night vision equipment ."
8259,Hughes said it expects the sale to close by year end .
8260,The Communications Workers of America ratified a new regional contract and all but one of the local agreements with Bell Atlantic Corp .
8261,"CWA 's New Jersey Commercial local , which represents about 2,500 service representatives and marketing employees , rejected the tentative agreement ."
8262,Both the union and the regional telephone company said they were working together to resolve differences .
8263,"The new three - year contracts , which replace ones that expired Aug. 5 , cover 41,000 Bell Atlantic employees ."
8264,The ratification follows a 23 - day strike against the Philadelphia - based company .
8265,"Meanwhile , CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members remain on strike against Nynex Corp. , the New York - based regional phone company ."
8266,The unions and the company last week agreed to mediation .
8267,"The CWA represents 40,000 Nynex workers and the IBEW represents 20,000 workers ."
8268,"For the moment , at least , euphoria has replaced anxiety on Wall Street ."
8269,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38 , panic did n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday 's dizzying 190 - point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity ."
8270,Many went bargain - hunting .
8271,"Among those sighing with relief was John H. Gutfreund , chairman of Salomon Brothers , who took to the firm 's trading floor to monitor yesterday 's events ."
8272,"As the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m. , he smiled broadly , brandished his unlit cigar and slapped Stanley Shopkorn , his top stock trader , on the back ."
8273,"At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself ."
8274,"As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers ."
8275,"By 10:10 , the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles had kicked off Friday 's plunge , still had n't opened ."
8276,"But then , as quickly as the Dow had fallen , it began to turn around ."
8277,It ended with a gain of 88.12 points .
8278,"By the market 's close , volume on the New York exchange totaled more than 416 million , the fourth highest on record ."
8279,"The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987 ."
8280,"But the rally was largely confined to the blue - chip stocks , which had been hard hit during Friday 's selling frenzy ."
8281,"Overall , more Big Board stocks lost money than gained ."
8282,"And many arbitragers , already reeling from Friday 's collapse of the UAL deal , were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines , collapsed ."
8283,"Indeed , the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged 102.06 points , its second - worst drop in history ."
8284,"World - wide , trading was generally manageable ."
8285,"The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets , with blue chips there falling 12.8 % ."
8286,"In London , a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2 % , and Tokyo 's leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading ."
8287,"Other , more thinly traded Asian markets were hit harder than Tokyo 's , but there were no free - fall declines ."
8288,"Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in a few hours ' time must be expected ."
8289,"What 's more , such short - term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling ."
8290,"Stephen Boesel , a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore , says , `` There was less panic than in 1987 : We had been through it once . ''"
8291,"In Somerset , Wis. , Adrian Sween , who owns a supplier of nursing - home equipment and is n't active in the stock market , agrees ."
8292,"`` I look at it as a ho - hum matter , '' he says ."
8293,Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback .
8294,The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day .
8295,"Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts ."
8296,"The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen , bounced back strongly to 141.8 , thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks ."
8297,And the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped calm investors .
8298,"Many major institutions , for example , came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday ."
8299,"Still , amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's ."
8300,"`` There is too much complacency , '' says money manager Barry Schrager ."
8301,"Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world - wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe ."
8302,"So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue - chip stocks got off to a rocky start ."
8303,"The average plunged some 600 points , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading ."
8304,"But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down 647 ."
8305,"Unlike two years ago , most of Japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out ."
8306,"In Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process ."
8307,"Clients `` are all staying out '' of the market , one Merrill trader says ."
8308,The relative calm in Tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in Europe .
8309,Frankfurt 's opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders .
8310,"`` The beginning was chaotic , '' says Nigel Longley , a broker for Commerzbank"
8311,"In London , the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm , Jefferies & Co. , also was troubling ."
8312,A computer screen displaying 100 blue - chip stocks colors each one red when its price is falling .
8313,The screen was a sea of red .
8314,"`` I see concern , but I do n't see panic , '' says J. Francis Palamara , a New Yorker who runs the 15 - trader office ."
8315,"London 's blue - chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m . New York time , sending an encouraging message to Wall Street ."
8316,"When trading opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. EDT , stocks fell sharply -- as expected ."
8317,Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points .
8318,"With sell orders piled up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow could n't open on time ."
8319,"By 9:45 , the industrial average had dropped 27 points ."
8320,"By 10 a.m. , it was down 49 ."
8321,"Ten minutes later , the Dow hit bottom - down 63.52 points , another 2.5 % ."
8322,"But shortly before then , some of Wall Street 's sharpest traders say , they sensed a turn ."
8323,"`` The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was Treasury bonds were off , '' says Austin George , head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price ."
8324,`` It meant that people were n't running pell - mell to the safety of bonds . ''
8325,"Shortly after 10 a.m. , the Major Market Index , a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the DJIA , exploded upward ."
8326,Stock traders were buoyed -- because an upturn in the MMI had also started the recovery in stocks on the Tuesday following Black Monday .
8327,"`` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton ."
8328,Shearson 's London trading room went wild .
8329,"Traders shouted out as their Reuters , Quotron and Telerate screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on Wall Street ."
8330,"Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day ."
8331,"`` Rally , rally , rally , '' shouted Shearson 's Andy Rosen ."
8332,`` This is panic buying . ''
8333,"Major blue - chip stocks like Philip Morris , General Motors and Proctor & Gamble led the rally ."
8334,Japanese were said to be heavy buyers .
8335,German and Dutch investors reportedly loaded up on Kellogg Co .
8336,"Then , traders say , corporations with share buy - back programs kicked into high gear , triggering gains in , among other issues , Alcan Aluminium and McDonald 's ."
8337,"Walt Disney Co. , which had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on Friday and was one of seven stocks that halted trading and never reopened that day , opened yesterday late at 114.5 , down 8.5 ."
8338,"But then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer , traders said ."
8339,"By 10:25 , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors ."
8340,"Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares ."
8341,"`` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist ."
8342,"`` What we had was a real , old - fashioned rally . ''"
8343,"This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street 's `` black boxes , '' computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods ."
8344,"Typical , perhaps , was Batterymarch 's Dean LeBaron ."
8345,"Mr. LeBaron , who manages $ 10 billion , says , `` We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was programmed to do . ''"
8346,"Asked what stocks the computer bought , the money manager says , `` I do n't know . ''"
8347,Not everybody was making money .
8348,"The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock - index options was halted Friday ."
8349,"Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses ."
8350,"Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning ."
8351,"`` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one Chicago - based options trader ."
8352,"Meanwhile , a test of the stock market 's rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the Dow at 2600 , up 31 points on the day ."
8353,"Charles Clough , a strategist at Merrill Lynch , says bargain hunting had explained the Dow 's strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow ."
8354,"Moreover , the announcement that real estate magnate and sometime raider Donald Trump was withdrawing his offer for AMR Corp. might have been expected to rattle traders ."
8355,"Instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying ."
8356,The market closed minutes after reaching its high for the day of
8357,"Across the country , many people took yesterday 's events in stride , while remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general ."
8358,"Says James Norman , the mayor of Ava , Mo. : `` I do n't invest in stocks ."
8359,I much prefer money I can put my hands on . ''
8360,"While Mayor Norman found the market 's performance Monday reassuring , he says , he remains uneasy ."
8361,`` We have half the experts saying one thing and half the other '' about the course of the economy .
8362,"Ralph Holzfaster , a farmer and farm - supply store operator in Ogallala , Neb. , says of the last few days events , `` If anything good comes out of this , it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids . ''"
8363,"Says Gordon Fines , a money manager at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis , `` You 're on a roller coaster , and that may last ."
8364,The public is still cautious .

8420,Britain 's Blue Arrow PLC intends to change its name to Manpower PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $ 1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of U.S. - based Manpower Inc .
8421,Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to reincorporating the world 's biggest employment - services group in the U.S. .
8422,"Mr. Fromstein disclosed the planned steps , expected within a few months , as Blue Arrow posted a 2.5 % drop in its third - quarter pretax earnings ."
8423,The name change and good will write - off could help solidify Blue Arrow 's dominance of the U.S. temporary - help market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday 's market plunge .
8424,U.S. holders now own more than 60 % of Blue Arrow compared with 9 % last January .
8425,"`` In the U.S. market , the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow , '' Mr. Fromstein said ."
8426,The moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil .
8427,"`` It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past , '' said Doug Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York ."
8428,"The proposed changes `` all make a lot of sense to me , '' he added ."
8429,"In a widely publicized boardroom coup , Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January , a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $ 1 million - a - year chief of Milwaukee - based Manpower ."
8430,Mr. Fromstein solidified his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman .
8431,"But the Blue Arrow tumult is n't over yet , as the British government is investigating a disputed # 25 million -LRB- $ 39.4 million -RRB- loan which Mr. Fromstein has said was made under Mr. Berry 's direction ."
8432,Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $ 1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies .
8433,"Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase ."
8434,"As a U.S. - based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings ."
8435,"Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets ."
8436,"But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards ."
8437,"`` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' Mr. Fromstein said ."
8438,"The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the 1987 write - off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written off . ''"
8439,"Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop , but would n't specify how much ."
8440,"People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write - down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower 's good will ."
8441,"That move , along with the return to the Manpower name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help ."
8442,"The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after sliding nearly 3.5 % in July , said Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur ."
8443,Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain .
8444,"Overall , pretax profit slid to # 18.49 million in the quarter from # 18.98 million a year earlier ."
8445,"The economy 's temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation ."
8446,The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow .
8447,"The trade gap is expected to widen to about $ 9 billion from July 's $ 7.6 billion , according to a survey by MMS International , a unit of McGraw - Hill Inc. , New York ."
8448,"Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported Friday in the producer price index ."
8449,"That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got started on its reckless 190 - point plunge ."
8450,"Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow ."
8451,"Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought to have inched upward ."
8452,"`` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said Michael Englund , director of research at MMS ."
8453,"A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted ."
8454,"In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made ."
8455,"`` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said ."
8456,"Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said ."
8457,Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations .
8458,"The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to MMS ."
8459,"A rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report ."
8460,The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August .
8461,"Robert H. Chandross , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level ."
8462,"`` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said ."
8463,"Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet / Norstar Financial Group ."
8464,"He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month ."
8465,He expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases .
8466,"Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units ."
8467,"Economists say an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards ."

8475,"`` Capital City '' is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer , Thames Television ."
8476,The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987 .
8477,"Let 's make that 1929 , just to be sure ."
8478,"According to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` Capital City , '' set at Shane Longman , a fictional mid-sized securities firm with # 500 million capital , `` follows the fortunes of a close - knit team of young , high - flying dealers , hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy ."
8479,But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ... ''
8480,You need n't be a high - powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure .
8481,"The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives ."
8482,"Turned loose in Shane Longman 's trading room , the yuppie dealers do little right ."
8483,"Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , Shane Longman 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week ."
8484,"In the opening episode we learn that Michelle , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch ."
8485,"Trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly ."
8486,"Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world , Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone ."
8487,Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today .
8488,"Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds , in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look lousy ."
8489,"Ah , perfidious Columbia !"
8490,"The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price ."
8491,So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second .
8492,And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds -LRB- since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays ? -RRB- .
8493,"Surprisingly , Shane Longman survives the week , only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation ."
8494,"Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation , the executive 's internal rivals , led by a loutish American , demand his resignation ."
8495,"The plot is thwarted when the firm 's major stockholder , kelp farming on the other side of the globe , hurries home to support the executive ."
8496,But the investigation continues .
8497,"If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six - figure salaries , you still are left puzzled , because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously ."
8498,"In fact , few consume much of anything ."
8499,Two share a house almost devoid of furniture .
8500,"Michelle lives in a hotel room , and although she drives a canary - colored Porsche , she has n't time to clean or repair it ; the beat - up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock ."
8501,"And it takes Declan , the obligatory ladies ' man of the cast , until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey ."
8502,Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class - conscious Britain is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian free - enterprise regime .
8503,"After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money ."
8504,"This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max , the trading room 's most flamboyant character ."
8505,"Yuppily enough , he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church , wears designer clothes and drives an antique car ."
8506,"But apparently to make him palatable , even lovable , to the masses , the script inflates pony - tailed Max into an eccentric genius , master of 11 Chinese dialects ."
8507,"He takes his wash to the laundromat , where he meets a punky French girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe ."
8508,"In producing and promoting `` Capital City , '' Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day ."
8509,"The production costs are a not inconsiderable # 8 million -LRB- $ 12.4 million -RRB- , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of `` Dealers , '' an earlier made - for - TV movie ."
8510,Another half million quid went for a volley of full - page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway .
8511,"These expenses create a special incentive for `` Capital City 's '' producers to flog it , or a Yank - oriented version of it , in America ."
8512,"Thames 's U.S. marketing agent , Donald Taffner , is preparing to do just that ."
8513,"He is discreetly hopeful , citing three U.S. comedy series -- `` Three 's Company , '' `` Too Close for Comfort '' and `` Check It Out '' -- that had British antecedents ."
8514,"Perhaps without realizing it , Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution : `` Capital City '' should have been a comedy , a worthy sequel to the screwball British `` Carry On '' movies of the 1960s ."
8515,The seeds already are in the script .
8516,"The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading - room crew minded a baby , the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm ."
8517,And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American TV and movie personalities known for light roles .
8518,"Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor ; William Armstrong , who plays Max , could pass for Hans Conreid , and Douglas Hodge -LRB- Declan -RRB- for James Farentino ; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall , the blank - faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies ."
8519,"So , OK kids , everybody on stage for `` Carry On Trading '' : The cast is frantically searching the office for misplaced Japanese bonds that suddenly have soared in value because Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank has just bought the White House ."
8520,"The pressure is too much for Zsa Zsa , who slaps a security guard ."
8521,"He backflips into a desktop computer terminal , which explodes , covering Huntz Hall 's face with microchips ."
8522,"And all the while , the bonds are in the baby 's diaper ."

8524,Mr. Rustin is senior correspondent in the Journal 's London bureau .
8525,"Axa - Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates ."
8526,"The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles - based Farmers ."
8527,"In an attempt to appease U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T ."
8528,"As part of the agreement , Axa agreed to invest $ 1 billion in Hoylake Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle ."
8529,"Of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to Hoylake by Axa , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of Axa 's parent , Axa - Midi Group , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by Axa , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long - term bank loans ."
8530,"In an interview Thursday , Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing ."
8531,"The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said ."
8532,Mr. Bebear said Axa - Midi Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition .
8533,"He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers ."
8534,"`` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said ."
8535,"The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T ."
8536,"`` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said ."
8537,Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated .
8538,"The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition ."
8539,"Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion -LRB- $ 20.71 billion -RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval ."
8540,"A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed ."
8541,"The new financing structure is still a very - highly leveraged one , and Axa still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . ''"
8542,"That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added ."
8543,`` It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders . ''
8544,"To fend off Sir James 's advances , B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern ."
8545,"Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year - ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year ."
8546,"The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American - made cars in the first 10 days of October , a 12.6 % drop from a year earlier ."
8547,"Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4 % to 86,555 pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles ."
8548,"The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which began officially Oct. 1 ."
8549,"This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level ."
8550,"Overall , sales of all domestic - made vehicles fell 11.9 % from a year ago ."
8551,"Without GM , overall sales for the other U.S. automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results ."
8552,"Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up ."
8553,"`` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' said Tom Kelly , sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn , Mich ."
8554,"Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since October 1987 ."
8555,The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month .
8556,"Furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline ."
8557,GM 's domestic car sales dropped 24.3 % and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7 % from the same period a year ago .
8558,All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines .
8559,"Cadillac posted a 3.2 % increase despite new competition from Lexus , the fledging luxury - car division of Toyota Motor Corp ."
8560,Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month - end .
8561,"The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer rebates and low - interest financing , a company spokesman said ."
8562,"Last year , GM had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold ."
8563,"Aside from GM , other car makers posted generally mixed results ."
8564,Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales .
8565,"Chrysler Corp. had a 7.5 % drop in car sales , echoing its generally slow performance all year ."
8566,"However , sales of trucks , including the company 's popular minivans , rose 4.3 % ."
8567,Honda Motor Co. 's sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21.7 % from a year earlier .
8568,"Honda 's plant in Marysville , Ohio , was gearing up to build 1990 model Accords , a Honda spokesman said ."
8569,"`` We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added ."
8570,"Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990 - model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models ."
8571,Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall .
8572,"At that time , Chrysler said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % on most vehicle ."
8573,a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported in period .
8574,c - Domestic car
8575,d - Percentage change is greater than 999 % .
8576,x - There were 8 selling days in the most recent period and 8 a year earlier .

8585,Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` Szabad Europa Radio '' -- Radio Free Europe .
8586,"`` I think this is a victory for the radio , '' says Barnabas de Bueky , a 55 - year - old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich , West Germany , headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service ."
8587,"In fact , the network hopes to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that will have it ."
8588,But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one .
8589,"In fact , Radio Free Europe is in danger of suffering from its success ."
8590,"While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest , so can others ."
8591,"In addition , competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled ."
8592,"Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism , Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring ."
8593,"`` They have a lot to do these days to compete with Hungarian radio , '' says Andrew Deak , a computer - science student at the Technical University in Budapest ."
8594,`` The Hungarian -LCB- radio -RCB- reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here . ''

8601,But Radio Free Europe does n't plan to fade away .
8602,"With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in Hungary and in the `` Great Eastern Beyond . ''"
8603,"Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union , Radio Liberty , say they wo n't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts ."
8604,They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues : from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz .
8605,The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe .
8606,"Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable ."
8607,It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to set up office .
8608,"Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location ."
8609,`` That is a miracle . ''
8610,"It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents -LRB- who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters -RRB- ."
8611,"In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian listeners say they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` Dark Ages of the 20th Century . ''"
8612,"`` During the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios , '' says the writer ."
8613,`` There were some very brave broadcasts . ''
8614,"The listeners , too , had to be brave ."
8615,"Through much of the post-World War II period , listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary ."
8616,"`` When we listen to the Europe station , my mother still gets nervous , '' says a Budapest translator ."
8617,`` She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . ''
8618,"Now , the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the late - night slot ."
8619,Hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight .
8620,"Television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , `` The End of the Day , '' which comes on after 11 p.m ."
8621,It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs .
8622,"Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on Sunday morning for `` Sunday Journal , '' on Hungarian Radio ."
8623,"The competitive spirit is clearly influencing Radio Free Europe , which is trying to beef up programs ."
8624,The Budapest office plans to hire free - lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east .
8625,"The Hungarian service has a daily 40 - minute news show called Newsreel , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world ."
8626,"There 's also a host of new programs , trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics ."
8627,A daily 35 - minute program called `` The March of Time '' tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world .
8628,There 's a program for women and a science show .
8629,"And to attract younger listeners , Radio Free Europe intersperses the latest in Western rock groups ."
8630,The Pet Shop Boys are big this year in Budapest .
8631,"`` We are starving for all the news , '' says Mr. Deak , the student ."
8632,`` Every moment we want to know everything about the world .
8633,"Proposals for government - operated `` national service , '' like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew ."
8634,"The disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service ."
8635,"Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with smallpox ."
8636,"It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall ."
8637,Why does the national - service virus keep coming back ?
8638,Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel .
8639,If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self - discipline again and revive the spirit of giving .
8640,"A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft ."
8641,"Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long - term aim of many national - service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion ."
8642,Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft .
8643,"But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose ."
8644,"This time it attempted to invade two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans ."
8645,"Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ?"
8646,"Military service , moreover , could be a national - service option ."
8647,"Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay - as - you - go moderates , and idealistic liberals ."
8648,"The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents ."
8649,A provision allowing grants to be applied to first - home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .
8650,"The DLC plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care ."
8651,"With a tax - free $ 10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 a year ."
8652,"Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18 - year - olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home ."
8653,They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families .
8654,"As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national - service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . ''"
8655,"Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military - service option being dropped ."
8656,"Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up ."
8657,"What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ?"
8658,"In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn -RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la Sen. Chris Dodd -RRB- , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -LRB- a Kennedy specialty -RRB- , a community service work - study program for students -LRB- pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers , among others -RRB- , plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer , Foster Grandparent , and Senior Companion programs ."
8659,"Before the menu is printed , the House may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million ."
8660,"It is widely known that `` too many cooks spoil the broth , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if they are senators ."
8661,"The `` omnibus '' bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard ."
8662,The aroma of patronage is in the air .
8663,Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ?
8664,"On the contrary , it is as robust as ever ."
8665,"According to the Gallup Poll , American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- ."
8666,"Even if government does see various `` unmet needs , '' national service is not the way to meet them ."
8667,"If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called `` scholarship , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service . ''"
8668,Or we might provide a tax credit for working students .
8669,"What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a GI Bill ."
8670,"To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor - saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short - term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs ."
8671,"Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?"
8672,Not necessarily .
8673,"Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing ."
8674,"Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` volunteers . ''"
8675,"So far , the president seems ill - disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free - standing proposal to endow a `` Points of Light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism ."
8676,"However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects ."
8677,There 's no need for such concessions .
8678,"The omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected ."
8679,"National service , the utopian idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but the millions of knee - socked youth performing works of `` civic content '' will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors ."
8680,Mr. Chapman is a fellow at the Indianapolis - based Hudson Institute .
8681,"This article is adapted from remarks at a Hoover Institution conference on national service , in which Mr. Szanton also participated ."
8682,"Drug Emporium Inc. said Gary Wilber , 39 years old , who had been president and chief operating officer for the past year , was named chief executive officer of this drugstore chain ."
8683,"He succeeds his father , Philip T. Wilber , who founded the company and remains chairman ."
8684,"Robert E. Lyons III , 39 , who headed the company 's Philadelphia region , was appointed president and chief operating officer , succeeding Gary Wilber ."
8685,American Physicians Service Group Inc. said it purchased about 42 % of Prime Medical Services Inc. for about $ 5 million from Texas American Energy Corp .
8686,American Physicians said it also replaced four Texas American representatives on Prime 's five - member board .
8687,American provides a variety of financial services to doctors and hospitals .
8688,"Prime , based in Bedminster , N.J. , provides management services to cardiac rehabilitation clinics and diagnostic imaging centers ."
8689,"For the year ended June 30 , Prime had a net loss of $ 3 million on sales of $ 13.8 million ."
8690,"The inflation - adjusted growth rate for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said ."
8691,The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first - quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % .
8692,"If the economy continues to expand by 0.8 % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said ."
8693,That would be down from the 3.8 % rise posted in 1988 .
8694,"The Canadian government announced a new , 12 - year Canada Savings Bond issue that will yield investors 10.5 % in the first year ."
8695,"The annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set each fall , when details of a new series are released ."
8696,Canada Savings Bonds are major government instruments for meeting its financial requirements .
8697,The government has about 41.4 billion Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 35.2 billion -RRB- of such bonds currently outstanding .
8698,"Only Canadian residents are permitted to buy Canada Savings Bonds , which may be redeemed any time at face value ."
8699,The bonds go on sale Oct. 19 .
8700,The debate over National Service has begun again .
8701,"After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high - school graduation , the focus has shifted to Washington ."
8702,At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring .
8703,"One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , Ga . -RRB- and Rep. Dave McCurdy -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served ."
8704,"An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , and including some diluted Nunn - McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic Sens. Claiborne Pell , Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd , has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee ."
8705,It might well win Senate passage .
8706,"President Bush has outlined his own Youth Entering Service -LRB- YES -RRB- plan , though its details remain to be specified ."
8707,What is one to think of all this ?
8708,Doctrine and special interests govern some responses .
8709,People eager to have youth `` pay their dues to society '' favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones .
8710,"So do those who seek a `` re-energized concept of citizenship , '' a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights ."
8711,Then there are instinctive opponents .
8712,"To libertarians , mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money ."
8713,Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform :
8714,"If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost ."
8715,"Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the regimentation of youth , or want to see rights enlarged , not obligations ."
8716,But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ?
8717,How should we think about national service ?
8718,Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning .
8719,Would service be voluntary or compulsory ?
8720,Short or long ?
8721,Part - time or full - time ?
8722,Paid or unpaid ?
8723,Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ?
8724,What kinds of work would they do ?
8725,What does `` national '' mean ?
8726,"Would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ?"
8727,And who would serve ?
8728,"Only males , as with the draft , or both sexes ?"
8729,Youth only or all ages ?
8730,"Middle - class people , or poor people , or a genuine cross-section ?"
8731,Many or few ?
8732,"Those are not trivial questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them ."
8733,Then how should we think about national service ?
8734,"As a starting point , here are five propositions : 1 . Consider the ingredients , not the name ."
8735,Ignore `` national service '' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals .
8736,They will differ in crucial ways .
8737,2 . `` Service '' should be service .
8738,"As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice ."
8739,"It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career ."
8740,"It follows that proposals like Nunn - McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify ."
8741,"There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given ."
8742,But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high - school graduates with full - time jobs .
8743,Why call that service ?
8744,3 . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not .
8745,Compelled service is unconstitutional .
8746,It is also unwise and unenforceable .
8747,-LRB- Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year ? -RRB-
8748,But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior .
8749,It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages .
8750,"Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing ."
8751,4 . Good programs are not cheap .
8752,"Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought , housing rehabilitated , students tutored , day - care centers staffed ."
8753,"There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply ."
8754,"Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality ."
8755,They involve stipends to participants .
8756,Full - time residential programs also require housing and full - time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale .
8757,"Non-residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year ."
8758,Are they worth that ?
8759,Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted .
8760,But the calculations are challengeable .
8761,5 . Underclass youth are a special concern .
8762,"Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ?"
8763,"Yes , if targeted ."
8764,"People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle - class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost ."
8765,"They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers ."
8766,Underclass youth do n't have those opportunities .
8767,They are not enrolled in high school or college .
8768,They are unlikely to be employed .
8769,"And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self - destructive behaviors and bleak prospects ."
8770,But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service .
8771,Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons .
8772,But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed .
8773,"Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them ."
8774,"Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune - grass with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation ."
8775,"Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service ."
8776,"They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk ."
8777,"But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future ."
8778,That is a service to the nation .
8779,It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve .
8780,"Mr. Szanton , a Carter administration budget official , heads his own Washington - based strategic planning firm ."
8781,He is a co-author of `` National Service : What Would It Mean ? ''
8782,"-LRB- Lexington Books , 1986 -RRB- ."
8783,Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet .
8784,"Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis ."
8785,"And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge ."
8786,But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters .
8787,"In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout ."
8788,"`` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity ."
8789,"The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning ."
8790,"Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment ."
8791,"Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan ."
8792,"It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat ."
8793,The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions .
8794,The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
8795,`` Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact .
8796,"I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's sensible , '' he said ."
8797,"When it was suggested his comment was a `` non-answer , '' Mr. Darman replied : `` It is a non-answer ."
8798,"But , in this context , that 's the smart thing to do . ''"
8799,"At the Treasury , Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market 's drop ."
8800,"`` Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said ."
8801,"`` The economy remains well - balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ''"
8802,But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week .
8803,"`` One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named ."
8804,"`` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago ."
8805,I think that 's less likely . ''
8806,"Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world ."
8807,The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe .
8808,Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments .
8809,"In Tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early Monday morning trading ."
8810,"After the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower ."
8811,"In the Bush administration , the lead is being taken by Treasury Secretary Brady , Undersecretary Robert Glauber and Assistant Secretary Mullins ."
8812,"The three men worked together on the so - called Brady Commission , headed by Mr. Brady , which was established after the 1987 crash to examine the market 's collapse ."
8813,"As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises ."
8814,Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began .
8815,"He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges ."
8816,"Later , Mr. Brady phoned Mr. Greenspan , SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas ."
8817,Aides say he continued to work the phones through the weekend .
8818,"Administration officials say President Bush was briefed throughout Friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for Camp David ."
8819,"He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers ."
8820,Government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business - as - usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic .
8821,"Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs , Va. , when the stock market fell , and remained there through the following day ."
8822,"And as of last night , Fed Chairman Greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning ."
8823,"Ironically , Mr. Greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in Dallas on Oct. 20 , 1987 ."
8824,"He flew to Dallas on Oct. 19 , when the market plummeted 508 points , but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without delivering his speech ."
8825,"Following is a weekly listing of unadited net asset values of publicly traded investment fund shares , reported by the companies as of Friday 's close ."
8826,"Also shown is the closing listed market price or a dealer - to - dealer asked price of each fund 's shares , with the percentage of difference ."
8827,b - As of Thursday 's close .
8828,c - Translated at Commercial Rand exchange rate .
8829,e - In Canadian dollars .
8830,f - As of Wednesday 's close .
8831,g - 10.06.89 NAV:22.15 .
8832,z - Not available .
8833,The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
8834,"Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock - index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average ."
8835,"The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc ."
8836,That early - morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the 1987 crash .
8837,The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume .
8838,"Several of those post-crash changes kicked in during Friday 's one - hour collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge ."
8839,But the major `` circuit breakers '' have yet to be evaluated .
8840,A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test .
8841,"A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash ."
8842,"Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary ."
8843,"The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets ."
8844,"But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended ."
8845,"Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot - line '' communications among exchanges ."
8846,Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half - hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .
8847,"During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's `` Sidecar '' computer program automatically was triggered ."
8848,That system is designed to separate computer - generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks .
8849,One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well - drilled school .
8850,"`` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said Howard Dubnow , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor ."
8851,`` There was no panic .
8852,The system worked the way we devised it to work . ''
8853,"After reopening for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its 30 - point limit and the second freeze went into effect ."
8854,"Traders then spent the last half - hour `` watching to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , '' Mr. Dubnow added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour ."
8855,One observer estimated that 80 % to 90 % of the S&P traders `` were just standing around watching . ''
8856,"But the 250 - point circuit breaker never had to kick in , and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered ."
8857,The MMI and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies .
8858,The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash .
8859,The process of post-crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments .
8860,"In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated ."
8861,Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions .
8862,"In addition , limits were placed on computer - driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets ."
8863,Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated .
8864,"At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill ."
8865,"There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock - index futures and options , which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin , for example , likened to `` barnacles attached to the basic market . ''"
8866,"And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers ."
8867,"When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda ."
8868,"Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full - scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers ."
8869,Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented .
8870,The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .
8871,"In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers ."
8872,"After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ."
8873,"Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists ."
8874,"After all , this free - market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century ."
8875,`` Circuit breakers '' set to soften big drops :
8876,"-- If S&P futures fall 5 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes ."
8877,"-- If Dow Industrials fall 25 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes ."
8878,"-- If S&P futures fall 12 points -LRB- equivalent to about 100 points on DJIA -RRB- , trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher ."
8879,On NYSE program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders .
8880,"-- If S&P futures fall 30 points , trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher ."
8881,"-- If Dow Industrials fall 250 points , trading on the Big Board halts for an hour ."
8882,S&P and MMI contracts also halt .
8883,"-- If DJIA drops 400 points , Big Board halts trading for two hours ."
8884,Trading in MMI and S&P futures also halted .
8885,Brady Task Force recommendations -LRB- Jan. 1988 -RRB- :
8886,-- Establish an overarching regulator for financial markets
8887,-- Unify trade - clearing systems
8888,-- Make margins consistent across stock and futures markets
8889,SEC proposals -LRB- May 1988 -RRB- :

8895,Congressional proposal :
8896,-- Create a task force to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws .
8897,"Breaking the Soviet government 's television monopoly , an independent company has gained rights to show world programming , including American films ."
8898,"`` There must not be a monopoly , there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers , '' Nikolai I. Lutsenko , the president of the Nika TV company , told the weekly newspaper Nedelya ."
8899,"The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year , the newspaper said ."
8900,"Mr. Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the U.S. to pick up the rights to show 5,000 U.S. films in the Soviet Union ."
8901,Nedelya 's article was accompanied by a picture of Mr. Lutsenko interviewing singer John Denver in Colorado .
8902,"Even though it will be independent of official television , Nika will have an oversight board that will include members of the Communist youth league ."
8903,"South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers said that about 10,000 diamond miners struck for higher wages at De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd."
8904,"De Beers said that workers at five of the group 's mines were on strike , which it said was peaceful , with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines ."
8905,The deadlock in negotiations occurred with De Beers offering a 17 % increase in the minimum - wage category while the union demanded a 37.6 % increase in the minimum wage .
8906,Japan 's opposition Socialist Party denied that its legislators had been bribed by pinball - parlor owners .
8907,"The allegation had been raised in Parliament by the governing Liberal Democratic Party following magazine reports suggesting that money from Japanese - style pinball , called pachinko , had infiltrated politics ."
8908,"Tsuruo Yamaguchi , secretary general of the Socialist Party , acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen -LRB- about $ 55,000 -RRB- but said the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry ."
8909,"The World Wide Fund for Nature said that Spain , Argentina , Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders ."
8910,A report by the conservation group presented at the U.N. - sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids .
8911,Fund official Simon Lyster said world trade in wildlife was estimated to total $ 5 billion of business annually .
8912,A NATO project to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull - out of three of its eight participating nations .
8913,"Britain , France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East - West disarmament talks show signs of success ."
8914,Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls .
8915,"A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month , the Tories raised the nation 's base interest rate ."
8916,Labor 's Visa card is believed to be the first linked to a British political party .
8917,Labor gets 25 pence -LRB- 39 cents -RRB- for every 100 -LRB- about $ 155 -RRB- that a user charges to the card .
8918,"As with other plastic in Britain 's high - interest - rate environment , the Labor card , administered by Co-operative Bank , carries a stiff -LRB- in this case , 29.8 % -RRB- annual rate on the unpaid balance ."
8919,China 's year - long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets .
8920,The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down .
8921,The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan -LRB- $ 270 million -RRB- was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies .
8922,The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . ''
8923,"The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth , which soared to 20.7 % last year , to 8 % in 1990 ."
8924,Economists now predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 % for the year .
8925,"In a sign of growing official tolerance for religion , Russian Orthodox priests were allowed to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Moscow patriarchate in the Kremlin 's 15th - century Uspensky Cathedral , where czars were crowned ... ."
8926,"A 34 - foot - tall , $ 7.7 million statue of Buddha was completed on a hill outside Hong Kong , facing China ."
8927,"The statue is the brainchild of Sik Chi Wan , director of the Po Lin Monastery , who said : `` Hong Kong is such a prosperous place , we also need some kind of religious symbol ."
8928,"It all seemed innocent enough : Last April , one Steven B. Iken visited Justin Products Inc. here , identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new cassette players for children ."
8929,"`` It is almost identical to the Sony product , '' Mr. Iken remarked , after seeing prototypes and pictures ."
8930,Replied a Justin salesman : `` Exactly . ''
8931,The Justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40 % below those of Sony Corp. of Japan 's `` My First Sony '' line .
8932,The visitor waxed enthusiastic and promised to return .
8933,But instead of a new customer -- part of a hoped - for bonanza from underselling Sony -- Justin got a costly legal morass .
8934,"Mr. Iken , it turned out , was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for Sony ."
8935,His recording later turned up as a court exhibit .
8936,"Seeking to keep Justin 's `` My Own '' product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law ."
8937,"Since then , life has changed a lot for 61 - year - old Leonard Kaye , Justin 's owner ."
8938,"`` I have n't been able to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on , '' he says ."
8939,`` It 's the most distracting thing in my life -- I ca n't even attend to my business . ''
8940,His company -LRB- annual sales : about $ 25 million -RRB- may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated 10 % of total sales -- if Sony -LRB- annual sales : about $ 16 billion -RRB- prevails .
8941,Justin 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational .
8942,"With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business ."
8943,Americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look - alike products from Japan .
8944,"Now Sony , whose innovative , premium - priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap look - alike produced in China ."
8945,"`` The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it , '' says Lewis H. Eslinger , Sony 's attorney , who previously guarded Rubik 's Cube ."
8946,-LRB- Sony itself declines to comment . -RRB-
8947,"If Sony wins , Mr. Eslinger says , its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas ."
8948,"At worst , he adds , `` They 'd have to grind them all up and throw them away . ''"
8949,Mr. Kaye denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on Sony in the marketplace .
8950,"`` I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper , '' he says ."
8951,"Today , U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected to rule on Sony 's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products , on which deliveries began in July ."
8952,The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments .
8953,"Though hoping to settle the case , Justin vows to fight on , if necessary ."
8954,But the battle is more than Justin bargained for .
8955,"`` I had no idea I was getting in so deep , '' says Mr. Kaye , who founded Justin in 1982 ."
8956,"Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to find he was bored ."
8957,"With Justin , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong , beginning with Mickey Mouse radios ."
8958,"The company has grown -- to about 40 employees , from four initially , Mr. Kaye says ."
8959,"Justin has been profitable since 1986 , adds the official , who shares his office with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys ."
8960,"Like many others , Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children ."
8961,The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models .
8962,"-LRB- In court papers , Sony says it has spent more than $ 3 million to promote the line , with resulting sales of over a million units . -RRB-"
8963,"Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower - priced competitor ."
8964,"His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color ."
8965,"Sony uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin , on the theory that kids prefer these colors ."
8966,"-LRB- `` To be successful , a product can be any color whatsoever , as long as it is fire - engine red , '' says Charles E. Baxley , Justin 's attorney . -RRB-"
8967,"By last winter , Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed ."
8968,"Indeed , concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable Sony products -- against Justin 's customers , Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April ."
8969,He himself threatened to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department .
8970,"But Justin has n't pursued those charges -LRB- which were without merit , according to Mr. Eslinger , the Sony attorney -RRB- ."
8971,Recalls Mr. Baxley : `` Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone .
8972,We never intended taking on Sony -- we do n't have the resources . ''
8973,Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit .
8974,"Off and on since then , the companies have skirmished in court ."
8975,"And Justin , in a news release , says , `` Once competitive , Sony now resorts to strong - arm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets . ''"
8976,Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters .
8977,"He also insists that Sony , no less than others , has a legal right to protect its `` trade dress , '' in this case , mostly the colors that it claims make My First Sony products distinctive ."
8978,-LRB- Justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children 's market . -RRB-
8979,"Whatever its merits , Sony 's aggressive defense is debilitating for Justin ."
8980,It 's also costly .
8981,"Mr. Kaye says he has paid more than $ 70,000 in legal fees so far ."
8982,"Of Sony , Mr. Kaye says : `` They know there 's no way for them to lose ."
8983,They just keep digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away . ''
8984,"For now , though , he vows to hang in ."
8985,"Investcorp , New York , said it and the management of Sports & Recreation Inc. bought the operator of the 10 - store Sports Unlimited chain for some $ 40 million ."
8986,"The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in Sports & Recreation , a 10 - year - old sporting goods retailer , said Oliver E. Richardson , a member of Investcorp 's management committee and a director of the chain ."
8987,"Sports Unlimited , Tampa , Fla. , posted revenue of $ 59 million for the year ended July 31 ."
8988,"The company is `` very profitable '' on an operating basis , Mr. Richardson said , but he declined to specify numbers ."
8989,"In 1982 , Sports & Recreation 's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corp. of Skokie , Ill ."
8990,"In the latest transaction , management bought out the passive investors ' holding , Mr. Richardson said ."
8991,"Hammond Co. , Newport Beach , Calif. , said Fidelity National Financial Inc. extended its previous agreement , under which it wo n't purchase any more of the mortgage banker 's common stock , through Oct. 31 ."
8992,The previous agreement expired Thursday .
8993,"Hammond said that its discussions with Fidelity , an Irvine , Calif. , title - insurance underwriter , are continuing , but that prospects for a longer - term standstill agreement are uncertain ."
8994,Fidelity has increased its stake in Hammond to 23.57 % in recent months .
8995,Statements made in Securities and Exchange Commission filings led Hammond to request a standstill agreement .
8996,"Giant Group Ltd. said it terminated negotiations for the purchase of Aspen Airways , a Denver - based regional carrier that operates the United Express connector service under contract to UAL Corp. 's United Airlines ."
8997,"Giant , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , collection of companies that is controlled by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman , did n't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline , and Aspen officials could n't be reached for comment ."
8998,Giant agreed last month to purchase the carrier .
8999,"Giant has n't ever disclosed the proposed price , although Avmark Inc. , an Arlington , Va. - based aircraft consulting concern , has valued Aspen 's fleet at about $ 46 million ."
9000,"The airline would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of Giant companies , which are involved in making cement , recycling newsprint and operating fast - food restaurants ."
9001,The state - controlled insurer Assurances Generales de France said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company Cie. de Navigation Mixte above 10 % from the current level of about 8 % .
9002,Friday 's approval was needed to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given Wednesday to Cie . Financiere de Paribas .
9003,"Both Paribas and AGF have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed `` investment purposes , '' although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks ."
9004,"AGF did n't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval , but people close to the group said it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future , should interesting price opportunities arise ."
9005,"An AGF official did specify , however , that there was no foundation to recent rumors the group might be acting in concert with Paribas ."
9006,"Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. , a unit of Lockheed Corp. , said it agreed to join with Aermacchi S.p . A. of Varese , Italy , to propose a new generation of jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force ."
9007,"The Air Force is looking to buy 540 new primary jet trainers , with a total value of $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion , between 1994 and 2004 ."
9008,"The aircraft would replace the T - 37 , made by the Cessna Aircraft Co. unit of General Dynamics Corp. , which the Air Force uses to train jet pilots ."
9009,Lockheed said the U.S. Navy may also buy an additional 340 trainer aircraft to replace its T34C trainers made by the Beech Aircraft Corp. unit of Raytheon Corp .
9010,"Under the agreement with Lockheed , Aermacchi will license Lockheed to build the Aermacchi MB - 339 jet tandem - trainer and will supply certain structures ."
9011,"Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem - seat trainer at its Marietta , Ga. , plant should the Air Force order the craft ."
9012,"A Lockheed spokesman in Burbank , Calif. , said he was n't aware of which other companies would be competing for the Air Force contract ."
9013,Striking auto workers ended their 19 - day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital .
9014,But the Peugeot breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government 's ability to pay its bills .
9015,"The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop , which makes auto parts , at the plant in Mulhouse after voting 589 to 193 to abandon the occupation ."
9016,Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises .
9017,"The strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman ."
9018,Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job - rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise .
9019,"The market for $ 200 billion of high - risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year , practically vanished Friday ."
9020,"Trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers ."
9021,"Stunned , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades ."
9022,"`` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. Sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund ."
9023,"This calamity is `` far from over , '' he says ."
9024,"Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one - day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash ."
9025,"Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest - quality securities they could find ."
9026,"But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high - yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc ."
9027,"For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar ."
9028,"But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland , the owner of the nationwide chain of 7 - 11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash ."
9029,Goldman officials declined to comment .
9030,"Junk bonds , which mushroomed from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments ."
9031,"The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing ."
9032,Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department - store chain up for sale .
9033,"Now , dozens of corporations , including Ethan Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy - outs afloat , may never get the money ."
9034,"`` The music has stopped playing , '' says Michael Harkins , a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins ."
9035,`` You 've either got a chair or you do n't . ''
9036,"In Friday 's aftermath , says R. Douglas Carleton , a director of high - yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . ''"
9037,"In August , First Boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were `` very skittish . ''"
9038,"The outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors , says King Penniman , senior vice president at McCarthy , Crisanti & Maffei , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services ."
9039,"Indeed , a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high - yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday ."
9040,"In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 12/32 , its biggest gain of the year ."
9041,"The bond 's yield dropped to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group ."
9042,"The yield on three - month Treasury bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16 % , the largest one - day decline since 1982 ."
9043,The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
9044,"`` When you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said Maria Ramirez , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc ."
9045,"Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead ."
9046,"`` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says William Sullivan , director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , New York ."
9047,Any sustained credit - easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities .
9048,"Robert Dow , a partner and portfolio manager at Lord , Abbett & Co. , which manages $ 4 billion of high - yield bonds , says he does n't `` think there is any fundamental economic rationale -LCB- for the junk bond rout -RCB- ."
9049,It was herd instinct . ''
9050,He adds : `` The junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk .
9051,"I do n't believe that 's the case , but I believe that people are running scared ."
9052,"There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . ''"
9053,"Even as trading in high - yield issues dried up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion of new junk bonds ."
9054,"For example , a recent $ 375 million offering of Petrolane Gas Services L.P. bonds sold by First Boston was three times oversubscribed ."
9055,A $ 550 million offering of Turner Broadcasting System Inc . high - yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased $ 50 million because of strong demand .
9056,"First Boston estimates that in November and December alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion of coupon interest payments ."
9057,"`` That 's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on , '' says Mr. Carleton of First Boston ."
9058,"`` I do n't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $ 1.5 billion of orders for $ 550 million of junk bonds sold last week by Turner , '' says Raymond Minella , co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co ."
9059,"`` When the rally comes , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will ."
9060,There is plenty of money available from people who want to buy well - structured deals ; it 's the stuff that 's financed on a shoestring that people are wary of . ''
9061,"But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied this year , casting a pall over much of the junk market ."
9062,"Michael McNamara , director of fixed - income research at Kemper Financial Services , says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer , contributing to the slide in prices ."
9063,"`` Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says ."
9064,"`` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six ."
9065,And our credit standards have n't changed one iota . ''
9066,"However , Mr. McNamara said the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers ."
9067,"For the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk ."
9068,"`` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch ."
9069,`` That really affected the market in that people started to ask ` What else is in trouble ? ' ''
9070,"Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever ."
9071,"Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news :"
9072,"-- In June , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion of speculative debt securities , New York - based Integrated Resources Inc. said it ran out of borrowed money ."
9073,"-- In July , Southmark Corp. , the Dallas - based real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law ."
9074,"-- By the end of July , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven - year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points ."
9075,"-- In August , Resorts International Inc. , which sold more than $ 500 million of junk bonds , suspended interest payments ."
9076,"-- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $ 145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion of debt securities ."
9077,"Meantime , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating ."
9078,Moody 's says the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since 1982 .
9079,"In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ."
9080,"`` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , an early critic of the junk bond market ."
9081,`` What we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest .
9082,Businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings .
9083,What we 're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative - grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . ''
9084,Friday 's Market Activity
9085,Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market .
9086,"The benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond was quoted 6 p.m. EDT at 103 12/32 , compared with 100 27/32 Thursday , up 2 1/2 points ."
9087,"The yield on the benchmark fell to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group ."
9088,The `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market .
9089,"Treasurys opened lower , reacting negatively to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in September ."
9090,Bond prices barely budged until midday .
9091,"Many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the Federal Reserve , which might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession ."
9092,"Prices of municipals , investment - grade corporates and mortgage - backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts ."
9093,"Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue ."
9094,"The Ginnie Mae November 9 % issue ended at 98 25/32 , up 7/8 point on the day , to yield about 9.28 % to a 12 - year average life assumption ."
9095,Investment - grade corporate bonds were up about 1/2 to 3/4 point .
9096,"But the yield spread between lower - quality , investment - grade issues and higher - quality bonds widened ."
9097,And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment - grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority .
9098,"Despite rumors that the TVA 's long - awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled ."
9099,One of the sources said the smaller portions of $ 750 million each of five - year and 10 - year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . ''
9100,Municipal bonds rose as much as 3/4 point .
9101,Roger Lowenstein contributed to this article .
9102,"Friday 's 190 - point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly ."
9103,"Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked by Washington ."
9104,"The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt ."
9105,"Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business ."
9106,This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut .
9107,"The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- ."
9108,And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month .
9109,"An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut ."
9110,"There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill ."
9111,It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one - by - one on their individual merits without trickery .
9112,"For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up - or - down vote ."
9113,"Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect ."
9114,Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco .
9115,"To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's sticky fingers ."
9116,"As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them ."
9117,"But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes ."
9118,"Worse , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon ."
9119,"James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids ."
9120,It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more .
9121,"So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points ."
9122,"Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman ."
9123,"In the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance ."
9124,"Even more important , in our view , was the Treasury 's threat to thrash the dollar ."
9125,"The Treasury is doing the same thing today ; thankfully , the dollar is not under 1987 - style pressure ."
9126,"Also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling binges ."
9127,They are better capitalized .
9128,They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays .
9129,The Fed promises any needed liquidity .
9130,The Big Board 's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove to be a good idea .
9131,"In any event , some traders see stocks as underpriced today , unlike 1987 ."
9132,There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington .
9133,"But on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect ."
9134,First Chicago Corp. posted a third - quarter loss of $ 23.3 million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans .
9135,"The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion in assets , said it set aside $ 200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries ."
9136,"The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign - loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium - term and long - term loans outstanding to troubled nations ."
9137,First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion .
9138,"Despite this loss , First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital ."
9139,"During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ 60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit ."
9140,"Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million from $ 50.5 million ."
9141,"Gains from First Chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy - out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million from $ 25.7 million a year ago ."
9142,Interest income and most fee income was strong .
9143,Greece 's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5 .
9144,For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight - year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three - month hitch with a conservative - communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass .
9145,"In the mid-June round of voting , Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party ."
9146,"The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill - conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center - right New Democracy Party , headed by Constantine Mitsotakis ."
9147,"On the other , the so - called Coalition of the Left and Progress -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro - Communist cousin , the Hellenic Left ."
9148,The unifying bond for this left - right mismatch was plain : PASOK -LRB- Mr. Papandreou 's party -RRB- as common political enemy .
9149,"The ostensible goal was a mop - up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates ."
9150,"In point of fact , this catharsis was overdue by decades ."
9151,"When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges , however , the notion transmogrified into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice ."
9152,"With regard to Greece 's long - bubbling bank - looting scandal , Mr. Papandreou 's principal accuser remains George Koskotas , former owner of the Bank of Crete and self - confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in Salem , Mass. , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece ."
9153,"Mr. Koskotas 's credibility is , at best , problematic ."
9154,"He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points ."
9155,"Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity ."
9156,"Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched ."
9157,Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court .
9158,But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers .
9159,"In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that point to PASOK , not clinching proof ."
9160,"On another issue , Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency , the EYP , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and PASOK cabinet members ."
9161,"Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps ."
9162,The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks .
9163,"The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F - 16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France 's Avions Marcel Dassault , respectively ."
9164,"Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid -LRB- or not -RRB- to various Greek officials for services rendered ."
9165,"So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense ."
9166,"But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated ."
9167,First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right - wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece .
9168,"Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner ."
9169,"Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left - right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well - respected Communist Party candidate ."
9170,"For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis ."
9171,"Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal - stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers ."
9172,"Crucial as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle ."
9173,"The country 's future NATO participation remains unsure , for instance ."
9174,Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation .
9175,Greece 's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well .
9176,"For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece lapses in May 1990 ."
9177,"Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the June elections , but the clock is running ."
9178,"Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid , a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight ."
9179,"The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case , but the matter awaits final approval from Greece 's next justice minister ."
9180,The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism .
9181,"That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable ; the Greek press , previously eager to palm off PASOK 's line , has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild - eyed vengeance ."
9182,Yet the possibility of another lash - up government is all too real .
9183,"If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader , he could hamstring a conservative - led coalition ."
9184,"Also , he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March ."
9185,"New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles ."
9186,As for Mr. Papandreou ?
9187,He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage .
9188,"But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated ."
9189,"Mr. Carpenter , a regional correspondent for National Review , has lived in Athens since 1981 ."
9190,U.S. OFFICIALS MOVED to head off any repeat of Black Monday today following Friday 's plunge in stock prices .
9191,Fed Chairman Greenspan signaled that the central bank was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system to prevent a financial crisis .
9192,"Other U.S. and foreign officials also mapped out plans , though they kept their moves quiet to avoid making the financial markets more jittery ."

9195,"The junk bond market came to a standstill , while Treasury bonds soared and the dollar fell ."
9196,"Japanese stocks dropped early Monday , but by late morning were turning around ."
9197,The dollar was trading sharply lower in Tokyo .
9198,Prospects for a new UAL buy - out proposal appear bleak .
9199,"Many banks refused to back the $ 6.79 billion transaction , but bankers said it was not from any unwillingness to finance takeovers ."
9200,"The decision was based solely on problems with the UAL management - pilot plan , they said ."
9201,"The surge in producer prices in September followed three months of declines , but analysts were divided on whether the 0.9 % jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation ."
9202,"Also , retail sales grew 0.5 % last month ."
9203,"A capital - gains tax cut was removed from the Senate 's deficit reduction bill , but proponents still hope to enact the cut this year ."
9204,Bush wo n't press for a capital - gains provision in the final deficit bill when House - Senate conferees meet later this week .

9238,"Roger Rosenblatt , editor of U.S. News & World Report , resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine ."
9239,Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine 's editorial offices in Washington .
9240,"`` Frankly , I missed my family , '' said Mr. Rosenblatt ."
9241,"In Mr. Rosenblatt 's tenure , the magazine 's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly ."

9249,Avions Marcel Dassault - Breguet Aviation S.A. said group profit before taxes and contributions to employee profit - sharing soared 97 % to 839 million francs -LRB- $ 129.6 million -RRB- in the first half of 1989 from 425 million francs a year earlier .
9250,"The French aircraft group pointed out , however , that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts ."
9251,"It noted , for example , that group revenue for the first half was 8.734 billion francs , down about 12 % from 9.934 billion francs a year earlier ."
9252,"Still , it said it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the order of 20 billion francs , reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year ."
9253,"For all of 1988 , Dassault had group profit of 428 million francs on revenue of 18.819 billion francs ."
9254,"The group has n't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989 , nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full - year earnings ."
9255,"Freeport - McMoRan Inc. said a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium - recovery facility in Donaldsonville , La. , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport - McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit ."
9256,The company did n't elaborate .
9257,"The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant , but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves ."
9258,"More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years ."
9259,"A second uranium - recovery plant at Uncle Sam , La. , that produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually , will continue to operate ."
9260,"Freeport - McMoRan said the shutdown wo n't affect sales volumes under long - term sales contracts of its Freeport Uranium Recovery Co. unit , but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market ."

9262,Business Week subscribers may hear this week 's issue talking back to them .
9263,"A four - page ad from Texas Instruments Inc. , running in approximately 140,000 issues of the Oct. 20 `` Corporate Elite '' issue of the McGraw - Hill Inc. publication , contains a speech synthesizer laminated between two of the pages ."
9264,"Readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human - sounding -- voice announce , `` I am the talking chip , '' as it launches into a 15 - second discourse on its own attributes ."
9265,"The talking chip is n't cheap -- the per - ad cost to Texas Instruments is about $ 4 , and that 's without adding in Business Week 's charge -- but Texas Instruments believes it is a first ."
9266,"Previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone - generating chips that play a tune , but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for example , when calling telephone directory services ."
9267,"And for those who miss the message the first time around , not to worry : Three tiny batteries provide enough juice for as many as 650 replays ."
9268,"Lomas Financial Corp. , Dallas , said it will ask a U.S. bankruptcy court to allow it to hire Lazard Freres & Co. to help it sell its leasing unit ."
9269,"Lomas , assisted by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , has been trying to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing Co. for several months , apparently without success ."
9270,The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt .
9271,"Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank - credit agreement , Lomas defaulted on $ 145 million in notes that became due Sept. 1 ."
9272,It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its $ 1.45 billion in senior debt .
9273,"Lomas said Merrill Lynch , which owns bonds and equity in Lomas , could n't continue as Lomas 's investment banker because it is also a creditor ."
9274,"It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard 's offices in Europe and Japan , where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company ."
9275,"Of all the one - time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease ."
9276,"To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms ."
9277,It must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective .
9278,"Specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities ."
9279,"When a regional economy catches cold , the local real - estate market gets pneumonia ."
9280,"In other words , real - estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession ."
9281,This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York .
9282,"But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real - estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy ."
9283,Why do local real - estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ?
9284,Because real - estate purchases and leases are such major long - term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .
9285,"Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment ."
9286,Area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % .
9287,"However , the real - estate market was hurt even more ."
9288,"For example , residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level ."
9289,"Once metropolitan Detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s , real estate rebounded ."
9290,"Building permits , for example , soared a staggering 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 ."
9291,"Where , savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ?"
9292,"Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real - estate markets in the nation ."
9293,"Of course , some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play ."
9294,But now appears to be the time to act .
9295,Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak .
9296,"In the mid-1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % ."
9297,The real - estate market suffered even more severe setbacks .
9298,Office construction dropped 97 % .
9299,"The vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant ."
9300,"To some observers , the empty office buildings of Houston 's `` see - through skyline '' were indicative of a very troubled economy ."
9301,"As usual , the real - estate market had overreacted ."
9302,"Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation ."
9303,Metropolitan Houston 's population has held steady over the past six years .
9304,"And personal income , after slumping in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms ."
9305,"Today , metropolitan Houston 's real - estate market is poised for a significant turnaround ."
9306,"More than 42,000 jobs were added in metro Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry ."
9307,This growth puts Houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year .
9308,And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average .
9309,"Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real - estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston ."
9310,"By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years ."
9311,"Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle ."
9312,Employment is now 4 % higher than in 1983 .
9313,Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 -LRB- the most recent year available -RRB- .
9314,"The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy ."
9315,"In a self - fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real - estate market all but collapsed in recent years ."
9316,Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks .
9317,"Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real - estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport ."
9318,"When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real - estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound ."
9319,What real - estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ?
9320,"Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles ."
9321,Vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years .
9322,"Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia ."
9323,Those looking for real - estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short - term -LRB- three - year -RRB- lease and wait for the bargains ahead .
9324,"Mr. Leinberger is managing partner of a real - estate advisory firm based in Beverly Hills , Calif ."
9325,"Kysor Industrial Corp. said it expects its third - quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share , compared with 61 cents a share a year ago ."
9326,Analysts had been projecting that the company 's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents a share .
9327,The year - earlier third - quarter earnings amounted to $ 4.1 million .
9328,The company said a drop in activity in the powerboat industry reduced sales volume at its two marine - related operations .
9329,"Also , the company said its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts ."
9330,"Kysor , a maker of heavy - duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment , said it expects its fourth - quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share ."
9331,Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift - industry regulators for him .
9332,"Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency ."
9333,"Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self - styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona ."
9334,Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause .
9335,I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . ''
9336,"In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln ."
9337,"According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . ''"
9338,Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous .
9339,"The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . ''"
9340,"For the next two years , the Bank Board , which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent ."
9341,"Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy - law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day ."
9342,"The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. , successor to the Bank Board , filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15 ."
9343,"Mr. Keating has filed his own suit , alleging that his property was taken illegally ."
9344,The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ 2.5 billion .
9345,"Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers ."
9346,"In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign , Sen. Riegle , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , returned $ 76,000 in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators ."
9347,"Sen. DeConcini , after months of fending off intense press criticism , returned $ 48,000 only last month , shortly after the government formally accused Mr. Keating of defrauding Lincoln ."
9348,"In addition , Sen. McCain last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid $ 13,433 to American Continental as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to Mr. Keating 's vacation home at Cat Cay , the Bahamas , from 1984 through 1986 ."
9349,Sen. McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the cracks . ''
9350,"Mr. Keating , his family members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to Sen. McCain 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts ."
9351,"But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted ."
9352,"`` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain recalls ."
9353,"In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax - exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . ''"
9354,"In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get - out - the - vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year ."
9355,"Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn ."
9356,"That was in addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator ."
9357,"Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright ."
9358,"Wilson Abney , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment ."
9359,"Sen. Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . ''"
9360,"Sen. McCain said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent ."
9361,Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee . ''
9362,"Sen. DeConcini said , `` When all is said and done , I expect to be fully exonerated . ''"
9363,"Sen. Cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act ."
9364,`` Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner ? '' he said .
9365,`` That is what Common Cause should ask be investigated .
9366,"Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture 1,000 coal rail cars for Norfolk Southern Corp ."
9367,Trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than $ 40 million .
9368,Trinity said it plans to begin delivery of the rail cars in the first quarter of 1990 .
9369,"It said the 1,000 rail cars are in addition to the 1,450 coal rail cars presently being produced for Norfolk Southern , a Norfolk , Va. - based railroad concern ."
9370,"When China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979 , toy makers from Hong Kong were among the first to march in ."
9371,"Today , with about 75 % of the companies ' products being made in China , the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council , Dennis Ting , has suggested a new sourcing label : `` Made in China by Hong Kong Companies . ''"
9372,The toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the British colony .
9373,"But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June 4 , the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China ."
9374,"Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by China 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites ."
9375,"The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies ."
9376,"`` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd ."
9377,"Indeed , Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the massacre ."
9378,Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China .
9379,"By diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers say ."
9380,It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade .
9381,"A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site ."
9382,"`` South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says Henry Hu , executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd ."
9383,Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border .
9384,"In 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ 10.05 billion -LRB- US$ 1.29 billion -RRB- ."
9385,"But re-exports , mainly from China , jumped 75 % , to HK$ 15.92 billion ."
9386,"In 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to HK$ 3.87 billion , while re-exports rose 56 % , to HK$ 11.28 billion ."
9387,"Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China , where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry ."
9388,"`` For the next few years , like it or not , China is going to be the main supplier , '' says Edmund Young , vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border ."
9389,"In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia ."
9390,"Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including Matchbox , Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting ."
9391,"Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied ."
9392,"With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites ."
9393,"Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc ."
9394,"Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management ."
9395,The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results .
9396,"Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games ."
9397,The closest thing the colony 's companies have to a U.S. mega-hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured by Playmates Holdings Ltd .
9398,"Introduced in mid-1988 , the 15 - centimeter - tall plastic turtles are based on an American comic book and television series ."
9399,"Paul Kwan , managing director of Playmates , says 10 million Ninja Turtles have been sold , placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest - selling toys in the U.S. ."
9400,"Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. Kwan said the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates ."
9401,Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 .
9402,"Besides the lack of a fast - selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan ."
9403,Nintendo buyers have little money left to spend on other products .
9404,Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing 's austerity programs launched late last year .
9405,"Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity ."
9406,Manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants .
9407,Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4 .
9408,"Also , concern exists that the harder - line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong , which has been the main laboratory for the open - door policy and economic reforms ."
9409,"But , toy manufacturers and other industrialists say Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export - oriented southern China ."
9410,They say China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong .
9411,"`` The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says Mr. Kwan of Playmates ."
9412,"The Bush administration , urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions , said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents ."
9413,"Solicitor General Kenneth Starr argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision , Roe vs. Wade , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect ."
9414,He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that minors have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents .
9415,The administration 's position was outlined in a friend - of - the - court brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term .
9416,The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion .
9417,The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions .
9418,"Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it ."
9419,"That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion ."
9420,"On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead ."
9421,"The case , Hodgson vs. Minnesota , will be argued Nov. 29 ."
9422,"For 20 years , federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest - growing parts of the television business ."
9423,"And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that ."
9424,"But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever ."
9425,They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air .
9426,"Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon ."
9427,"And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the `` fin - syn '' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules ."
9428,"That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co. , backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co. , had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd. 's now - scuttled $ 1.5 billion bid for MGM / UA Communications Co ."
9429,"NBC 's interest may revive the deal , which MGM / UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash ."
9430,"Even if that deal is n't revived , NBC hopes to find another ."
9431,"`` Our doors are open , '' an NBC spokesman says ."
9432,"NBC may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a program - maker without violating the rules ."
9433,"And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC 's parent , Capital Cities / ABC Inc. , to look for ways of skirting the fin - syn regulations ."
9434,But the networks ' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios .
9435,Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin - syn restraints .
9436,Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge .
9437,"The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules ."
9438,"Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime - time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends ."
9439,"And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says ."
9440,"Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed ."
9441,"But Mr. Valenti , who represents the studios , asserts : `` The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving '' the rules ."
9442,Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend .
9443,"`` They do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate , '' says one network executive ."
9444,`` And there 's no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules .
9445,"That 's the problem , is n't it ? ''"
9446,Indeed it is .
9447,"Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise ."
9448,"But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive ."
9449,"The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million ."
9450,"`` I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony / Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo , '' wrote J.B. Holston , an NBC vice president , in a commentary in last week 's issue of Broadcasting magazine ."
9451,"In his article , Mr. Holston , who was in Europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` archaic restraints '' in fin - syn rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises ."
9452,"'' -LRB- He did n't mention that NBC , in the meantime , was hoping to assist Australia 's Qintex in buying"
9453,An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston 's lament was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be `` light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . ''
9454,The Big Three 's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner .
9455,"Although Time already had a long - term contract to buy movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely unregulated pay - cable channel , Home Box Office , own the Warner movies aired on HBO -- a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin - syn regulations ."
9456,NBC 's Mr. Wright led the way in decrying the networks ' inability to match a Time - Warner combination .
9457,He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced .
9458,"Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM / UA was disclosed , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment ."
9459,"With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into uncharted territory -- possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington ."
9460,"`` It 's never really been tested , '' says William Lilley III , who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted ."
9461,"He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , consulting to media companies ."
9462,"Fin - syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy ."
9463,"Hence , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM / UA ."
9464,"If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake ."
9465,But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication .
9466,"Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a 100 % - owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime / comedy `` Moonlighting '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations ."
9467,"Instead , ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one - time fee ."
9468,The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim -- for several years at the least .
9469,Six years ago they were tantalizingly close .
9470,The Reagan - era Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules .
9471,"Various evidence , including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged ."
9472,"But just eight days before the rules were to die , former President Ronald Reagan , a one - time actor , intervened on behalf of Hollywood ."
9473,The FCC effort collapsed .
9474,The networks and studios have bickered ever since .
9475,"Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington , but that seems unlikely ."
9476,"In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue ."
9477,"A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D - Mass. -RRB- , who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC , says Mr. Markey feels `` the world has been forever changed by the Sony - Columbia deal . ''"
9478,But he said Mr. Markey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own .
9479,"And at the FCC , meanwhile , new Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan ."
9480,Recognition Equipment Inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the U.S. Postal Service .
9481,"The government sued the company in April , seeking $ 23,000 and other unspecified damages related to an alleged contract - steering scheme ."
9482,"The suit named the company , former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr. , former vice president Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who were n't part of the company ."
9483,"The suit charged the defendants with causing Peter E. Voss , an ex-member of the Postal Service board of governors , to accept $ 23,000 in bribes , kickbacks and gratuities ."
9484,"Mr. Voss was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ 11,000 for his role in the scheme ."
9485,"In the agreement , Recognition agreed to pay the government $ 20,000 in return for the release of all claims against the company , Mr. Moore and Mr. Reedy ."
9486,The five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement .
9487,A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia .
9488,"They were indicted last October on charges of fraud , theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ 400 million in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment ."
9489,The company and its executives deny the charges .
9490,"In a related development , Recognition Equipment said the Postal Service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days ."
9491,"The Postal Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7 , 1988 , and has been renewing the ban ever since ."
9492,The company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension .
9493,Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday .
9494,"After 26 years in prison , Mr. Sisulu , the 77 - year - old former secretary - general of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up ."
9495,"At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their families at various places around the country ."
9496,"And as the graying men returned to their homes , the ANC , outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships ."
9497,"A huge ANC flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts , caps and scarves ."
9498,"At the small four - room home of Elias Motsoaledi , a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe , well - wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons ."
9499,"`` I am happy to see the spirit of the people , '' said Mr. Sisulu , looking dapper in a new gray suit ."
9500,"As the crowd outside his home shouted `` ANC , ANC , '' the old man shot his fists into the air ."
9501,`` I 'm inspired by the mood of the people . ''
9502,"Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in Lusaka , Zambia ."
9503,"But the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing ."
9504,"`` The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , '' said Cassim Saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu ."
9505,`` Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now .
9506,There 's no turning back . ''
9507,"There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night , when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years ."
9508,"Deafening chants of `` ANC '' and `` Umkhonto we Sizwe '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle ."
9509,"And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison ."
9510,"Without him , said Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others `` is only a half - measure . ''"
9511,"President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government ."
9512,But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .
9513,"As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control ."
9514,"As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency ."
9515,"If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest ."
9516,"If it does , the large number of right - wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands ."
9517,The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure .
9518,"The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars ."
9519,Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government .
9520,"In addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment ."
9521,"In order to head off any divisions , Mr. Mandela , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible ."
9522,"The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths , the so - called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action ."
9523,"Says Peter Mokaba , president of the South African Youth Congress : `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC . ''"
9524,They never considered themselves to be anything else .
9525,"At last night 's rally , they called on their followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid ."
9526,"`` We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said Andrew Mlangeni , another early Umkhonto leader who is now 63 ."
9527,"`` We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us ."
9528,"Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 16th"
9529,"Recently , the Import and Export Bank of China won a bond credit rating of AA - in Japan , which is currently the highest bond rating given to a Chinese bank by the Japanese financial market ."

9950,Jesus called his twelve followers together .
9951,He gave them power over evil spirits and power to heal every kind of disease and sickness .

9972,"But if they do n't welcome you , they are not worthy of your peace ."
9973,Take back the peace you wished for them .
9974,"And if the people in a home or a town refuse to welcome you or listen to you , then leave that place and shake the dust off your feet ."
9975,I can assure you that on the judgment day it will be worse for that town than for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah .

9983,You will be taken to stand before governors and kings .
9984,People will do this to you because you follow me .

9986,"When you are arrested , do n't worry about what to say or how you should say it ."

10025,Those who will not accept the cross that is given to them when they follow me are not worthy of me .
10026,Those who try to keep the life they have will lose it .
10027,But those who give up their life for me will find true life .

10033,`` God 's kingdom is like a man who owned some land .
10034,"One morning , the man went out very early to hire some people to work in his vineyard ."
10035,He agreed to pay the workers one silver coin for working that day .
10036,Then he sent them into the vineyard to work .
10037,`` About nine o'clock the man went to the marketplace and saw some other people standing there .
10038,They were doing nothing .
10039,"So he said to them , ' If you go and work in my field , I will pay you what your work is worth . '"
10040,So they went to work in the vineyard .
10041,`` The man went out again about twelve o'clock and again at three o'clock .
10042,Both times he hired some others to work in his vineyard .
10043,About five o'clock the man went to the marketplace again .
10044,He saw some other people standing there .
10045,"He asked them , ' Why did you stand here all day doing nothing ? '"
10046,"`` They said , ' No one gave us a job . '"
10047,"`` The man said to them , ' Then you can go and work in my vineyard . '"
10048,"`` At the end of the day , the owner of the field said to the boss of all the workers , ' Call the workers and pay them all ."
10049,Start by paying the last people I hired .
10050,"Then pay all of them , ending with the ones I hired first . '"
10051,`` The workers who were hired at five o'clock came to get their pay .
10052,Each worker got one silver coin .
10053,Then the workers who were hired first came to get their pay .
10054,They thought they would be paid more than the others .
10055,But each one of them also received one silver coin .
10056,"When they got their silver coin , they complained to the man who owned the land ."
10057,"They said , ' Those people were hired last and worked only one hour ."
10058,But you paid them the same as us .
10059,And we worked hard all day in the hot sun . '
10060,"`` But the man who owned the field said to one of them , ' Friend , I am being fair with you ."
10061,You agreed to work for one silver coin .
10062,Right ?
10063,So take your pay and go .
10064,I want to give the man who was hired last the same pay I gave you .
10065,I can do what I want with my own money .
10066,Why would you be jealous because I am generous ? '
10067,`` So those who are last now will be first in the future .
10068,And those who are first now will be last in the future . ''
10069,Jesus was going to Jerusalem .
10070,His twelve followers were with him .
10071,"While they were walking , he gathered the followers together and spoke to them privately ."
10072,"He said to them , `` We are going to Jerusalem ."
10073,"The Son of Man will be handed over to the leading priests and the teachers of the law , and they will say he must die ."
10074,"They will hand him over to the foreigners , who will laugh at him and beat him with whips , and then they will kill him on a cross ."
10075,"But on the third day after his death , he will be raised to life again . ''"
10076,Then Zebedee 's wife came to Jesus and brought her sons .
10077,She bowed before Jesus and asked him to do something for her .
10078,"Jesus said , `` What do you want ? ''"
10079,"She said , `` Promise that one of my sons will sit at your right side in your kingdom and the other at your left . ''"
10080,"So Jesus said to the sons , `` You do n't understand what you are asking ."
10081,Can you drink from the cup that I must drink from ? ''
10082,"The sons answered , `` Yes , we can ! ''"
10083,"Jesus said to them , `` It is true that you will drink from the cup that I drink from ."
10084,But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left .
10085,My Father has decided who will do that .
10086,He has prepared those places for them . ''
10087,The other ten followers heard this and were angry with the two brothers .
10088,So Jesus called the followers together .
10089,"He said , `` You know that the rulers of the non-Jewish people love to show their power over the people ."
10090,And their important leaders love to use all their authority over the people .
10091,But it should not be that way with you .
10092,Whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant .
10093,Whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave .
10094,Do as I did : The Son of Man did not come for people to serve him .
10095,He came to serve others and to give his life to save many people . ''
10096,"When Jesus and his followers were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed him ."
10097,There were two blind men sitting by the road .
10098,They heard that Jesus was coming by .
10099,"So they shouted , `` Lord , Son of David , please help us ! ''"
10100,The people there criticized the blind men and told them to be quiet .
10101,"But they shouted more and more , `` Lord , Son of David , please help us ! ''"
10102,"Jesus stopped and said to them , `` What do you want me to do for you ? ''"
10103,"They answered , `` Lord , we want to be able to see . ''"
10104,Jesus felt sorry for the blind men .
10105,"He touched their eyes , and immediately they were able to see ."
10106,Then they became followers of Jesus .
10107,Then Jesus left there and went into the area of Judea and across the Jordan River .
10108,"Again , many people came to him , and Jesus taught them as he always did ."
10109,Some Pharisees came to Jesus and tried to make him say something wrong .
10110,"They asked him , `` Is it right for a man to divorce his wife ? ''"
10111,"Jesus answered , `` What did Moses command you to do ? ''"
10112,"The Pharisees said , `` Moses allowed a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce . ''"
10113,"Jesus said , `` Moses wrote that command for you because you refused to accept God 's teaching ."
10114,"But when God made the world , ' he made people male and female . '"
10115,' That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife .
10116,And the two people will become one . '
10117,"So they are no longer two , but one ."
10118,"God has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ''"
10119,"Later , when the followers and Jesus were in the house , they asked him again about the question of divorce ."
10120,"He said , `` Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman has sinned against his wife ."
10121,He is guilty of adultery .
10122,And the woman who divorces her husband and marries another man is also guilty of adultery . ''
10123,"People brought their small children to Jesus , so that he could lay his hands on them to bless them ."
10124,But the followers told the people to stop bringing their children to him .
10125,Jesus saw what happened .
10126,He did not like his followers telling the children not to come .
10127,"So he said to them , `` Let the little children come to me ."
10128,"Do n't stop them , because God 's kingdom belongs to people who are like these little children ."
10129,"The truth is , you must accept God 's kingdom like a little child accepts things , or you will never enter it . ''"
10130,Then Jesus held the children in his arms .
10131,He laid his hands on them and blessed them .
10132,"Jesus started to leave , but a man ran to him and bowed down on his knees before him ."
10133,"The man asked , `` Good Teacher , what must I do to get the life that never ends ? ''"
10134,"Jesus answered , `` Why do you call me good ?"
10135,Only God is good .
10136,"And you know his commands : ' You must not murder anyone , you must not commit adultery , you must not steal , you must not lie , you must not cheat , you must respect your father and mother . . . . ' ''"
10137,"The man said , `` Teacher , I have obeyed all these commands since I was a boy . ''"
10138,Jesus looked at the man in a way that showed how much he cared for him .
10139,"He said , `` There is still one thing you need to do ."
10140,Go and sell everything you have .
10141,"Give the money to those who are poor , and you will have riches in heaven ."
10142,Then come and follow me . ''
10143,The man was upset when Jesus told him to give away his money .
10144,"He did n't want to do this , because he was very rich ."
10145,So he went away sad .
10146,"Then Jesus looked at his followers and said to them , `` It will be very hard for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom ! ''"
10147,The followers were amazed at what Jesus said .
10148,"But he said again , `` My children , it is very hard to enter God 's kingdom !"
10149,It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom ! ''
10150,"The followers were even more amazed and said to each other , `` Then who can be saved ? ''"
10151,"Jesus looked at them and said , `` That is something people can not do , but God can ."
10152,He can do anything . ''
10153,"Peter said to Jesus , `` We left everything to follow you ! ''"
10154,"Jesus said , `` I can promise that everyone who has left their home , brothers , sisters , mother , father , children , or farm for me and for the Good News about me will get a hundred times more than they left ."
10155,"Here in this world they will get more homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and farms ."
10156,And with these things they will have persecutions .
10157,But in the world that is coming they will also get the reward of eternal life .
10158,Many people who have the highest place now will have the lowest place in the future .
10159,And the people who have the lowest place now will have the highest place then . ''
10160,Jesus and those with him were on their way to Jerusalem .
10161,He was at the front of the group .
10162,"His followers were wondering what was happening , and the people who followed behind them were feeling afraid ."
10163,Jesus gathered the twelve apostles again and talked with them alone .
10164,He told them what would happen in Jerusalem .
10165,"He said , `` We are going to Jerusalem ."
10166,The Son of Man will be handed over to the leading priests and teachers of the law .
10167,"They will say that he must die and will hand him over to the foreigners , who will laugh at him and spit on him ."
10168,They will beat him with whips and kill him .
10169,"But on the third day after his death , he will rise to life again . ''"
10170,"Then James and John , sons of Zebedee , came to Jesus and said , `` Teacher , we want to ask you to do something for us . ''"
10171,"Jesus asked , `` What do you want me to do for you ? ''"
10172,"The sons answered , `` Let us share the great honor you will have as king ."
10173,Let one of us sit at your right side and the other at your left . ''
10174,"Jesus said , `` You do n't understand what you are asking ."
10175,Can you drink from the cup that I must drink from ?
10176,Can you be baptized with the same baptism that I must go through ? ''
10177,"The sons answered , `` Yes , we can ! ''"
10178,"Jesus said to the sons , `` It is true that you will drink from the cup that I drink from ."
10179,And you will be baptized with the same baptism that I must go through .
10180,But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left .
10181,God has prepared those places for the ones he chooses . ''
10182,"When the other ten followers heard this , they were angry with James and John ."
10183,Jesus called all the followers together .
10184,"He said , `` The non-Jewish people have men they call rulers ."
10185,You know that those rulers love to show their power over the people .
10186,And their important leaders love to use all their authority over the people .
10187,But it should not be that way with you .
10188,Whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant .
10189,Whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave .
10190,Follow my example : Even the Son of Man did not come for people to serve him .
10191,He came to serve others and to give his life to save many people . ''
10192,Then they came to the town of Jericho .
10193,"When Jesus left there with his followers , a large crowd was with them ."
10194,A blind man named Bartimaeus -LRB- meaning `` son of Timaeus '' -RRB-
10195,was sitting by the road .
10196,He was always begging for money .
10197,He heard that Jesus from Nazareth was walking by .
10198,"So he began shouting , `` Jesus , Son of David , please help me ! ''"
10199,Many people criticized the blind man and told him to be quiet .
10200,"But he shouted more and more , `` Son of David , please help me ! ''"
10201,"Jesus stopped and said , `` Tell him to come here . ''"
10202,"So they called the blind man and said , `` You can be happy now ."
10203,Stand up !
10204,Jesus is calling you . ''
10205,The blind man stood up quickly .
10206,He left his coat there and went to Jesus .
10207,"Jesus asked the man , `` What do you want me to do for you ? ''"
10208,"He answered , `` Teacher , I want to see again . ''"
10209,"Jesus said , `` Go ."
10210,You are healed because you believed . ''
10211,Immediately the man was able to see again .
10212,He followed Jesus down the road .
10213,"After this , the Lord chose 72 more followers ."
10214,He sent them out in groups of two .
10215,He sent them ahead of him into every town and place where he planned to go .
10216,"He said to them , `` There is such a big harvest of people to bring in ."
10217,But there are only a few workers to help harvest them .
10218,God owns the harvest .
10219,Ask him to send more workers to help bring in his harvest .
10220,`` You can go now .
10221,But listen !
10222,"I am sending you , and you will be like sheep among wolves ."
10223,"Do n't carry any money , a bag , or sandals ."
10224,Do n't stop to talk with people on the road .
10225,"Before you go into a house , say , ' Peace be with this home . '"
10226,"If the people living there love peace , your blessing of peace will stay with them ."
10227,"But if not , your blessing of peace will come back to you ."
10228,Stay in the peace - loving house .
10229,Eat and drink what the people there give you .
10230,A worker should be given his pay .
10231,Do n't leave that house to stay in another house .
10232,"`` If you go into a town and the people welcome you , eat the food they give you ."
10233,"Heal the sick people who live there , and tell them , ' God 's kingdom is coming to you soon ! '"
10234,"`` But if you go into a town , and the people do n't welcome you , then go out into the streets of that town and say , ' Even the dirt from your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you ."
10235,But remember that God 's kingdom is coming soon . '
10236,"I tell you , on the judgment day it will be worse for the people of that town than for the people of Sodom ."
10237,"`` It will be bad for you , Chorazin !"
10238,"It will be bad for you , Bethsaida !"
10239,I did many miracles in you .
10240,"If those same miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon , then the people in those cities would have changed their lives and stopped sinning a long time ago ."
10241,They would have worn sackcloth and sat in ashes to show that they were sorry for their sins .
10242,But on the judgment day it will be worse for you than for Tyre and Sidon .
10243,"And you , Capernaum , will you be lifted up to heaven ?"
10244,"No , you will be thrown down to the place of death !"
10245,"`` When anyone listens to you my followers , they are really listening to me ."
10246,"But when anyone refuses to accept you , they are really refusing to accept me ."
10247,"And when anyone refuses to accept me , they are refusing to accept the one who sent me . ''"
10248,"When the 72 followers came back from their trip , they were very happy ."
10249,"They said , `` Lord , even the demons obeyed us when we used your name ! ''"
10250,"Jesus said to them , `` I saw Satan falling like lightning from the sky ."
10251,"He is the enemy , but know that I have given you more power than he has ."
10252,I have given you power to crush his snakes and scorpions under your feet .
10253,Nothing will hurt you .
10254,"Yes , even the spirits obey you ."
10255,"And you can be happy , not because you have this power , but because your names are written in heaven . ''"
10256,Then the Holy Spirit made Jesus feel very happy .
10257,"Jesus said , `` I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth ."
10258,I am thankful that you have hidden these things from those who are so wise and so smart .
10259,But you have shown them to people who are like little children .
10260,"Yes , Father , you did this because it 's what you really wanted to do ."
10261,`` My Father has given me all things .
10262,No one knows who the Son is -- only the Father knows .
10263,And only the Son knows who the Father is .
10264,The only people who will know about the Father are those the Son chooses to tell . ''
10265,Then Jesus turned to his followers .
10266,They were there alone with him .
10267,"He said , `` It is a great blessing for you to see what you now see !"
10268,"I tell you , many prophets and kings wanted to see what you now see , but they could not ."
10269,"And they wanted to hear what you now hear , but they could not . ''"
10270,Then an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus .
10271,"He said , `` Teacher , what must I do to get eternal life ? ''"
10272,"Jesus said to him , `` What is written in the law ?"
10273,What do you understand from it ? ''
10274,"The man answered , `` ' Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , all your strength , and all your mind . '"
10275,"Also , ' Love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ' ''"
10276,"Jesus said , `` Your answer is right ."
10277,Do this and you will have eternal life . ''
10278,But the man wanted to show that the way he was living was right .
10279,"So he said to Jesus , `` But who is my neighbor ? ''"
10280,"To answer this question , Jesus said , `` A man was going down the road from Jerusalem to Jericho ."
10281,"Some robbers surrounded him , tore off his clothes , and beat him ."
10282,Then they left him lying there on the ground almost dead .
10283,`` It happened that a Jewish priest was going down that road .
10284,"When he saw the man , he did not stop to help him ."
10285,He walked away .
10286,"Next , a Levite came near ."
10287,"He saw the hurt man , but he went around him ."
10288,He would not stop to help him either .
10289,He just walked away .
10290,`` Then a Samaritan man traveled down that road .
10291,He came to the place where the hurt man was lying .
10292,He saw the man and felt very sorry for him .
10293,The Samaritan went to him and poured olive oil and wine on his wounds .
10294,Then he covered the man 's wounds with cloth .
10295,The Samaritan had a donkey .
10296,"He put the hurt man on his donkey , and he took him to an inn ."
10297,There he cared for him .
10298,"The next day , the Samaritan took out two silver coins and gave them to the man who worked at the inn ."
10299,"He said , ' Take care of this hurt man ."
10300,"If you spend more money on him , I will pay it back to you when I come again . ' ''"
10301,"Then Jesus said , `` Which one of these three men do you think was really a neighbor to the man who was hurt by the robbers ? ''"
10302,"The teacher of the law answered , `` The one who helped him . ''"
10303,"Jesus said , `` Then you go and do the same . ''"
10304,"While Jesus and his followers were traveling , he went into a town , and a woman named Martha let him stay at her house ."
10305,She had a sister named Mary .
10306,Mary was sitting at Jesus ' feet and listening to him teach .
10307,But her sister Martha was busy doing all the work that had to be done .
10308,"Martha went in and said , `` Lord , do n't you care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself ?"
10309,Tell her to help me ! ''
10310,"But the Lord answered her , `` Martha , Martha , you are getting worried and upset about too many things ."
10311,Only one thing is important .
10312,"Mary has made the right choice , and it will never be taken away from her . ''"
10313,One day Jesus was in the Temple area teaching the people .
10314,He was telling them the Good News .
10315,"The leading priests , teachers of the law , and older Jewish leaders came to talk to Jesus ."
10316,"They said , `` Tell us what authority you have to do these things ."
10317,Who gave you this authority ? ''
10318,"Jesus answered , `` I will ask you a question too ."
10319,"Tell me : When John baptized people , did his authority come from God or was it only from other people ? ''"
10320,"The priests , the teachers of the law , and the Jewish leaders all talked about this ."
10321,"They said to each other , `` If we answer , ' John 's baptism was from God , ' then he will say , ' Then why did you not believe John ? '"
10322,"But if we say that John 's baptism was from someone else , the people will stone us to death ."
10323,They all believe that John was a prophet . ''
10324,"So they answered , `` We do n't know the answer . ''"
10325,"So Jesus said to them , `` Then I will not tell you who gave me the authority to do these things . ''"
10326,Then Jesus told the people this story : `` A man planted a vineyard .
10327,He leased the land to some farmers .
10328,Then he went away for a long time .
10329,"Later , it was time for the grapes to be picked ."
10330,So the man sent a servant to those farmers so that they would give him his share of the grapes .
10331,But they beat the servant and sent him away with nothing .
10332,So the man sent another servant .
10333,They beat this servant too and showed no respect for him .
10334,They sent the servant away with nothing .
10335,So the man sent a third servant to the farmers .
10336,They hurt this servant badly and threw him out .
10337,"`` The owner of the vineyard said , ' What will I do now ?"
10338,I will send my son .
10339,I love my son very much .
10340,Maybe the farmers will respect my son . '
10341,"When the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ' This is the owner 's son ."
10342,This vineyard will be his .
10343,"If we kill him , it will be ours . '"
10344,So the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him .
10345,`` What will the owner of the vineyard do ?
10346,He will come and kill those farmers .
10347,Then he will lease the land to some other farmers . ''
10348,"When the people heard this story , they said , `` This should never happen ! ''"
10349,"But Jesus looked into their eyes and said , `` Then what does this verse mean : ' The stone that the builders refused to accept became the cornerstone ' ?"
10350,Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken .
10351,"If that stone falls on you , it will crush you ! ''"
10352,"When the teachers of the law and the leading priests heard this story , they knew it was about them ."
10353,"So they wanted to arrest Jesus right then , but they were afraid of what the people would do ."
10354,So the Jewish leaders waited for the right time to get Jesus .
10355,"They sent some men to him , who pretended to be sincere ."
10356,They wanted to find something wrong with what Jesus said .
10357,"-LRB- If they found something wrong , then they could hand him over to the governor , who had the authority to arrest him . -RRB-"
10358,"So the men said to Jesus , `` Teacher , we know that what you say and teach is true ."
10359,It does n't matter who is listening -- you teach the same to all people .
10360,You always teach the truth about God 's way .
10361,"Tell us , is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ''"
10362,But Jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him .
10363,"He said to them , `` Show me a silver coin ."
10364,Whose name and picture are on it ? ''
10365,"They said , `` Caesar 's . ''"
10366,"He said to them , `` Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar , and give to God what belongs to God . ''"
10367,The men were amazed at his wise answer .
10368,They could say nothing .
10369,They were not able to trick Jesus there in front of the people .
10370,He said nothing they could use against him .
10371,Some Sadducees came to Jesus .
10372,-LRB- Sadducees believe that people will not rise from death . -RRB-
10373,"They asked him , `` Teacher , Moses wrote that if a married man dies and had no children , his brother must marry his widow ."
10374,Then they will have children for the dead brother .
10375,One time there were seven brothers .
10376,The first brother married a woman but died .
10377,He had no children .
10378,"Then the second brother married the woman , and he died ."
10379,"And the third brother married the woman , and he died ."
10380,The same thing happened with all the other brothers .
10381,They all died and had no children .
10382,The woman was the last to die .
10383,But all seven brothers married her .
10384,"So when people rise from death , whose wife will this woman be ? ''"
10385,"Jesus said to the Sadducees , `` On earth , people marry each other ."
10386,Some people will be worthy to be raised from death and live again after this life .
10387,In that life they will not marry .
10388,In that life people are like angels and can not die .
10389,"They are children of God , because they have been raised from death ."
10390,Moses clearly showed that people are raised from death .
10391,"When Moses wrote about the burning bush , he said that the Lord is ' the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . '"
10392,"So they were not still dead , because he is the God only of living people ."
10393,"Yes , to God they are all still living . ''"
10394,"Some of the teachers of the law said , `` Teacher , your answer was very good . ''"
10395,No one was brave enough to ask him another question .
10396,"Then Jesus said , `` Why do people say that the Christ is the Son of David ?"
10397,"In the book of Psalms , David himself says , ' The Lord God said to my Lord : Sit by me at my right side , and I will put your enemies under your power . '"
10398,David calls the Christ ' Lord . '
10399,So how can the Christ also be David 's son ? ''
10400,"While all the people were listening to Jesus , he said to his followers , `` Be careful of the teachers of the law ."
10401,They like to walk around wearing clothes that look important .
10402,And they love for people to show respect to them in the marketplaces .
10403,They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .
10404,But they cheat widows and take their homes .
10405,Then they try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers .
10406,God will punish them very much . ''
10407,"Jesus said , `` It is certainly true that when a man enters the sheep pen , he should use the gate ."
10408,"If he climbs in some other way , he is a robber ."
10409,He is trying to steal the sheep .
10410,But the man who takes care of the sheep enters through the gate .
10411,He is the shepherd .
10412,The man who guards the gate opens the gate for the shepherd .
10413,And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd .
10414,"He calls his own sheep , using their names , and he leads them out ."
10415,He brings all of his sheep out .
10416,Then he goes ahead of them and leads them .
10417,"The sheep follow him , because they know his voice ."
10418,But sheep will never follow someone they do n't know .
10419,"They will run away from him , because they do n't know his voice . ''"
10420,"Jesus told the people this story , but they did not understand what it meant ."
10421,"So Jesus said again , `` I assure you , I am the gate for the sheep ."
10422,All those who came before me were thieves and robbers .
10423,The sheep did not listen to them .
10424,I am the gate .
10425,Whoever enters through me will be saved .
10426,They will be able to come in and go out .
10427,They will find everything they need .
10428,"A thief comes to steal , kill , and destroy ."
10429,But I came to give life -- life that is full and good .
10430,"`` I am the good shepherd , and the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep ."
10431,The worker who is paid to keep the sheep is different from the shepherd .
10432,The paid worker does not own the sheep .
10433,"So when he sees a wolf coming , he runs away and leaves the sheep alone ."
10434,Then the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them .
10435,The man runs away because he is only a paid worker .
10436,He does not really care for the sheep .
10437,`` I am the shepherd who cares for the sheep .
10438,I know my sheep just as the Father knows me .
10439,And my sheep know me just as I know the Father .
10440,I give my life for these sheep .
10441,I have other sheep too .
10442,They are not in this flock here .
10443,I must lead them also .
10444,They will listen to my voice .
10445,In the future there will be one flock and one shepherd .
10446,The Father loves me because I give my life .
10447,I give my life so that I can get it back again .
10448,No one takes my life away from me .
10449,I give my own life freely .
10450,"I have the right to give my life , and I have the right to get it back again ."
10451,This is what the Father told me . ''
10452,Again the Jews were divided over what Jesus was saying .
10453,"Many of them said , `` A demon has come into him and made him crazy ."
10454,Why listen to him ? ''
10455,"But others said , `` These are n't the words of someone controlled by a demon ."
10456,A demon can not heal the eyes of a blind man . ''
10457,"It was winter , and the time came for the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem ."
10458,Jesus was in the Temple area at Solomon 's Porch .
10459,The Jewish leaders gathered around him .
10460,"They said , `` How long will you make us wonder about you ?"
10461,"If you are the Christ , then tell us clearly . ''"
10462,"Jesus answered , `` I told you already , but you did not believe ."
10463,I do miracles in my Father 's name .
10464,These miracles show who I am .
10465,"But you do not believe , because you are not my sheep ."
10466,My sheep listen to my voice .
10467,"I know them , and they follow me ."
10468,I give my sheep eternal life .
10469,"They will never die , and no one can take them out of my hand ."
10470,"My Father is the one who gave them to me , and he is greater than all ."
10471,No one can steal my sheep out of his hand .
10472,The Father and I are one . ''
10473,Again the Jews there picked up stones to kill Jesus .
10474,"But he said to them , `` The many wonderful things you have seen me do are from the Father ."
10475,Which of these good things are you killing me for ? ''
10476,"They answered , `` We are not killing you for any good thing you did ."
10477,But you say things that insult God .
10478,"You are only a man , but you say you are the same as God !"
10479,That is why we are trying to kill you ! ''
10480,"Jesus answered , `` It is written in your law that God said , ' I said you are gods . '"
10481,This Scripture called those people gods -- the people who received God 's message .
10482,And Scripture is always true .
10483,"So why do you accuse me of insulting God for saying , ' I am God 's Son ' ?"
10484,I am the one God chose and sent into the world .
10485,"If I do n't do what my Father does , then do n't believe what I say ."
10486,"But if I do what my Father does , you should believe in what I do ."
10487,"You might not believe in me , but you should believe in the things I do ."
10488,Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father . ''
10489,"They tried to get Jesus again , but he escaped from them ."
10490,Then he went back across the Jordan River to the place where John began his work of baptizing people .
10491,"Jesus stayed there , and many people came to him ."
10492,"They said , `` John never did any miraculous signs , but everything John said about this man is true . ''"
10493,And many people there believed in Jesus .
10494,"Early on Sunday morning , while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene went to the tomb ."
10495,She saw that the large stone was moved away from the entrance .
10496,So she ran to Simon Peter and the other follower -LRB- the one Jesus loved very much -RRB- .
10497,"She said , `` They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we do n't know where they put him . ''"
10498,So Peter and the other follower started going to the tomb .
10499,"They were both running , but the other follower ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first ."
10500,He bent down and looked in .
10501,"He saw the pieces of linen cloth lying there , but he did not go in ."
10502,Then Simon Peter finally reached the tomb and went in .
10503,He saw the pieces of linen lying there .
10504,He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus ' head .
10505,It was folded up and laid in a different place from the pieces of linen .
10506,Then the other follower went in -- the one who had reached the tomb first .
10507,He saw what had happened and believed .
10508,-LRB- These followers did not yet understand from the Scriptures that Jesus must rise from death . -RRB-
10509,Then the followers went back home .
10510,"But Mary stood outside the tomb , crying ."
10511,"While she was crying , she bent down and looked inside the tomb ."
10512,She saw two angels dressed in white sitting where Jesus ' body had been .
10513,One was sitting where the head had been ; the other was sitting where the feet had been .
10514,"The angels asked Mary , `` Woman , why are you crying ? ''"
10515,"Mary answered , `` They took away the body of my Lord , and I do n't know where they put him . ''"
10516,"When Mary said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there ."
10517,But she did not know that it was Jesus .
10518,"He asked her , `` Woman , why are you crying ?"
10519,Who are you looking for ? ''
10520,She thought that this was the man who takes care of the garden .
10521,"So she said to him , `` Did you take him away , sir ?"
10522,Tell me where you put him .
10523,I will go and get him . ''
10524,"Jesus said to her , `` Mary . ''"
10525,"She turned toward him and said in Aramaic , `` Rabboni , '' which means `` Teacher . ''"
10526,"Jesus said to her , `` You do n't need to hold on to me !"
10527,I have not yet gone back up to the Father .
10528,But go to my followers and tell them this : ' I am going back to my Father and your Father .
10529,I am going back to my God and your God . ' ''
10530,"Mary Magdalene went to the followers and told them , `` I saw the Lord ! ''"
10531,And she told them what he had said to her .
10532,"The day was Sunday , and that same evening the followers were together ."
10533,They had the doors locked because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders .
10534,"Suddenly , Jesus was standing there among them ."
10535,"He said , `` Peace be with you ! ''"
10536,"As soon as he said this , he showed them his hands and his side ."
10537,"When the followers saw the Lord , they were very happy ."
10538,"Then Jesus said again , `` Peace be with you ."
10539,"It was the Father who sent me , and I am now sending you in the same way . ''"
10540,"Then he breathed on them and said , `` Receive the Holy Spirit ."
10541,"If you forgive the sins of anyone , their sins are forgiven ."
10542,"If there is anyone whose sins you do n't forgive , their sins are not forgiven . ''"
10543,"Thomas -LRB- called Didymus -RRB- was one of the twelve , but he was not with the other followers when Jesus came ."
10544,"They told him , `` We saw the Lord . ''"
10545,"Thomas said , `` That 's hard to believe ."
10546,"I will have to see the nail holes in his hands , put my finger where the nails were , and put my hand into his side ."
10547,Only then will I believe it . ''
10548,"A week later the followers were in the house again , and Thomas was with them ."
10549,"The doors were locked , but Jesus came and stood among them ."
10550,"He said , `` Peace be with you ! ''"
10551,"Then he said to Thomas , `` Put your finger here ."
10552,Look at my hands .
10553,Put your hand here in my side .
10554,Stop doubting and believe . ''
10555,"Thomas said to Jesus , `` My Lord and my God ! ''"
10556,"Jesus said to him , `` You believe because you see me ."
10557,Great blessings belong to the people who believe without seeing me ! ''
10558,"Jesus did many other miraculous signs that his followers saw , which are not written in this book ."
10559,"But these are written so that you can believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ."
10560,"Then , by believing , you can have life through his name ."
10561,"In the city of Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius , a Roman army officer in what was called the Italian Unit ."
10562,He was a religious man .
10563,He and all the others who lived in his house were worshipers of the true God .
10564,He gave much of his money to help the poor people and always prayed to God .
10565,"One afternoon about three o'clock , Cornelius had a vision ."
10566,"He clearly saw an angel from God coming to him and saying , `` Cornelius ! ''"
10567,"Staring at the angel and feeling afraid , Cornelius said , `` What do you want , sir ? ''"
10568,"The angel said to him , `` God has heard your prayers and has seen your gifts to the poor ."
10569,He remembers you and all you have done .
10570,"Send some men now to the city of Joppa to get a man named Simon , who is also called Peter ."
10571,"He is staying with someone also named Simon , a leatherworker who has a house beside the sea . ''"
10572,The angel who spoke to Cornelius left .
10573,Then Cornelius called two of his servants and a soldier .
10574,"The soldier was a religious man , one of his close helpers ."
10575,Cornelius explained everything to these three men and sent them to Joppa .
10576,"The next day they were coming near Joppa about noon , when Peter was going up to the roof to pray ."
10577,He was hungry and wanted to eat .
10578,"But while they were preparing the food for Peter to eat , he had a vision ."
10579,He saw something coming down through the open sky .
10580,It looked like a big sheet being lowered to the ground by its four corners .
10581,"In it were all kinds of animals , reptiles , and birds ."
10582,"Then a voice said to him , `` Get up , Peter ; kill anything here and eat it . ''"
10583,"But Peter said , `` I ca n't do that , Lord !"
10584,I have never eaten anything that is not pure or fit to be used for food . ''
10585,"But the voice said to him again , `` God has made these things pure ."
10586,Do n't say they are unfit to eat . ''
10587,This happened three times .
10588,Then the whole thing was taken back up into heaven .
10589,Peter wondered what this vision meant .
10590,The men Cornelius sent had found Simon 's house .
10591,They were standing at the door .
10592,"They asked , `` Is Simon Peter staying here ? ''"
10593,"While Peter was still thinking about the vision , the Spirit said to him , `` Listen , three men are looking for you ."
10594,Get up and go downstairs .
10595,"Go with these men without wondering if it 's all right , because I sent them . ''"
10596,"So Peter went downstairs and said to them , `` I think I 'm the man you are looking for ."
10597,Why did you come here ? ''
10598,"The men said , `` A holy angel told Cornelius to invite you to his house ."
10599,He is an army officer .
10600,"He is a good man , one who worships God , and all the Jewish people respect him ."
10601,The angel told him to invite you to his house so that he can listen to what you have to say . ''
10602,Peter asked the men to come in and stay for the night .
10603,The next day Peter got ready and went away with the three men .
10604,Some of the believers from Joppa went with him .
10605,The next day they came to the city of Caesarea .
10606,Cornelius was waiting for them and had already gathered his relatives and close friends at his house .
10607,"When Peter entered the house , Cornelius met him ."
10608,He fell down at Peter 's feet and worshiped him .
10609,But Peter told him to get up .
10610,"Peter said , `` Stand up !"
10611,I am only a man like you . ''
10612,Peter continued talking with Cornelius .
10613,Then Peter went inside and saw a large group of people gathered there .
10614,"Peter said to the people , `` You understand that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit anyone who is not a Jew ."
10615,But God has shown me that I should not consider anyone unfit or say they are not pure .
10616,That 's why I did n't argue when your men asked me to come here .
10617,"Now , please tell me why you sent for me . ''"
10618,"Cornelius said , `` Four days ago , I was praying in my house ."
10619,It was at this same time -- three o'clock in the afternoon .
10620,"Suddenly there was someone standing before me wearing bright , shiny clothes ."
10621,"He said , ' Cornelius , God has heard your prayer and has seen your gifts to the poor ."
10622,He remembers you and all you have done .
10623,So send some men to the city of Joppa and tell Simon Peter to come .
10624,"He is staying with another man named Simon , a leatherworker who has a house beside the sea . '"
10625,So I sent for you immediately .
10626,It was very good of you to come here .
10627,Now we are all here before God to hear everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us . ''
10628,Peter began to speak : `` I really understand now that God does not consider some people to be better than others .
10629,He accepts anyone who worships him and does what is right .
10630,It is not important what nation they come from .
10631,God has spoken to the people of Israel .
10632,"He sent them the Good News that peace has come through Jesus Christ , the Lord of all people ."
10633,`` You know what has happened all over Judea .
10634,It began in Galilee after John told the people they needed to be baptized .
10635,You know about Jesus from Nazareth .
10636,God made him the Christ by giving him the Holy Spirit and power .
10637,Jesus went everywhere doing good for people .
10638,"He healed those who were ruled by the devil , showing that God was with him ."
10639,`` We saw all that Jesus did in Judea and in Jerusalem .
10640,But he was killed .
10641,They put him on a cross made of wood .
10642,"But on the third day after his death , God raised him to life and let him be seen openly ."
10643,"He was not seen by everyone , but only by us , the ones God had already chosen to be witnesses ."
10644,We ate and drank with him after he was raised from death .
10645,`` Jesus told us to go and speak to the people .
10646,He told us to tell them that he is the one God chose to be the Judge of all who are living and all who have died .
10647,Everyone who believes in Jesus will have their sins forgiven through his name .
10648,All the prophets agree that this is true . ''
10649,"While Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit came down on all those who were listening to his speech ."
10650,The Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed that the Holy Spirit had been poured out as a gift also to people who were not Jews .
10651,They heard them speaking different languages and praising God .
10652,"Then Peter said , `` How can anyone object to these people being baptized in water ?"
10653,They have received the Holy Spirit the same as we did ! ''
10654,So Peter told them to baptize Cornelius and his relatives and friends in the name of Jesus Christ .
10655,Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days .
10656,"When the trouble stopped , Paul invited the Lord 's followers to come visit him ."
10657,"After encouraging them , he told them goodbye and left for Macedonia ."
10658,On his way through Macedonia he had many words of encouragement for the followers in various places .
10659,Then he went to Greece and stayed there three months .
10660,"Paul was ready to sail for Syria , but some Jews were planning something against him ."
10661,So he decided to go back through Macedonia to Syria .
10662,"These men were traveling with him : Sopater , the son of Pyrrhus , from the city of Berea ; Aristarchus and Secundus , from the city of Thessalonica ; Gaius , from the city of Derbe ; Timothy ; and two men from Asia , Tychicus and Trophimus ."
10663,"These men went first , ahead of Paul ."
10664,They waited for us in the city of Troas .
10665,We sailed from the city of Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread .
10666,We met these men in Troas five days later and stayed there seven days .
10667,On Sunday we all met together to eat the Lord 's Supper .
10668,Paul talked to the group .
10669,"Because he was planning to leave the next day , he continued talking until midnight ."
10670,"We were all together in a room upstairs , and there were many lights in the room ."
10671,There was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window .
10672,"Paul continued talking , and Eutychus became very , very sleepy ."
10673,"Finally , he went to sleep and fell out of the window ."
10674,He fell to the ground from the third floor .
10675,"When the people went down and lifted him up , he was dead ."
10676,"Paul went down to where Eutychus was , knelt down beside him , and put his arms around him ."
10677,"He said to the other believers , `` Do n't worry ."
10678,He is alive now . ''
10679,"Then Paul went upstairs again , broke off some pieces of bread and ate ."
10680,He spoke to them a long time .
10681,"It was early morning when he finished , and then he left ."
10682,"The Lord 's followers took Eutychus home alive , and they were all greatly comforted ."
10683,"We went on ahead of Paul and sailed for the city of Assos , planning to meet him there ."
10684,This is what he told us to do because he wanted to go by land .
10685,"When he caught up with us at Assos , we took him on board , and we all sailed to Mitylene ."
10686,"The next day , we sailed away from there and came to a place near the island of Chios ."
10687,"Then the next day , we sailed to the island of Samos ."
10688,"A day later , we came to the city of Miletus ."
10689,Paul had already decided not to stop at Ephesus .
10690,He did not want to stay too long in Asia .
10691,He was hurrying because he wanted to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost if possible .
10692,"In Miletus Paul sent a message back to Ephesus , telling the elders of the church in Ephesus to come to him ."
10693,"When they came , Paul said to them , `` You know about my life from the first day I came to Asia ."
10694,You know the way I lived all the time I was with you .
10695,"The Jews planned things against me , and this gave me much trouble ."
10696,"But you know that I always served the Lord , sometimes with tears ."
10697,I never thought about myself first .
10698,I always did what was best for you .
10699,I told you the Good News about Jesus in public before the people and also taught in your homes .
10700,I told everyone -- Jewish and non-Jewish people -- to change and turn to God .
10701,I told them all to believe in our Lord Jesus .
10702,`` But now I must obey the Spirit and go to Jerusalem .
10703,I do n't know what will happen to me there .
10704,I know only that in every city the Holy Spirit tells me that troubles and even jail wait for me .
10705,I do n't care about my own life .
10706,The most important thing is that I finish my work .
10707,I want to finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do -- to tell people the Good News about God 's grace .
10708,`` And now listen to me .
10709,I know that none of you will ever see me again .
10710,"All the time I was with you , I told you the Good News about God 's kingdom ."
10711,So today I can tell you one thing that I am sure of : God will not blame me if some of you are not saved .
10712,I can say this because I know that I told you everything that God wants you to know .
10713,Be careful for yourselves and for all the people God has given you .
10714,The Holy Spirit gave you the work of caring for this flock .
10715,You must be like shepherds to the church of God .
10716,This is the church that God bought with his own blood .
10717,"I know that after I leave , some men will come into your group ."
10718,They will be like wild wolves and will try to destroy the flock .
10719,"Also , men from your own group will begin to teach things that are wrong ."
10720,They will lead some of the Lord 's followers away from the truth to follow them .
10721,So be careful !
10722,And always remember what I did during the three years I was with you .
10723,"I never stopped reminding each one of you how you should live , counseling you day and night and crying over you ."
10724,`` Now I am putting you in God 's care .
10725,I am depending on the message about his grace to make you strong .
10726,That message is able to give you the blessings that God gives to all his holy people .
10727,"When I was with you , I never wanted anyone 's money or fine clothes ."
10728,You know that I always worked to take care of my own needs and the needs of the people who were with me .
10729,I always showed you that you should work just as I did and help people who are weak .
10730,I taught you to remember the words of the Lord Jesus : ' You will have a greater blessing when you give than when you receive . ' ''
10731,"When Paul finished speaking , he knelt down , and they all prayed together ."
10732,They cried and cried .
10733,They were especially sad because Paul had said they would never see him again .
10734,They hugged him and kissed him .
10735,Then they went with him to the ship to say goodbye .
10736,"Brothers and sisters , what I want most is for all the people of Israel to be saved ."
10737,That is my prayer to God .
10738,"I can say this about them : They really try hard to follow God , but they do n't know the right way ."
10739,They did not know the way that God makes people right with him .
10740,And they tried to make themselves right in their own way .
10741,So they did not accept God 's way of making people right .
10742,Christ ended the law so that everyone who believes in him is made right with God .
10743,Moses writes about being made right by following the law .
10744,"He says , `` The person who obeys these laws is the one who will have life through them . ''"
10745,"But this is what the Scriptures say about being made right through faith : `` Do n't say to yourself , ' Who will go up into heaven ? ' ''"
10746,-LRB- This means `` Who will go up to heaven to get Christ and bring him down to earth ? ''
10747,"-RRB- `` And do n't say , ' Who will go down into the world below ? ' ''"
10748,-LRB- This means `` Who will go down to get Christ and bring him up from death ? ''
10749,-RRB- This is what the Scripture says : `` God 's teaching is near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart . ''
10750,It is the teaching of faith that we tell people .
10751,"If you openly say , `` Jesus is Lord '' and believe in your heart that God raised him from death , you will be saved ."
10752,"Yes , we believe in Jesus deep in our hearts , and so we are made right with God ."
10753,"And we openly say that we believe in him , and so we are saved ."
10754,"Yes , the Scriptures say , `` Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed . ''"
10755,It says this because there is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not .
10756,The same Lord is the Lord of all people .
10757,And he richly blesses everyone who looks to him for help .
10758,"Yes , `` everyone who trusts in the Lord will be saved . ''"
10759,"But before people can pray to the Lord for help , they must believe in him ."
10760,"And before they can believe in the Lord , they must hear about him ."
10761,"And for anyone to hear about the Lord , someone must tell them ."
10762,"And before anyone can go and tell them , they must be sent ."
10763,"As the Scriptures say , `` How wonderful it is to see someone coming to tell good news ! ''"
10764,But not all the people accepted that good news .
10765,"Isaiah said , `` Lord , who believed what we told them ? ''"
10766,So faith comes from hearing the Good News .
10767,And people hear the Good News when someone tells them about Christ .
10768,"But I ask , `` Did those people not hear the Good News ? ''"
10769,"Yes , they heard -- as the Scriptures say , `` Their voices went out all around the world ."
10770,Their words went everywhere in the world . ''
10771,"Again I ask , `` Did the people of Israel not understand ? ''"
10772,"Yes , they did understand ."
10773,"First , Moses says this for God : `` I will use those who are not really a nation to make you jealous ."
10774,I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry . ''
10775,Then Isaiah is bold enough to say this for God : `` The people who were not looking for me -- they are the ones who found me .
10776,I made myself known to those who did not ask for me . ''
10777,"But about the people of Israel God says , `` All day long I stood ready to accept those people , but they are stubborn and refuse to obey me . ''"
10778,"Brothers and sisters , I want you to know what happened to our ancestors who were with Moses ."
10779,"They were all under the cloud , and they all walked through the sea ."
10780,They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
10781,"They all ate the same spiritual food , and they all drank the same spiritual drink ."
10782,"They drank from that spiritual rock that was with them , and that rock was Christ ."
10783,"But God was not pleased with most of those people , so they were killed in the desert ."
10784,And these things that happened are examples for us .
10785,These examples should stop us from wanting evil things like those people did .
10786,Do n't worship idols as some of them did .
10787,"As the Scriptures say , `` The people sat down to eat and drink and then got up to have a wild party . ''"
10788,We should not commit sexual sins as some of them did .
10789,"In one day 23 , 000 of them died because of their sin ."
10790,We should not test Christ as some of them did .
10791,"Because of that , they were killed by snakes ."
10792,And do n't complain as some of them did .
10793,"Because they complained , they were killed by the angel that destroys ."
10794,The things that happened to those people are examples .
10795,They were written to be warnings for us .
10796,We live in the time that all those past histories were pointing to .
10797,So anyone who thinks they are standing strong should be careful that they do n't fall .
10798,The only temptations that you have are the same temptations that all people have .
10799,But you can trust God .
10800,He will not let you be tempted more than you can bear .
10801,"But when you are tempted , God will also give you a way to escape that temptation ."
10802,Then you will be able to endure it .
10803,"So , my dear friends , stay away from worshiping idols ."
10804,You are intelligent people .
10805,Judge for yourselves the truth of what I say now .
10806,"The cup of blessing that we give thanks for is a sharing in the blood sacrifice of Christ , is n't it ?"
10807,"And the bread that we break is a sharing in the body of Christ , is n't it ?"
10808,"There is one loaf of bread , so we who are many are one body , because we all share in that one loaf ."
10809,And think about what the people of Israel do .
10810,"When they eat the sacrifices , they are united by sharing what was offered on the altar ."
10811,"So , am I saying that sacrifices to idols are the same as those Jewish sacrifices ?"
10812,"No , because an idol is nothing , and the things offered to idols are worth nothing ."
10813,"But I am saying that when food is sacrificed to idols , it is an offering to demons , not to God ."
10814,And I do n't want you to share anything with demons .
10815,You can not drink the cup of the Lord and then go drink a cup that honors demons .
10816,You can not share a meal at the Lord 's table and then go share a meal that honors demons .
10817,Doing that would make the Lord jealous .
10818,Do you really want to do that ?
10819,Do you think we are stronger than he is ?
10820,"`` All things are allowed , '' you say ."
10821,But not all things are good .
10822,`` All things are allowed . ''
10823,But some things do n't help anyone .
10824,"Try to do what is good for others , not just what is good for yourselves ."
10825,Eat any meat that is sold in the meat market .
10826,Do n't ask questions about it to see if it is something you think is wrong to eat .
10827,"You can eat it , `` because the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord . ''"
10828,Someone who is not a believer might invite you to eat with them .
10829,"If you want to go , then eat anything that is put before you ."
10830,Do n't ask questions to see if it is something you think is wrong to eat .
10831,"But if someone tells you , `` That food was offered to idols , '' then do n't eat it ."
10832,"That 's because some people think it is wrong , and it might cause a problem for the person who told you that ."
10833,I do n't mean that you think it is wrong .
10834,But the other person might think it is wrong .
10835,That 's the only reason not to eat it .
10836,My own freedom should not be judged by what another person thinks .
10837,I eat the meal with thankfulness .
10838,So I do n't want to be criticized because of something I thank God for .
10839,"So if you eat , or if you drink , or if you do anything , do it for the glory of God ."
10840,"Never do anything that might make other people do wrong -- Jews , non-Jews , or anyone in God 's church ."
10841,I do the same thing .
10842,I try to please everyone in every way .
10843,I am not trying to do what is good for me .
10844,I am trying to do what is good for the most people so that they can be saved .
10845,"I , Paul , am begging you with the gentleness and the kindness of Christ ."
10846,"Some say that I am bold when I am writing you from a distance , but not when I am there with you ."
10847,They think our motives for what we do are like those of the world .
10848,I plan to be very bold against those people when I come .
10849,I hope I will not need to use that same boldness with you .
10850,"We live in this world , but we do n't fight our battles in the same way the world does ."
10851,The weapons we use are not human ones .
10852,Our weapons have power from God and can destroy the enemy 's strong places .
10853,"We destroy people 's arguments , and we tear down every proud idea that raises itself against the knowledge of God ."
10854,We also capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ .
10855,"We are ready to punish anyone there who does not obey , but first we want you to be fully obedient ."
10856,You must look at the facts before you .
10857,"If you feel sure you belong to Christ , you must remember that we belong to Christ the same as you do ."
10858,It may seem as though we boast too much about the authority the Lord gave us .
10859,"But he gave us this authority to strengthen you , not to hurt you ."
10860,So I will not be ashamed of whatever boasting we do .
10861,I do n't want you to think that I am trying to scare you with my letters .
10862,"Some people say , `` Paul 's letters are powerful and sound important , but when he is with us , he is weak and the worst speaker you have ever heard . ''"
10863,"Those people should know this : When we are there with you , we will show the same power that we show now in our letters ."
10864,We do n't dare put ourselves in the same class with those who think they are so important .
10865,We do n't compare ourselves to them .
10866,"They use themselves to measure themselves , and they judge themselves by what they themselves are ."
10867,This shows that they know nothing .
10868,But we will not boast about anything outside the work that was given us to do .
10869,"We will limit our boasting to the work God gave us , but this work includes our work with you ."
10870,We would be boasting too much only if we had not already come to you .
10871,But we have come to you with the Good News of Christ .
10872,We limit our boasting to the work that is ours .
10873,We do n't boast about the work other people have done .
10874,We hope that your faith will continue to grow .
10875,We hope that you will help our work to grow much larger .
10876,We want to tell the Good News in the areas beyond your city .
10877,We do n't want to boast about work that has already been done in someone else 's area .
10878,`` Whoever boasts should boast only about the Lord . ''
10879,What people say about themselves means nothing .
10880,What counts is whether or not the Lord says they have done well .
10881,The law gave us only an unclear picture of the good things coming in the future .
10882,The law is not a perfect picture of the real things .
10883,The law tells people to offer the same sacrifices every year .
10884,Those who come to worship God continue to offer those sacrifices .
10885,But the law can never make them perfect .
10886,"If the law could make people perfect , those sacrifices would have already stopped ."
10887,"They would already be clean from their sins , and they would not still feel guilty ."
10888,But that 's not what happens .
10889,"Their sacrifices make them remember their sins every year , because it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins ."
10890,"So when Christ came into the world he said , `` You do n't want sacrifices and offerings , but you have prepared a body for me ."
10891,You are not pleased with the sacrifices of animals killed and burned or with offerings to take away sins .
10892,"Then I said , ' Here I am , God ."
10893,It is written about me in the book of the law .
10894,I have come to do what you want . ' ''
10895,"Christ first said , `` You do n't want sacrifices and offerings ."
10896,You are not pleased with animals killed and burned or with sacrifices to take away sin . ''
10897,-LRB- These are all sacrifices that the law commands . -RRB-
10898,"Then he said , `` Here I am , God ."
10899,I have come to do what you want . ''
10900,So God ends that first system of sacrifices and starts his new way .
10901,Jesus Christ did the things God wanted him to do .
10902,"And because of that , we are made holy through the sacrifice of Christ 's body ."
10903,Christ made that sacrifice one time -- enough for all time .
10904,Every day the priests stand and do their religious service .
10905,"Again and again they offer the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins ."
10906,"But Christ offered only one sacrifice for sins , and that sacrifice is good for all time ."
10907,Then he sat down at the right side of God .
10908,And now Christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power .
10909,With one sacrifice Christ made his people perfect forever .
10910,They are the ones who are being made holy .
10911,The Holy Spirit also tells us about this .
10912,"First he says , `` This is the agreement I will make with my people in the future , says the Lord ."
10913,I will put my laws in their hearts .
10914,I will write my laws in their minds . ''
10915,"Then he says , `` I will forget their sins and never again remember the evil they have done . ''"
10916,"And after everything is forgiven , there is no more need for a sacrifice to pay for sins ."
10917,"And so , brothers and sisters , we are completely free to enter the Most Holy Place ."
10918,We can do this without fear because of the blood sacrifice of Jesus .
10919,We enter through a new way that Jesus opened for us .
10920,It is a living way that leads through the curtain -- Christ 's body .
10921,And we have a great priest who rules the house of God .
10922,"Sprinkled with the blood of Christ , our hearts have been made free from a guilty conscience , and our bodies have been washed with pure water ."
10923,"So come near to God with a sincere heart , full of confidence because of our faith in Christ ."
10924,"We must hold on to the hope we have , never hesitating to tell people about it ."
10925,We can trust God to do what he promised .
10926,We should think about each other to see how we can encourage each other to show love and do good works .
10927,"We must not quit meeting together , as some are doing ."
10928,"No , we need to keep on encouraging each other ."
10929,This becomes more and more important as you see the Day getting closer .
10930,"If we decide to continue sinning after we have learned the truth , then there is no other sacrifice that will take away sins ."
10931,"If we continue sinning , all that is left for us is a fearful time of waiting for the judgment and the angry fire that will destroy those who live against God ."
10932,Whoever refused to obey the Law of Moses was found guilty from the testimony given by two or three witnesses .
10933,Such people were not forgiven .
10934,They were killed .
10935,So think how much more punishment people deserve who show their hate for the Son of God -- people who show they have no respect for the blood sacrifice that began the new agreement and once made them holy or who insult the Spirit of God 's grace .
10936,"We know that God said , `` I will punish people for the wrongs they do ; I will repay them . ''"
10937,"And he also said , `` The Lord will judge his people . ''"
10938,It is a terrible thing to face punishment from the living God .
10939,Remember the days when you first learned the truth .
10940,"You had a hard struggle with much suffering , but you continued strong ."
10941,Sometimes people said hateful things to you and mistreated you in public .
10942,And sometimes you helped others who were being treated that same way .
10943,"Yes , you helped them in prison and shared in their suffering ."
10944,And you were still happy when everything you owned was taken away from you .
10945,"You continued to be happy , because you knew that you had something much better -- something that would continue forever ."
10946,So do n't lose the courage that you had in the past .
10947,Your courage will be rewarded richly .
10948,You must be patient .
10949,"After you have done what God wants , you will get what he promised you ."
10950,"He says , `` Very soon now , the one who is coming will come and will not be late ."
10951,The person who is right with me will live by trusting in me .
10952,But I will not be pleased with the one who turns back in fear . ''
10953,But we are not those who turn back and are lost .
10954,"No , we are the people who have faith and are saved ."
10955,Then I saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven .
10956,The angel was dressed in a cloud .
10957,He had a rainbow around his head .
10958,"The angel 's face was like the sun , and his legs were like poles of fire ."
10959,The angel was holding a small scroll .
10960,The scroll was open in his hand .
10961,He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
10962,He shouted loudly like the roaring of a lion .
10963,"After he shouted , the voices of seven thunders spoke ."
10964,"The seven thunders spoke , and I started to write ."
10965,"But then I heard a voice from heaven that said , `` Do n't write what the seven thunders said ."
10966,Keep those things secret . ''
10967,Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven .
10968,The angel made a promise by the power of the one who lives forever and ever .
10969,He is the one who made the skies and all that is in them .
10970,"He made the earth and all that is in it , and he made the sea and all that is in it ."
10971,"The angel said , `` There will be no more waiting !"
10972,"In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet , God 's secret plan will be completed -- the Good News that God told to his servants , the prophets . ''"
10973,Then I heard the same voice from heaven again .
10974,"It said to me , `` Go and take the open scroll that is in the angel 's hand ."
10975,This is the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land . ''
10976,So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll .
10977,"He said to me , `` Take the scroll and eat it ."
10978,"It will be sour in your stomach , but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey . ''"
10979,So I took the little scroll from the angel 's hand and ate it .
10980,"In my mouth it tasted sweet like honey , but after I ate it , it was sour in my stomach ."
10981,"Then I was told , `` You must prophesy again about many races of people , many nations , languages , and rulers . ''"
10982,I saw an angel coming down out of heaven .
10983,The angel had the key to the bottomless pit .
10984,The angel also held a large chain in his hand .
10985,"The angel grabbed the dragon , that old snake , also known as the devil or Satan ."
10986,The angel tied the dragon with the chain for 1000 years .
10987,Then the angel threw the dragon into the bottomless pit and closed it .
10988,The angel locked it over the dragon .
10989,The angel did this so that the dragon could not trick the people of the earth until the 1000 years were ended .
10990,After 1000 years the dragon must be made free for a short time .
10991,Then I saw some thrones and people sitting on them .
10992,These were the ones who had been given the power to judge .
10993,And I saw the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the truth of Jesus and the message from God .
10994,They did not worship the beast or its idol .
10995,They did not receive the mark of the beast on their foreheads or on their hands .
10996,They came back to life and ruled with Christ for 1000 years .
10997,-LRB- The rest of the dead did not live again until the 1000 years were ended . -RRB-
10998,This is the first resurrection .
10999,Great blessings belong to those who share in this first resurrection .
11000,They are God 's holy people .
11001,The second death has no power over them .
11002,They will be priests for God and for Christ .
11003,They will rule with him for 1000 years .
11004,"When the 1000 years are ended , Satan will be made free from his prison ."
11005,"He will go out to trick the nations in all the earth , the nations known as Gog and Magog ."
11006,Satan will gather the people for battle .
11007,"There will be more people than anyone can count , like sand on the seashore ."
11008,I saw Satan 's army march across the earth and gather around the camp of God 's people and the city that God loves .
11009,But fire came down from heaven and destroyed Satan 's army .
11010,And he -LRB- the one who tricked these people -RRB- was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur with the beast and the false prophet .
11011,There they would be tortured day and night forever and ever .
11012,Then I saw a large white throne .
11013,I saw the one who was sitting on the throne .
11014,Earth and sky ran away from him and disappeared .
11015,"And I saw those who had died , great and small , standing before the throne ."
11016,Some books were opened .
11017,And another book was opened -- the book of life .
11018,"The people were judged by what they had done , which is written in the books ."
11019,The sea gave up the dead who were in it .
11020,Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them .
11021,All these people were judged by what they had done .
11022,And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire .
11023,This lake of fire is the second death .
11024,And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire .
11025,Samuel took a jar of the special oil and poured the oil on Saul 's head .
11026,"Samuel kissed Saul and said , `` The Lord has anointed you to be the leader over the people who belong to him ."
11027,You will control the people .
11028,You will save them from the enemies that are all around them .
11029,He has anointed you to be ruler over his people .
11030,"Here is a sign that will prove this is true : After you leave me today , you will meet two men near Rachel 's tomb on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah ."
11031,"The two men will say to you , ' Someone found the donkeys you were looking for ."
11032,Your father stopped worrying about his donkeys .
11033,Now he is worrying about you .
11034,He is saying : What will I do about my son ? ' ''
11035,"Samuel said , `` Then you will go until you come to the large oak tree at Tabor ."
11036,Three men will meet you there .
11037,They will be on their way to worship God at Bethel .
11038,One man will be carrying three young goats .
11039,The second man will be carrying three loaves of bread .
11040,And the third man will have a leather bag full of wine .
11041,These three men will say hello to you .
11042,"They will offer you two loaves of bread , and you will accept the two loaves ."
11043,Then you will go to Gibeath Elohim .
11044,There is a Philistine fort in that place .
11045,"When you come to this town , a group of prophets will come out ."
11046,These prophets will come down from the place for worship .
11047,They will be prophesying .
11048,"They will be playing harps , tambourines , flutes , and lyres ."
11049,Then the Lord 's Spirit will come on you with great power .
11050,You will be changed .
11051,You will be like a different man .
11052,You will begin to prophesy with these prophets .
11053,"After that happens , you can do whatever you choose to do , because God will be with you ."
11054,`` Go to Gilgal before me .
11055,Then I will come there to you .
11056,And I will offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings .
11057,But you must wait seven days .
11058,Then I will come and tell you what to do . ''
11059,"Just as Saul turned to leave Samuel , God turned Saul 's life around ."
11060,All these things happened that day .
11061,"When Saul and his servant came to Gibeath Elohim , Saul met a group of prophets ."
11062,"God 's Spirit came on Saul with great power , and Saul prophesied with the prophets ."
11063,Some of the people who had known Saul before saw him prophesying with the prophets .
11064,"So they asked each other , `` What has happened to Kish 's son ?"
11065,Is Saul also one the prophets ? ''
11066,"A man living in Gibeath Elohim said , `` Yes , and it seems that he is their leader . ''"
11067,That is why this became a famous saying : `` Is Saul also one of the prophets ? ''
11068,"After Saul finished prophesying , he went to the place of worship ."
11069,"Saul 's uncle asked Saul and his servant , `` Where have you been ? ''"
11070,"Saul said , `` We were looking for the donkeys ."
11071,"When we could n't find them , we went to see Samuel . ''"
11072,"Saul 's uncle said , `` Please tell me , what did Samuel say to you ? ''"
11073,"Saul answered , `` Samuel told us the donkeys were already found . ''"
11074,He did not tell his uncle everything .
11075,Saul did not tell him what Samuel said about the kingdom .
11076,Samuel told all the Israelites to meet together with the Lord at Mizpah .
11077,"Samuel told the Israelites , `` The Lord , the God of Israel says , ' I led Israel out of Egypt ."
11078,I saved you from Egypt 's control and from the other kingdoms that tried to hurt you . '
11079,But today you have rejected your God .
11080,Your God saves you from all your troubles and problems .
11081,"But you said , ' No , we want a king to rule us . '"
11082,"Now come , stand before the Lord in your family groups and tribes . ''"
11083,Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near .
11084,Then Samuel began to choose the new king .
11085,"First , the tribe of Benjamin was chosen ."
11086,Samuel told each family in the tribe of Benjamin to pass by .
11087,Matri 's family was chosen .
11088,Then Samuel told each man in Matri 's family to walk by .
11089,Saul son of Kish was chosen .
11090,"But when the people looked for Saul , they could not find him ."
11091,"Then they asked the Lord , `` Has Saul come here yet ? ''"
11092,"The Lord said , `` Saul is hiding behind the supplies . ''"
11093,The people ran and took Saul out from behind the supplies .
11094,Saul stood up among the people .
11095,He was a head taller than anyone else .
11096,"Samuel said to all the people , `` See the man the Lord has chosen ."
11097,There is no one like Saul among the people . ''
11098,"Then the people shouted , `` Long live the king ! ''"
11099,Samuel explained the rules of the kingdom to the people .
11100,He wrote the rules in a book and put the book before the Lord .
11101,Then Samuel told the people to go home .
11102,Saul also went to his home in Gibeah .
11103,God touched the hearts of brave men who then began to follow Saul .
11104,"But some troublemakers said , `` How can this man save us ? ''"
11105,They said bad things about Saul and refused to bring gifts to him .
11106,But Saul said nothing .
11107,King Nahash of the Ammonites had been hurting the tribes of Gad and Reuben .
11108,Nahash poked out the right eye of each of the men and did not allow anyone to help them .
11109,He poked out the right eye of every Israelite man living in the area east of the Jordan River .
11110,But 7000 Israelite men ran away from the Ammonites and came to Jabesh Gilead .
11111,"David ran away from the camps at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked him , `` What have I done wrong ?"
11112,What is my crime ?
11113,Why is your father trying to kill me ? ''
11114,"Jonathan answered , `` That ca n't be true !"
11115,My father is n't trying to kill you .
11116,My father does n't do anything without first telling me .
11117,"It does n't matter how important it is , my father always tells me ."
11118,Why would my father refuse to tell me that he wants to kill you ?
11119,"No , it is not true ! ''"
11120,"But David answered , `` Your father knows very well that I am your friend ."
11121,"Your father said to himself , ' Jonathan must not know about it ."
11122,"If he knows , he will tell David . '"
11123,"But as surely as you and the Lord are alive , I am very close to death . ''"
11124,"Jonathan said to David , `` I will do anything you want me to do . ''"
11125,"Then David said , `` Look , tomorrow is the New Moon celebration ."
11126,"I am supposed to eat with the king , but let me hide in the field until the evening ."
11127,"If your father notices I am gone , tell him , ' David wanted to go home to Bethlehem ."
11128,His family is having its own feast for this monthly sacrifice .
11129,David asked me to let him run down to Bethlehem and join his family . '
11130,"If your father says , ' Fine , ' then I am safe ."
11131,"But if your father becomes angry , you will know that he wants to hurt me ."
11132,"Jonathan , be kind to me ."
11133,I am your servant .
11134,You have made an agreement with me before the Lord .
11135,"If I am guilty , you may kill me yourself , but do n't take me to your father . ''"
11136,"Jonathan answered , `` No , never !"
11137,"If I learn that my father plans to hurt you , I will warn you . ''"
11138,"David said , `` Who will warn me if your father says bad things to you ? ''"
11139,"Then Jonathan said , `` Come , let 's go out into the field . ''"
11140,So Jonathan and David went together into the field .
11141,"Jonathan said to David , `` I make this promise before the Lord , the God of Israel ."
11142,I promise that I will learn how my father feels about you .
11143,I will learn if he feels good about you or not .
11144,"Then , in three days , I will send a message to you in the field ."
11145,"If my father wants to hurt you , I will let you know ."
11146,I will let you leave in safety .
11147,May the Lord punish me if I do n't do this .
11148,May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father .
11149,"As long as I live , show me the same kindness the Lord does ."
11150,"And if I die , never stop showing this kindness to my family ."
11151,"Be faithful to us , even when the Lord destroys all your enemies from the earth . ''"
11152,"So Jonathan made this agreement with David and his family , and he asked the Lord to hold them responsible for keeping it ."
11153,"Jonathan loved David as himself , and because of this love , he asked David to repeat this agreement for himself ."
11154,"Jonathan said to David , `` Tomorrow is the New Moon celebration ."
11155,"Your seat will be empty , so my father will see that you are gone ."
11156,On the third day go to the same place you hid when this trouble began .
11157,Wait by that hill .
11158,On the third day I will go to that hill and shoot three arrows as if I am shooting at a target .
11159,Then I will tell the boy to go find the arrows .
11160,"If everything is fine , I will tell the boy , ' You went too far !"
11161,The arrows are closer to me .
11162,Come back and get them . '
11163,"If I say that , you can come out of hiding ."
11164,"I promise , as surely as the Lord lives , you are safe ."
11165,There is no danger .
11166,"But if there is trouble , I will say to the boy , ' The arrows are farther away ."
11167,Go get them . '
11168,"If I say that , you must leave ."
11169,The Lord is sending you away .
11170,Remember this agreement between you and me .
11171,The Lord is our witness forever . ''
11172,Then David hid in the field .
11173,"The time for the New Moon celebration came , and the king sat down to eat ."
11174,"He sat next to the wall where he usually sat , and Jonathan sat across from him ."
11175,"Abner sat next to Saul , but David 's place was empty ."
11176,That day Saul said nothing .
11177,"He thought , `` Maybe something happened to David so that he is not clean . ''"
11178,"On the next day , the second day of the month , David 's place was empty again ."
11179,"Then Saul said to his son Jonathan , `` Why did n't Jesse 's son come to the New Moon celebration yesterday or today ? ''"
11180,"Jonathan answered , `` David asked me to let him go to Bethlehem ."
11181,"He said , ' Let me go ."
11182,Our family is having a sacrifice in Bethlehem .
11183,My brother ordered me to be there .
11184,"Now if I am your friend , please let me go and see my brothers . '"
11185,That is why David has not come to the king 's table . ''
11186,"Saul was very angry with Jonathan and said to him , `` You son of a twisted , rebellious woman !"
11187,I know that you have chosen to support that son of Jesse -- it will bring shame to you and to your mother .
11188,"As long as Jesse 's son lives , you will never be king and have a kingdom ."
11189,"Now , bring David to me !"
11190,He is a dead man . ''
11191,"Jonathan asked his father , `` Why should David be killed ?"
11192,What did he do wrong ? ''
11193,But Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and tried to kill him .
11194,So Jonathan knew that his father wanted very much to kill David .
11195,Jonathan became angry and left the table .
11196,He was so upset and angry with his father that he refused to eat any food on the second day of the festival .
11197,He was angry because Saul humiliated him and because Saul wanted to kill David .
11198,The next morning Jonathan went out to the field to meet David as they had agreed .
11199,Jonathan brought a little boy with him .
11200,"He said to the boy , `` Run ."
11201,Go find the arrows I shoot . ''
11202,"The boy began to run , and Jonathan shot the arrows over his head ."
11203,"The boy ran to the place where the arrows fell , but Jonathan called , `` The arrows are farther away . ''"
11204,"Then he shouted , `` Hurry !"
11205,Go get them .
11206,Do n't just stand there . ''
11207,The boy picked up the arrows and brought them back to his master .
11208,The boy knew nothing about what went on .
11209,Only Jonathan and David knew .
11210,Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him to go back to town .
11211,"When the boy left , David came out from his hiding place on the other side of the hill ."
11212,David gave a formal greeting by bowing to the ground three times to show his respect for Jonathan .
11213,But then David and Jonathan kissed each other and cried together .
11214,"It was a very sad goodbye , especially for David ."
11215,"Then Jonathan said to David , `` Go in peace ."
11216,We have taken an oath in the Lord 's name to be friends forever .
11217,We have asked the Lord to be a witness between us and our descendants forever . ''
11218,"As soon as David and his men arrived at Ziklag on the third day , they saw that the Amalekites had attacked Ziklag ."
11219,"The Amalekites invaded the Negev area , attacked Ziklag , and burned the city ."
11220,"They took all the women in Ziklag , both young and old , as prisoners ."
11221,They did n't kill anyone ; they only took them as prisoners .
11222,"When David and his men came to Ziklag , they found the city burning ."
11223,"Their wives , sons , and daughters were all gone ."
11224,The Amalekites had taken them .
11225,David and the other men in his army cried loudly until they were too weak to cry anymore .
11226,"The Amalekites had taken David 's two wives , Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail , who had been the wife of Nabal from Carmel ."
11227,All the men in the army were sad and angry because their sons and daughters were taken as prisoners .
11228,The men were talking about killing David with stones .
11229,"This upset David very much , but he found strength in the Lord his God ."
11230,"David said to Abiathar the priest , `` Bring the ephod . ''"
11231,Then David prayed to the Lord .
11232,`` Should I chase the people who took our families ?
11233,Will I catch them ? ''
11234,"The Lord answered , `` Chase them ."
11235,"You will catch them , and you will save your families . ''"
11236,David took the 600 men with him and went to Besor Ravine .
11237,About 200 of his men stayed there because they were too weak and tired to continue .
11238,But David and the other 400 men continued to chase the Amalekites .
11239,David 's men found an Egyptian in a field and took him to David .
11240,They gave the Egyptian some water to drink and some food to eat .
11241,"The Egyptian had not had any food or water for three days and nights , so they gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins ."
11242,He felt better after eating .
11243,"David asked the Egyptian , `` Who is your master ?"
11244,Where do you come from ? ''
11245,"The Egyptian answered , `` I am an Egyptian , the slave of an Amalekite ."
11246,"Three days ago I got sick , and my master left me behind ."
11247,We had attacked the Negev area where the Kerethites live .
11248,We also attacked Judah and the Negev area where Caleb 's people live .
11249,We burned Ziklag . ''
11250,"David asked the Egyptian , `` Will you lead me to the people who took our families ? ''"
11251,"The Egyptian answered , `` If you make a special promise before God , I will help you find them ."
11252,But you must promise that you will not kill me or give me back to my master . ''
11253,The Egyptian led David to the Amalekites .
11254,"They were lying around on the ground , eating and drinking ."
11255,They were celebrating with the many things they had taken from the Philistines and from Judah .
11256,David attacked them and killed them .
11257,They fought from sunrise until the evening of the next day .
11258,"None of the Amalekites escaped , except for 400 young men who jumped onto their camels and rode away ."
11259,"David got back everything the Amalekites had taken , including his two wives ."
11260,Nothing was missing .
11261,"They found all the children and old people , all their sons and daughters , and all their valuables ."
11262,They got back everything the Amalekites had taken .
11263,David brought everything back .
11264,He took all the sheep and cattle .
11265,"His men led these animals to the front of the group and said , `` This is David 's prize . ''"
11266,David came to the 200 men who had stayed at Besor Ravine .
11267,These were the men who were too weak and tired to follow David .
11268,They came out to meet him and the soldiers who went with him .
11269,They greeted David and his army as they approached .
11270,"There were some troublemakers in the group who went with David who started complaining , `` These 200 men did n't go with us , so we why should we give them any of the things we took ."
11271,These men get nothing but their own wives and children . ''
11272,"David answered , `` No , my brothers ."
11273,Do n't do that !
11274,Think about what the Lord gave us .
11275,He let us defeat the enemy that attacked us .
11276,No one will listen to what you say .
11277,The share will be the same for the man who stayed with the supplies and for the man who went into battle .
11278,Everyone will share alike . ''
11279,David made this an order and rule for Israel .
11280,This rule continues even today .
11281,"When David got to Ziklag , he sent some of the things he took from the Amalekites to his friends , the leaders of Judah ."
11282,"David said , `` Here is a present for you that we took from the Lord 's enemies . ''"
11283,"David sent some of the gifts to the leaders in Bethel , Ramoth in the Negev , Jattir , Aroer , Siphmoth , Eshtemoa , Racal , the cities of the Jerahmeelites and the cities of the Kenites , Hormah , Bor Ashan , Athach , and Hebron , and to all the other places where David and his men had stayed ."
11284,Later King Nahash of the Ammonites died .
11285,His son Hanun became the new king after him .
11286,"David said , `` Nahash was kind to me , so I will be kind to his son Hanun . ''"
11287,So David sent his officers to comfort Hanun about his father 's death .
11288,David 's officers went to the land of the Ammonites .
11289,"But the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun , their lord , `` Do you think that David is trying to honor your father by sending some men to comfort you ?"
11290,"No , David sent these men to spy on your city ."
11291,They plan to make war against you . ''
11292,So Hanun took David 's officers and shaved off one half of their beards .
11293,He cut off their clothes at the hips .
11294,Then he sent them away .
11295,"When the people told David , he sent messengers to meet his officers ."
11296,He did this because these men were very ashamed .
11297,"King David said , `` Wait at Jericho until your beards grow again ."
11298,Then come back home . ''
11299,"The Ammonites saw that they had become David 's enemies , so they hired Arameans from Beth Rehob and Zobah ."
11300,"There were 20,000 Aramean foot soldiers ."
11301,"The Ammonites also hired the king of Maacah with 1000 men and 12,000 men from Tob ."
11302,"David heard about this , so he sent Joab and the whole army of powerful men ."
11303,The Ammonites came out and got ready for the battle .
11304,They stood at the city gate .
11305,The Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the men from Tob and Maacah did not stand together with the Ammonites in the field .
11306,Joab saw that there were enemies in front of him and behind him .
11307,So he chose some of the best Israelite soldiers and lined them up for battle against the Arameans .
11308,Then Joab gave the other men to his brother Abishai to lead against the Ammonites .
11309,"Joab said to Abishai , `` If the Arameans are too strong for me , you will help me ."
11310,"If the Ammonites are too strong for you , I will come and help you ."
11311,"Be strong , and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God ."
11312,The Lord will do what he decides is right . ''
11313,Then Joab and his men attacked the Arameans .
11314,The Arameans ran away from Joab and his men .
11315,"The Ammonites saw that the Arameans were running away , so they ran away from Abishai and went back to their city ."
11316,So Joab came back from the battle with the Ammonites and went back to Jerusalem .
11317,"When the Arameans saw that the Israelites had defeated them , they came together into one big army ."
11318,Hadadezer sent messengers to bring the Arameans who lived on the other side of the Euphrates River .
11319,These Arameans came to Helam .
11320,"Their leader was Shobach , the captain of Hadadezer 's army ."
11321,"When David heard about this , he gathered all the Israelites together ."
11322,They crossed over the Jordan River and went to Helam .
11323,"There the Arameans prepared for battle and attacked , but David defeated them , and they ran from the Israelites ."
11324,"David killed 700 chariot drivers and 40,000 horse soldiers as well as Shobach , the captain of the Aramean army ."
11325,"The kings who served Hadadezer saw that the Israelites had defeated them , so they made peace with the Israelites and became their servants ."
11326,The Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites again .
11327,At that place there was a man named Sheba son of Bicri .
11328,Sheba was a worthless troublemaker from the tribe of Benjamin .
11329,"He blew a trumpet to gather the people together and said , `` We have no share in David ."
11330,We have no part in the son of Jesse .
11331,"Israel , let 's all go home . ''"
11332,So all the Israelites left David and followed Sheba son of Bicri .
11333,But the people from Judah stayed with their king all the way from the Jordan River to Jerusalem .
11334,David went back to his house in Jerusalem .
11335,He had left ten of his slave women to take care of the house .
11336,He put these women in a special house .
11337,Then he put guards around the house .
11338,They stayed in this house until they died .
11339,"David took care of the women and gave them food , but he did not have sexual relations with them ."
11340,They lived like widows until they died .
11341,"The king told Amasa , `` Tell the people of Judah to meet with me in three days ."
11342,"You must be here , too . ''"
11343,"So Amasa called the people of Judah together , but he took longer than the king had told him ."
11344,"David said to Abishai , `` Sheba son of Bicri is more dangerous to us than Absalom was ."
11345,So take my officers and chase Sheba .
11346,Hurry before he gets into cities with walls .
11347,"If he gets into the well-protected cities , we will not be able to get him . ''"
11348,So Joab took the Kerethites and Pelethites and the other soldiers with him and left Jerusalem to chase after Sheba son of Bicri .
11349,"When Joab and the army came to Big Rock at Gibeon , Amasa came out to meet them ."
11350,Joab was wearing his uniform .
11351,"He had on a belt , and his sword was in its sheath ."
11352,"As he was walking toward Amasa , Joab 's sword fell out of its sheath ."
11353,He picked up the sword and was holding it in his hand .
11354,"Joab asked Amasa , `` How are you doing , brother ? ''"
11355,Then Joab reached out with his right hand and grabbed Amasa by the beard to kiss him hello .
11356,Amasa did n't pay any attention to the sword that was in Joab 's hand .
11357,Joab stabbed Amasa in the belly with his sword .
11358,Amasa 's intestines spilled out on the ground .
11359,Joab did n't have to stab him again -- he was already dead .
11360,Then Joab and his brother Abishai resumed the chase after Sheba son of Bicri .
11361,"One of Joab 's young soldiers stood by Amasa 's body and said , `` All of you who support Joab and David , let 's follow Joab . ''"
11362,"Amasa was there in the middle of road , lying in his own blood ."
11363,"The young soldier noticed that all the people kept stopping to look at the body , so he rolled the body off the road and into the field and covered it with a cloth ."
11364,"Once the body was out of the way , the people simply passed it by and joined up with Joab to go after Sheba son of Bicri ."
11365,Sheba son of Bicri passed through all the tribes of Israel on his way to Abel Beth Maacah .
11366,All the Berites joined together and followed Sheba .
11367,"When Joab and his men came to Abel Beth Maacah , they surrounded the town ."
11368,They piled dirt up against the city wall and began breaking stones out of the wall to make it fall down .
11369,"But there was a very wise woman in that city who shouted out to them and said , `` Listen to me !"
11370,Tell Joab to come here .
11371,I want to talk with him . ''
11372,Joab went to talk with the woman .
11373,"She asked him , `` Are you Joab ? ''"
11374,"Joab answered , `` Yes , I am . ''"
11375,"Then the woman said , `` Listen to me . ''"
11376,"Joab said , `` I am listening . ''"
11377,"Then the woman said , `` In the past people would say , ' Ask for help in Abel and you will get what you need . '"
11378,"I am one of many peaceful , loyal people in this town ."
11379,You are trying to destroy an important city of Israel .
11380,Why do you want to destroy something that belongs to the Lord ? ''
11381,"Joab answered , `` I do n't want to destroy anything ."
11382,I do n't want to ruin your city .
11383,But there is a man in your city from the hill country of Ephraim .
11384,He is named Sheba son of Bicri .
11385,He rebelled against King David .
11386,"Bring him to me , and I will leave the city alone . ''"
11387,"The woman said to Joab , `` All right ."
11388,His head will be thrown over the wall to you . ''
11389,Then the woman spoke very wisely to all the people of the city .
11390,They cut off the head of Sheba son of Bicri and threw it over the city wall to Joab .
11391,So Joab blew the trumpet and the army left the city .
11392,"The soldiers went home , and Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem ."
11393,Joab was captain of the whole army of Israel .
11394,Benaiah son of Jehoiada led the Kerethites and Pelethites .
11395,Adoniram led the men who were forced to do hard work .
11396,Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the historian .
11397,Sheva was the secretary .
11398,Zadok and Abiathar were the priests .
11399,And Ira from Jair was David 's personal priest .
11400,"The queen of Sheba heard about Solomon , so she came to test him with hard questions ."
11401,She traveled to Jerusalem with a very large group of servants .
11402,"There were many camels carrying spices , jewels , and a lot of gold ."
11403,She met Solomon and asked him all the questions that she could think of .
11404,Solomon answered all the questions .
11405,None of her questions was too hard for him to explain .
11406,The queen of Sheba saw that Solomon was very wise .
11407,She also saw the beautiful palace he had built .
11408,She saw the food at the king 's table .
11409,She saw his officials meeting together .
11410,She saw the servants in the palace and the good clothes they wore .
11411,She saw his parties and the sacrifices that he offered in the Temple .
11412,She was so amazed that it took her breath away .
11413,"Then she said to King Solomon , `` The stories I heard in my country about your great works and your wisdom are true ."
11414,I did not believe it until I came and saw it with my own eyes .
11415,Now I see that it is even greater than what I heard .
11416,Your wealth and wisdom are much greater than people told me .
11417,"Your wives and officers are very fortunate , because they serve you and hear your wisdom every day ."
11418,Praise the Lord your God !
11419,He was pleased to make you king of Israel .
11420,"Because of the Lord 's unending love for Israel , he has made you king to rule with justice and fairness . ''"
11421,"Then the Queen of Sheba gave King Solomon 4 1/2 tons of gold , a great many spices , and valuable stones ."
11422,She gave him more spices than anyone has ever brought into Israel .
11423,Hiram 's ships brought gold from Ophir .
11424,They also brought jewels and a special kind of wood .
11425,Solomon used this special wood to build supports in the Temple and the palace as well as harps and lyres for the singers .
11426,That was the last time such a large shipment of that kind of wood was brought to Israel .
11427,There has n't been any seen around here since then .
11428,King Solomon gave the Queen of Sheba everything she asked for .
11429,He gave her more than she brought to give him .
11430,Then the Queen of Sheba and her servants left and went back to their own country .
11431,Every year King Solomon received almost 25 tons of gold .
11432,"In addition to the gold brought in by the traveling merchants and traders , all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon ."
11433,King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold .
11434,Each shield contained about 15 pounds of gold .
11435,He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold .
11436,Each shield contained about 4 pounds of gold .
11437,The king put them in the building called the `` Forest of Lebanon . ''
11438,King Solomon also built a large throne with ivory decorations .
11439,It was covered with pure gold .
11440,There were six steps leading up to the throne .
11441,The back of the throne was round at the top .
11442,"There were armrests on both sides of the throne , and there were lions in the sides of the throne under the armrests ."
11443,"There were also two lions on each of the six steps , one at each end ."
11444,There was nothing like it in any other kingdom .
11445,"All of Solomon 's cups and glasses were made of gold , and all the dishes in the building called the Forest of Lebanon were made from pure gold ."
11446,Nothing in the palace was made from silver .
11447,There was so much gold that in Solomon 's time people did not think silver was important .
11448,The king also had many cargo ships that he sent out to trade things with other countries .
11449,These were Hiram 's ships .
11450,"Every three years the ships would come back with a new load of gold , silver , ivory , and apes and baboons ."
11451,King Solomon became greater in riches and wisdom than any other king on earth .
11452,People everywhere wanted to see King Solomon and listen to the great wisdom that God had given him .
11453,"Every year people came to see the king and brought gifts made from gold and silver , clothes , weapons , spices , horses , and mules ."
11454,Solomon had a great number of chariots and horses .
11455,"He had 1400 chariots and 12,000 horse soldiers ."
11456,He built special cities for these chariots .
11457,So the chariots were kept in these cities .
11458,King Solomon also kept some of the chariots with him in Jerusalem .
11459,The king made Israel very rich .
11460,"In the city of Jerusalem , silver was as common as rocks and cedar wood was as common as the many fig trees growing on the hills ."
11461,Solomon brought horses from Egypt and Kue .
11462,His traders bought them in Kue and brought them to Israel .
11463,"A chariot from Egypt cost about 15 pounds of silver , and a horse cost almost 4 pounds of silver ."
11464,Solomon sold horses and chariots to the kings of the Hittites and the Arameans .
11465,King Ben-Hadad of Aram gathered his army together .
11466,There were 32 kings with him and many horses and chariots .
11467,They surrounded Samaria and attacked it .
11468,The king sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel who was inside the city .
11469,"The message was , `` Ben-Hadad says , ' Your silver and your gold are mine , and so are the best of your wives and children . ' ''"
11470,"The king of Israel answered , `` Yes , my lord and king , I am yours now , and everything I have belongs to you . ''"
11471,Then the messengers came back to Ahab .
11472,"They said , `` Ben-Hadad says , ' I told you before that all of your silver and gold and your wives and children belong to me ."
11473,So give them to me !
11474,Tomorrow I will send my men to search through your house and through the houses of your officials .
11475,"Give my men all of your valuables , and they will bring them back to me . ' ''"
11476,"So King Ahab called a meeting of all the elders of his country and said , `` Look , Ben-Hadad is looking for trouble ."
11477,First he told me that I must give him my wives and children and my silver and gold .
11478,I agreed to give them to him . ''
11479,"But the elders and all the people said , `` Do n't obey him or do what he says . ''"
11480,"So Ahab sent a message to Ben-Hadad that said , `` I will do what you said at first , but I can not obey your second command . ''"
11481,King Ben-Hadad 's men carried the message to the king .
11482,"Then they came back with another message from Ben-Hadad that said , `` I will completely destroy Samaria ."
11483,I promise that there will be nothing left of that city !
11484,There will not be enough of that city left for my men to find any souvenirs to take home .
11485,May the gods destroy me if I do n't do this ! ''
11486,"King Ahab answered , `` Tell Ben-Hadad that the man who puts on his armor should not boast as much as the man who lives long enough to take it off . ''"
11487,King Ben-Hadad was drinking in his tent with the other rulers when the messengers came back and gave him the message from King Ahab .
11488,"King Ben-Hadad commanded his men to prepare to attack the city , so the men moved into their places for the battle ."
11489,"Then a prophet went to King Ahab and said , `` King Ahab , the Lord says to you , ' Do you see that great army ?"
11490,"I , the Lord , will defeat that army for you today ."
11491,Then you will know that I am the Lord . ' ''
11492,"Ahab said , `` Who will you use to defeat them ? ''"
11493,"The prophet answered , `` The Lord says , ' The young men who carry the weapons for the government officials . ' ''"
11494,"Then the king asked , `` Who should command the main army ? ''"
11495,"The prophet answered , `` You will . ''"
11496,So Ahab gathered the young helpers of the government officials .
11497,There were 232 of these young men .
11498,Then the king called together the army of Israel .
11499,The total number was 7000 .
11500,"King Ahab began his attack at noon , while King Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings were drinking and getting drunk in their tents ."
11501,The young helpers went out first .
11502,King Ben-Hadad 's men told him that some soldiers had come out of Samaria .
11503,"So Ben-Hadad said , `` They might be coming to fight or they might be coming to ask for peace ."
11504,Capture them alive . ''
11505,"The young men of King Ahab were the first to come out , but the rest of the army of Israel was following them ."
11506,Each of the men of Israel killed the man who had come against him .
11507,So the men from Aram began to run away and the army of Israel chased them .
11508,King Ben-Hadad escaped on a horse with the chariots .
11509,King Ahab led the army and attacked all the horses and chariots .
11510,So King Ahab made the Arameans suffer a great defeat .
11511,"Then the prophet went to King Ahab and said , `` The king of Aram will come back to fight again next spring ."
11512,So go back and strengthen your army and make careful plans to defend yourself against him . ''
11513,"King Ben-Hadad 's officers said to him , `` The gods of Israel are mountain gods ."
11514,"We fought in a mountain area , so the Israelites won ."
11515,"If we fight them on level ground , we will win ."
11516,"Also , do n't let the 32 kings command the armies ."
11517,Put your commanders in charge of the armies .
11518,Let 's gather an army like the one that was destroyed .
11519,"Gather as many men , horses , and chariots as before , and fight the Israelites on level ground ."
11520,Then we will win . ''
11521,Ben-Hadad followed their advice and did what they said .
11522,"So in the spring , Ben-Hadad gathered the men of Aram and went to Aphek to fight against Israel ."
11523,The Israelites also prepared for war and went to fight the army of Aram .
11524,They made their camp opposite the camp of Aram .
11525,"The Aramean soldiers filled the land , but Israel 's army looked like two small flocks of goats ."
11526,"A man of God came to the king of Israel with this message : `` The Lord said , ' The people of Aram said that I , the Lord , am a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys ."
11527,So I will let you defeat this great army .
11528,"Then all of you will know that I am the Lord , wherever you are ! ' ''"
11529,The armies were camped across from each other for seven days .
11530,On the seventh day the battle began .
11531,"The Israelites killed 100,000 Aramean soldiers in one day ."
11532,The survivors ran away to the city of Aphek .
11533,"The wall of the city fell on 27,000 of those soldiers ."
11534,Ben-Hadad also ran away to the city and hid in a room .
11535,"His servants said to him , `` We heard that the kings of Israel are merciful ."
11536,Let 's dress in rough cloth with ropes on our heads .
11537,Then let 's go to the king of Israel .
11538,Maybe he will let us live . ''
11539,They dressed in rough cloth with ropes on their heads .
11540,They came to the king of Israel .
11541,"They said , `` Your servant , Ben-Hadad , says , ' Please let me live . ' ''"
11542,"Ahab said , `` Is he still alive ?"
11543,He is my brother . ''
11544,Ben-Hadad 's men wanted King Ahab to say something to show that he would not kill King Ben-Hadad .
11545,"When Ahab called Ben-Hadad his brother , the advisors quickly said , `` Yes !"
11546,Ben-Hadad is your brother . ''
11547,"Ahab said , `` Bring him to me . ''"
11548,So Ben-Hadad came to King Ahab .
11549,King Ahab asked him to get in the chariot with him .
11550,"Ben-Hadad said to him , `` Ahab , I will give you the towns that my father took from your father ."
11551,"And you can put shops in Damascus , as my father did in Samaria . ''"
11552,"Ahab answered , `` If you agree to this , I will let you go free . ''"
11553,So the two kings made a peace agreement .
11554,Then King Ahab let King Ben-Hadad go free .
11555,"One of the prophets told another prophet , `` Hit me ! ''"
11556,He said that because the Lord had commanded it .
11557,But the other prophet refused to hit him .
11558,"So the first prophet said , `` You did not obey the Lord 's command ."
11559,So a lion will kill you when you leave this place . ''
11560,"When the second prophet left , a lion killed him ."
11561,"The first prophet went to another man and said , `` Hit me ! ''"
11562,This man hit him and hurt the prophet .
11563,So the prophet wrapped his face with a cloth .
11564,This way no one could see who he was .
11565,The prophet went and waited for the king by the road .
11566,"The king came by and the prophet said to him , `` I went to fight in the battle ."
11567,One of our men brought an enemy soldier to me .
11568,"The man said , ' Guard this man ."
11569,"If he runs away , you will have to give your life in his place or you will have to pay a fine of 75 pounds of silver . '"
11570,"While I was busy doing other things , the man ran away . ''"
11571,"The king of Israel answered , `` You admitted that you are guilty , so you know the answer ."
11572,You must do what the man said . ''
11573,"Then the prophet quickly took the cloth from his face , and the king of Israel saw that he was one of the prophets ."
11574,"Then the prophet said to the king , `` The Lord says to you , ' You set free the man I said should die ."
11575,So you will take his place -- you and your people will die ! ' ''
11576,Then the king went back home to Samaria .
11577,He was worried and upset .
11578,Ahab had 70 sons in Samaria .
11579,Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the rulers and leaders of Jezreel .
11580,"He also sent the letters to the people who raised Ahab 's sons saying , `` As soon as you get this letter , choose the one who is the best and most worthy among your master 's sons ."
11581,You have chariots and horses .
11582,And you are living in a strong city .
11583,You also have weapons .
11584,Put the son you choose on his father 's throne .
11585,Then fight for your master 's family . ''
11586,But the rulers and leaders of Jezreel were very afraid .
11587,"They said , `` The two kings could not stop Jehu ."
11588,So we can not stop him either ! ''
11589,"The palace manager , the official in charge of the city , the elders , and the people who raised the king 's children sent a message to Jehu ."
11590,`` We are your servants and we will do whatever you tell us .
11591,We will not make anyone king ; you may do whatever you think is best . ''
11592,Then Jehu wrote a second letter to these leaders .
11593,"He said , `` If you support me and obey me , cut off the heads of Ahab 's sons ."
11594,Bring them to me at Jezreel about this time tomorrow . ''
11595,Ahab had 70 sons .
11596,They were with the leaders of the city who raised them .
11597,"When the leaders of the city received the letter , they took the king 's sons and killed all 70 of them ."
11598,Then the leaders put the heads of the king 's sons in baskets and sent the baskets to Jehu at Jezreel .
11599,"The messenger came to Jehu and told him , `` They have brought the heads of the king 's sons . ''"
11600,"Then Jehu said , `` Lay the heads in two piles at the city gate until morning . ''"
11601,In the morning Jehu went out and stood before the people .
11602,"He said to them , `` You are innocent ."
11603,"Look , I made plans against my master ."
11604,I killed him .
11605,But who killed all these sons of Ahab ?
11606,You killed them .
11607,You should know that everything the Lord says will happen .
11608,The Lord used Elijah to say these things about Ahab 's family .
11609,Now the Lord has done what he said he would do . ''
11610,So Jehu killed all the people in Ahab 's family living in Jezreel .
11611,"He killed all the important men , close friends , and priests ."
11612,None of Ahab 's people were left alive .
11613,Jehu left Jezreel and went to Samaria .
11614,On the way he stopped at a place called Shepherd 's Camp .
11615,There he met with the relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah .
11616,"Jehu asked , `` Who are you ? ''"
11617,"They answered , `` We are the relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah ."
11618,We have come down to visit the king 's children and the queen mother 's children . ''
11619,"Then Jehu said , `` Take them alive ! ''"
11620,Jehu 's men captured Ahaziah 's relatives alive .
11621,There were 42 of them .
11622,Jehu killed them at the well near Beth Eked .
11623,He did not leave anyone alive .
11624,"After Jehu left there , he met Jehonadab son of Recab ."
11625,Jehonadab was on his way to meet Jehu .
11626,"Jehu greeted Jehonadab and said to him , `` Are you a faithful friend to me , as I am to you ? ''"
11627,"Jehonadab answered , `` Yes , I am a faithful friend to you . ''"
11628,"Jehu said , `` If you are , give me your hand . ''"
11629,Then Jehu reached out and pulled Jehonadab up into the chariot .
11630,"Jehu said , `` Come with me ."
11631,You can see how strong my feelings are for the Lord . ''
11632,So Jehonadab rode in Jehu 's chariot .
11633,Jehu came to Samaria and killed all Ahab 's family who were still alive in Samaria .
11634,He killed them all .
11635,He did what the Lord had told Elijah .
11636,"Then Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them , `` Ahab served Baal a little , but Jehu will serve Baal much ."
11637,Now call together all the priests and prophets of Baal .
11638,And call together everyone who worships Baal .
11639,Do n't let anyone miss this meeting .
11640,I have a great sacrifice to give to Baal .
11641,I will kill anyone who does not come to this meeting . ''
11642,But Jehu was tricking them .
11643,He wanted to destroy the worshipers of Baal .
11644,"Jehu said , `` Prepare a holy meeting for Baal . ''"
11645,So the priests announced the meeting .
11646,Then Jehu sent a message through all the land of Israel .
11647,All the worshipers of Baal came .
11648,Not one stayed home .
11649,The Baal worshipers came into the temple of Baal .
11650,The temple was filled with people .
11651,"Jehu said to the man who kept the robes , `` Bring out the robes for all the worshipers of Baal . ''"
11652,So that man brought out the robes for the Baal worshipers .
11653,Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Recab went into the temple of Baal .
11654,"Jehu said to the worshipers of Baal , `` Look around and be sure that there are no servants of the Lord with you ."
11655,Be sure there are only people who worship Baal . ''
11656,The worshipers of Baal went into the temple of Baal to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings .
11657,"But outside , Jehu had 80 men waiting ."
11658,"He told them , `` Do n't let anyone escape ."
11659,"If any man lets one person escape , that man must pay with his own life . ''"
11660,"Quickly after Jehu had finished offering the burnt offering , he said to the guards and to the captains , `` Go in and kill the worshipers of Baal !"
11661,Do n't let anyone come out of the temple alive ! ''
11662,So the captains used thin swords and killed the worshipers of Baal .
11663,They threw the bodies of the worshipers of Baal out .
11664,Then the guards and the captains went to the inner room of the temple of Baal .
11665,They brought out the memorial stones that were in the temple of Baal and burned that temple .
11666,Then they smashed the memorial stones of Baal .
11667,They also smashed the temple of Baal .
11668,"They made the temple of Baal into a public toilet , which is still used today ."
11669,"So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel , but he did not completely turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat that caused Israel to sin ."
11670,Jehu did not destroy the golden calves in Bethel and in Dan .
11671,"The Lord said to Jehu , `` You have done well ."
11672,You have done what I say is good .
11673,"You destroyed Ahab 's family the way I wanted you to , so your descendants will rule Israel for four generations . ''"
11674,But Jehu was not careful to follow the law of the Lord with all his heart .
11675,Jehu did not stop committing the sins of Jeroboam that caused Israel to sin .
11676,At that time the Lord began to cut away sections of Israel and give them to other nations .
11677,King Hazael of Aram defeated the Israelites on every border of Israel .
11678,"He won the land east of the Jordan River -- all the land of Gilead , including the land that belonged to the tribes of Gad , Reuben , and Manasseh ."
11679,He won all the land from Aroer by the Arnon Valley to Gilead and Bashan .
11680,"All the other great things that Jehu did are written in the book , The History of the Kings of Israel ."
11681,Jehu died and was buried with his ancestors .
11682,The people buried him in Samaria .
11683,His son Jehoahaz became the new king of Israel after him .
11684,Jehu ruled over Israel in Samaria for 28 years .
11685,At that time Hezekiah became sick and almost died .
11686,"The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and told him , `` The Lord says , ' You will die soon , so you should tell your family what they should do when you die ."
11687,You will not get well . ' ''
11688,Hezekiah turned his face to the wall that faced the Temple and began praying to the Lord .
11689,"`` Lord , remember that I have sincerely served you with all my heart ."
11690,I have done what you say is good . ''
11691,Then Hezekiah cried very hard .
11692,"Before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard , he received this message from the Lord , `` Go back and speak to Hezekiah , the leader of my people ."
11693,"Tell him , ' The Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says : I heard your prayer and I saw your tears , so I will heal you ."
11694,On the third day you will go up to the Temple of the Lord .
11695,I will add 15 years to your life .
11696,I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria .
11697,I will protect this city .
11698,I will do this for myself and because of the promise I made to my servant David . ' ''
11699,"Then Isaiah said , `` Crush figs together and put them on your sore ; you will get well . ''"
11700,"So they took the mixture of figs and put it on Hezekiah 's sore , and he got well ."
11701,"Hezekiah asked Isaiah , `` What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me , and that I will go up to the Temple of the Lord on the third day ? ''"
11702,"Isaiah said , `` Which do you want ?"
11703,Should the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps ?
11704,This is the sign for you from the Lord to show that the Lord will do what he said he would do . ''
11705,"Hezekiah answered , `` It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten steps ."
11706,"No , make the shadow go back ten steps . ''"
11707,"Then Isaiah prayed , and the Lord made the shadow move back ten steps ."
11708,It went back up the steps that it had already been on .
11709,At that time Merodach Baladan son of Baladan was king of Babylon .
11710,He sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah when he heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
11711,Hezekiah listened to the messengers and then showed them all the valuable things he owned .
11712,"He showed them the silver , the gold , the spices , the expensive perfume , and the building where he stored the weapons ."
11713,"He showed them everything in his treasuries , in his palace , and in his kingdom ."
11714,"Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him , `` What did these men say ?"
11715,Where did they come from ? ''
11716,"Hezekiah said , `` These men came from a faraway country , from Babylon . ''"
11717,"Isaiah said , `` What did they see in your palace ? ''"
11718,"Hezekiah answered , `` They saw everything I own ."
11719,I showed them all my wealth . ''
11720,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , `` Listen to this message from the Lord ."
11721,The time is coming when everything in your palace and everything your ancestors have saved until today will be carried away to Babylon .
11722,Nothing will be left !
11723,The Lord said this .
11724,"The Babylonians will take your sons , and your sons will become officers in the palace of the king of Babylon . ''"
11725,"Then Hezekiah told Isaiah , `` This message from the Lord is good . ''"
11726,"-LRB- Hezekiah said this because he thought , `` There will be real peace and security during my lifetime . '' -RRB-"
11727,"All the great things that Hezekiah did , including his work on the pool and the aqueduct to bring water into the city , are written in the book , The History of the Kings of Judah ."
11728,Hezekiah died and was buried with his ancestors .
11729,And his son Manasseh became the new king after him .
11730,Theoretically I 'll be here .
11731,theoretically ?
11732,yeah .
11733,"You mean , do n't you well , you carry multiple calendars , so you never know ?"
11734,Well I do have two .
11735,One in the office and one at home .
11736,oh
11737,The weekend after that %uh I will not be in town .
11738,"But , %um yeah ,"
11739,"as I say , theoretically I 'm here ."
11740,yeah .
11741,I have n't decided whether I 'm doing this yet .
11742,"It is a bit silly , you know ?"
11743,I was just there .
11744,"But I 've been , %um ,"
11745,the next weekend again I 'm invited for the
11746,let 's see
11747,"the child of my favorite cousin is being baptized ,"
11748,and they want me to be the godmother
11749,%mm .
11750,English .
11751,"Patentante , ja ."
11752,"Yes ,"
11753,"And , so , since I did n't go to their wedding , I -- feeling this big pressure ."
11754,I should have just gone to the wedding last year .
11755,"It was , like oh yeah . in"
11756,They started asking me when I was on vacation already .
11757,And so I 'm sort of
11758,"it 's easier to think about doing it when you 're on vacation yeah . than if you get this idea %eh when you 're at work and say , oh I ca n't go in four weeks ."
11759,How could I possibly just do that ?
11760,yeah I know the feeling .
11761,I m-
11762,"But once you 're in vacation mode , it 's sort of like well why should n't I ?"
11763,"I have the vacation ,"
11764,"it 's just you know , the time , and the money ,"
11765,and what is money for
11766,yeah .
11767,Right .
11768,So I have to make up
11769,It 's a debate .
11770,You sound like you 're the bank .
11771,No .
11772,But I have to make up my mind here by Friday because that 's when I can hold my ticket too .
11773,So I thought I could get a ticket .
11774,I just have to have a discussion with my boss .
11775,So you have to let me know what this entails as consequences for me ?
11776,"oh for ,"
11777,oh yes .
11778,"oh there are good consequences , if you 're willing ."

11787,"It 's because ,"
11788,"and if you 'd like to join me I 'd love it ,"
11789,I was also invited to a wedding on the twelfth somewhere near Duesseldorf .
11790,Between Duesseldorf and Essen .
11791,Well that can only be Rathingen or
11792,"No it 's north of Rathingen ,"

11916,Interesting people .
11917,If they 're having a wedding with Abendgarderobe then it 's going to be pretty

11919,yeah .
11920,That 's what I thought .
11921,Up upscale .
11922,And that .
11923,So think about it .
11924,"yeah . I 'll let you think about that ,"
11925,and you can write me a note or give me a call .
11926,Because I know some people really hate weddings .
11927,"But you 're afraid to say no ,"
11928,or you have to think about it .
11929,But it 's the twelfth .
11930,"And otherwise , what I 'd like to try to do is stay with you the twelfth and thirteenth . Because it 's weekend ."
11931,mhm .
11932,Like we could see each other .

11935,In Bad Muenstereifel ?

11944,Bad Neuena ja .
11945,"yeah ,"
11946,just a little bit down .
11947,But I think they 'll be in Munstereifel .
11948,"And then my cousin , she still does live in Bonn"
11949,so I 'll get to see her .
11950,And then I 'll zip off to Berlin Right . mhm mhm go to this wedding and see my favorite cousin .
11951,Do n't tell the other cousins .
11952,uh-huh .
11953,yeah .
11954,"Because you see , when I was there before I could n't visit you because I did n't want to spend time visiting these other relatives in Bonn ."
11955,"you 're so diplomatic about all of that , you know"
11956,"Well I mean if I was visiting you , it would be very hard not to visit them ."
11957,but n-
11958,But the year before I .
11959,"I would n't , %uh , tell on you , you know ."
11960,I know you would n't tell .
11961,But the year before I did it .
11962,"But that 's because of we just stopped on the train and I had , you know , two hours ."
11963,And we had our wild lunch .
11964,yeah .
11965,And on again .
11966,yeah .
11967,That 's
11968,"We , %uh , commiserated ."
11969,Yes .
11970,"That sounds like you have you know its positive end result , which is good ."
11971,I do n't know .
11972,"I mean , it 's a change ,"
11973,that 's for sure .
11974,It 's a change .
11975,"And it is a lot of work , obviously ."
11976,"yeah ,"
11977,"I ,"
11978,%eh but you know I really do n't know if it 's a lot of work .
11979,I always have this feeling I 'm just so terribly slow .
11980,I have this feeling I should always be doing these things much faster than I get them done .
11981,"Well , so what if you 're slow ?"
11982,"You know , look at it the other way ."
11983,yeah
11984,"but I always keep %eh that I 'm spending too much time , that I should be doing other things ."
11985,yeah .
11986,"I just had this talk about somebody who was you know , confirming , you know"
11987,and I know I 'm too self critical .
11988,So . It 's not a good idea .
11989,Because I was complaining to them about my mother
11990,"and they are this theory that , you know , what people do is a reflection of you ."
11991,%huh .
11992,Because this woman had such a that people react to you as a reflection of you .
11993,"And what I had mentioned about my mother bugging me was the fact that every time I see her or we even talk , she has to comment about my clothes , or what I 'm wearing ."
11994,and I was talking to this woman because she seemed to have such a good relationship with her mother .
11995,Like her mother treated her like a human being and not a kid .
11996,%hm yeah
11997,and so she said you know and she 's just a reflection .
11998,You know your mother 's being critical you know .
11999,Be you see that because you 're critical to yourself too much
12000,Or you 're filtering the information you get from your mother
12001,yeah
12002,but this is ridiculous .
12003,I mean %uh she 's never let up on that .
12004,I mean it 's crazy . You know .
12005,I do n't I mean
12006,and I think no not the last time the last time on the phone I bugged her about something else that I been trying to not take anymore
12007,but then she cries
12008,but that does n't work with me .
12009,uh-huh .
12010,That 's good .
12011,Then she says I 'm being mean .
12012,and I ignore the fact that she 's crying .
12013,I 'm pretty tough .
12014,yeah
12015,yeah
12016,"speaking of crying , I have a colleague . An American girl , a dancer . mhm at a school in Cologne mhm Who somehow or other has fallen in love with me ."
12017,mhm
12018,"and now that I 'm , going back to Duesseldorf she 's all going crazy . %um and thinks %eh"
12019,she 's %eh concluded that I 'm abandoning her .
12020,oho
12021,But it is
12022,Being stalked here ?
12023,Pardon ?
12024,"In America , we would say are you being stalked ?"
12025,so he said to let your wife do it you know
12026,%uh right
12027,he says %uh you know no I 'm going to
12028,%eh so now I 'm at a point that it 's very strange
12029,like I wo n't complain about anything
12030,or I ca n't complain about anything
12031,and I ca n't ask him to come help me in the middle of the night when I forgot to take out something they put in the freezer
12032,So we 'll see how it goes
12033,hopefully
12034,I mean they promise me you know everybody that they 're going to help me and that whatever I say
12035,But you know everybody gives you %uh these %uh pro-
12036,yeah
12037,so you 've already started
12038,Well I 've started working with Du
12039,like I do n't cook anymore
12040,I have n't worked in the kitchen for a week already
12041,I 've been just doing with him learning how to do the orders and meeting all the %um sales people
12042,and %um I 've learned how to work the computer which is the bigges-
12043,I said I do n't know how to turn it on even
12044,really
12045,So I 'm not
12046,I do n't know if I could do it yet by myself
12047,but he 's showing me teaching me
12048,and I think like the middle of this week he 'll be there a few days with me
12049,and then anoth-
12050,he %um
12051,Maybe here and there
12052,but he 's really basically
12053,What is he going to do
12054,He 's going to be a teacher for %um High school computers
12055,oh okay
12056,yeah
12057,so he 's only teaching three days a week
12058,so he always says that on the other days if I need him he 'll come in
12059,the truth is he 's been teaching and very patient and very good
12060,and he also is great that he has written down everything
12061,I 'm sure he 's thrilled to get out of there
12062,Well I 'll tell you the truth %uh
12063,I mean now that I worked with him one to one He does do everything with his heart
12064,I mean he has a different head than everybody else
12065,like I know that he wants everything to be nice and to be good and
12066,but he 's very separate
12067,and he does n't like to listen to other people 's %um ideas
12068,but %um I 'm sure financially he was probably great for the kibbutz because he was cheap
12069,yeah
12070,because he 's also
12071,I 'll tell you
12072,I worked with him this whole week
12073,he does n't eat a thing ever
12074,like all morning long
12075,so he does n't eat
12076,he does n't drink coffee
12077,I did n't see him drink anything water or anything else
12078,one day he said I better drink something I have a headache because it was really hot
12079,but I mean you know he does n't eat anything
12080,and then for lunch when we finally went to go get something to eat Also he eats like a little What we would eat maybe half for a meal
12081,and that 's it
12082,so I can understand now why he thinks that because he does n't have big eyes you know
12083,right
12084,that 's so funny
12085,but anyway
12086,no
12087,so he had agreed to do it for a year
12088,and his year is over
12089,I
12090,are you excited at all about it
12091,or
12092,well I 'll tell you the truth
12093,until I made the decision I was scared and also utz
12094,I miss the cooking part
12095,You miss it
12096,that 's funny
12097,I
12098,yeah
12099,yeah
12100,like this week even when they made the %um coleslaw you know & kept calling me to taste it and make sure that it was the way that I do it
12101,and so Matty said to me Ellen you did n't make the coleslaw
12102,I said it 's over you know
12103,I ca n't do everything
12104,tha-
12105,and they 're going to notice that the cooking is different
12106,Well that 's what even **ruthie** says you know
12107,everyone thinks that the economie is so important
12108,but there 's a lot of things that are very important of running the kitchen
12109,and we 'll see
12110,%uh right now Ramon %uh
12111,you know Cocoa she got married
12112,She married that guy
12113,not the Israeli guy not the Sephardic guy but No you 're kidding that little feminine kind of guy
12114,No
12115,but reme-
12116,when I was there in October she had that guy from Yerushalaim that guy
12117,yeah
12118,820.26_822.65_B: no
12119,but %um it was over already around then
12120,but they were still friends
12121,and this guy was a here or something drawer
12122,I think his family is Romanian or something
12123,anyway
12124,yeah
12125,it was very fast
12126,and they got married
12127,How old is she ?
12128,She 's eighteen and a half
12129,she 'll be nineteen in December
12130,oh my god
12131,why did they allow that
12132,Well I guess they did n't have a choice
12133,but the worst thing was originally when she came to her parents and she was going to get married she was going to get married in October
12134,but she got engaged like before Pesach
12135,so going to get married in October
12136,so they were n't so thrilled
12137,but at least okay it 's %uh
12138,and then all of a sudden they came back and said no we want to get married
12139,they got married the I think oh my g- second week in June
12140,on kibbutz
12141,yeah
12142,it was beautiful
12143,we do weddings %eh so much nicer than in the old days
12144,first of all we rent tables and chairs
12145,yeah
12146,so it 's like
12147,and we did it on the grass outside the
12148,and it was beautiful
12149,we read
12150,that
12151,so she 's like the first child who got married
12152,right
12153,and we rented beautiful china and silverware and glasses
12154,wow
12155,beautiful
12156,I must admit it was really really beautiful
12157,and then serving everything we use like %um all different kinds of bought kind of %um paper plates that
12158,uh-huh
12159,probably like the hard plastic
12160,and it was amazing because they even had like a bar set up
12161,and they had oh my go- fruit
12162,they had hay
12163,and then they had fruit
12164,it was gorgeous
12165,it was absolutely gorgeous
12166,Does she now have to do tzavah or no
12167,no no
12168,but %ah marriage is
12169,you do n't have to do the tzavah
12170,oh my go-
12171,So she 's working now in the vegetarian kitchen and the a little bit
12172,but she 's going to study in September
12173,so that 's not so long
12174,Does she cover her hair
12175,No
12176,oh I keep
12177,that other guy was real
12178,this one is
12179,I can not bel-
12180,oh this other one 's like from a family that 's not at all
12181,but he
12182,yeah
12183,they went to America for a month after the wedding
12184,her grandparents sent them %uh oh my Even though they were mad
12185,you know the typical Ariella story
12186,they came for Pesach
12187,and then they told them
12188,they waited to tell them that they got engaged
12189,and the wedding is in June
12190,and they were so angry because how the hell could they come back after years
12191,that 's true
12192,No
12193,so on one hand I understand them
12194,it 's not fair
12195,No of course not
12196,965.04_967.89_B: even they could have called them before Pesach
12197,maybe they would 've changed their minds
12198,but
12199,wait
12200,yeah
12201,Natan 's sister was here also
12202,So they were all upset that the grandparents did n't come back for the wedding
12203,but I do n't know
12204,you have to look at you know both
12205,oh my
12206,I ca n't believe she got married
12207,I
12208,she got married
12209,and then the week after Ta'al Paer got married
12210,you know Ta'al is the oldest %uh girl on the
12211,I
12212,yeah
12213,where is she living
12214,Well her husband he looks like Mickey our Mickey yeah when Mickey was really young
12215,so he looks really young
12216,%uh she just finished now the army
12217,and she met him during the army
12218,he 's from a nonreligious kibbutz
12219,oh my gosh
12220,yeah
12221,So now they 're living on his kibbutz %um because they allow like B'nai to live there
12222,but I do n't know they can work outside yeah do whatever they want until they decide what they want or do what they want
12223,do whatever they want
12224,study
12225,I do n't know what they 're doing
12226,his parents are n't even living on the kibbutz anymore because he 's a professor of something or other in I do n't know China or somewhere
12227,Singapore
12228,I do n't know where
12229,anyway so that was really weird
12230,like when she got engaged it was a little hard for Rachel because he 's not religious and everyone was really upset
12231,gosh you would think at least in Israel you would get what you want
12232,No
12233,but not only that
12234,what
12235,this kid just left the kibbutz at eighteen
12236,and now at nineteen he 's coming back with &uh you know like
12237,He also had a lot of different boyfriends during her lifetime
12238,anyway to make a long story short she had her wedding also
12239,but hers we did like %um a buffet
12240,so I was really nervous about that because when did we ever do a buffet
12241,so we rented the tables and chairs again
12242,and we rented all the beautiful dishes
12243,yeah
12244,But we set up the buffet
12245,we bought like these really neat
12246,you know like they 're
12247,Well we saved them because you can wash them
12248,they 're made out of plastic
12249,but they look like silver trays
12250,uh-huh
12251,yeah
12252,So we bought all different shapes and sizes
12253,and we put out the salads and the meats and all different kinds that
12254,we had %um little cocktail hot dogs
12255,and we had chicken legs
12256,and we had schnitzels
12257,oh and they made a beautiful basket with breads you know everything falling out on the table
12258,you know those kind of things
12259,no
12260,wow
12261,No
12262,it was beautiful
12263,it also came out really nice
12264,the only thing
12265,you guys must feel so old that you have married children already
12266,yeah
12267,we do feel old
12268,and it was beautiful
12269,Ramona 's was nicer because they had a great band and everybody was that
12270,you know like usually in a wedding there 's no room to dance
12271,but the whole parking lot was for dancing
12272,and on the grass was where we sat
12273,wow
12274,uh-huh
12275,so it was like as if you would 've seen you know dance festival because there was like a circle of men a circle of girls a circle of her friends a circle of his friends because there was enough room the kids had a circle that you could have like five six different circles all over the place
12276,oh my gosh
12277,it was beautiful
12278,and Ta'al 's
12279,what happened
12280,you know that Rachel was really worried that people wo n't dance for her be happy for her
12281,I do n't know why
12282,that was ridiculous because everyone was just as happy
12283,but her band they got stuck somewhere
12284,and their %um
12285,something with the electric equipment
12286,it did n't come
12287,so we had to get from us the amplifiers
12288,and ours are terrible
12289,%mm oy
12290,they could n't hear anything
12291,so So some people got really you know
12292,just they did n't dance
12293,and she was really upset
12294,I said Rachel why did you even bother paying them
12295,Well that 's true
12296,getting this really great group
12297,and even if we would 've known they were stuck so call the kibbutz
12298,we would 've sent the car to go get it
12299,right
12300,oh gosh
12301,so that was bad news
12302,but other than that
12303,so anybody else engaged
12304,not yet
12305,the rest are young
12306,well that whole class that whole first
12307,no
12308,but there was only those two girls Ta'al from the first class
12309,Ramona from the second
12310,now these other kids just finished high school
12311,like & 's oldest daughter is going to the army next week or two weeks
12312,wow
12313,but does n't she have a son who 's older
12314,yeah
12315,her son is still in the army
12316,uh-huh
12317,no
12318,but he 's not engaged yet
12319,I think boys wait a little longer
12320,mhm
12321,yeah maybe
12322,Is Liat still going with that guy ?
12323,Unbelievable .
12324,yeah
12325,things are g-
12326,%eh %eh thank God
12327,really very very happy .
12328,Very nice .
12329,great
12330,what 's with you ?
12331,"%uh , let 's see ,"
12332,well I 'm still hanging out at Westinghouse .
12333,yeah .
12334,I have your hat .
12335,I wear your hat all the time .
12336,oh goo-
12337,I thought you know it 's a good hat man .
12338,I sent that to you with all %uh good intents .
12339,I hope you appreciate it .
12340,I do .
12341,I wear it all the time .
12342,okay .
12343,%uh %uh I hope I have %um a picture of myself when I %uh had reserves . you know the other month .
12344,uh-huh .
12345,I took a picture %uh with me
12346,and I hope it comes out .
12347,I 'll send it to you .
12348,Thank you very much .
12349,%um
12350,If it does n't I 'll take another picture .
12351,Let 's see %uh
12352,Go ahead .
12353,Well I 'm still working there you know
12354,and %uh I 'm on a pretty good project .
12355,Right .
12356,a long term %uh next generation %uh fighter plane .
12357,Really ?
12358,So that 's %uh kind of good experience I guess .
12359,uh-huh .
12360,And %uh Westinghouse supposedly is making a bid to buy the %uh C B S broadcasting network .
12361,I thought they bought them already .
12362,"Well , you know , it takes months to close a deal"
12363,so there 's -- %ah . -- lots of speculation -- Right . -- that they 'll have to sell the %uh electronics division in order to do that .
12364,and what would happen with you ?
12365,I guess we 'd be sold to another company and see what happens .
12366,I do n't know .
12367,mhm .
12368,I 'm not too concerned about it though
12369,but it 's a possibility .
12370,But you have a senior position there .
12371,"Well , I suppose so ."
12372,"But , you know . They do n't really think of it that way"
12373,they just look at the numbers how many people they want and how many people they have .
12374,It 's just a business .
12375,Right .
12376,they just get rid of what they do n't want .
12377,uh-huh .
12378,But %uh that 's still going pretty well .
12379,%huh
12380,nothing really new with the house or anything
12381,We 've had some interesting incidents with wasps that have %uh been invading the neighborhood .
12382,they built a nest in my rafters of my house and busted through .
12383,"But I told you about that , I think ."
12384,I got a in the mail .
12385,yeah .
12386,So that
12387,Well I wanted to ask you what 's with the school ?
12388,The schools are extremely expensive .
12389,I 'm going broke basically doing that .
12390,And I do n't know how to %uh handle that .
12391,But how come they do n't help you ?
12392,It does n't make a difference .
12393,you 're still going to go broke whether they help you or not .
12394,They 're not going to let you run a profit when you 're on scholarship .
12395,if you have two thousand dollars at the end of the year they 're not going to say oh well %uh I guess you can have that .
12396,They 're going to make you pay everything .
12397,Wait a minute
12398,I 'm talking about
12399,wait
12400,wait fir-
12401,I 'm talking about your schooling .
12402,My schooling ?
12403,I thought you meant the kids ' school .
12404,My schooling ?
12405,yeah .
12406,I do n't know .
12407,I put it on hold all the time .
12408,took a course last semester
12409,I have n't signed up yet for the fall
12410,It 's a lot of stress .
12411,It 's a lot of stress .
12412,trying to
12413,you know you put out a lot of money
12414,and you have to work really hard to get it back .
12415,Right .
12416,there 's not necessarily any benefit to it either .
12417,So
12418,%hm .
12419,sorry I was talking about the kids ' school .
12420,Right
12421,the kids . yeah
12422,R J told me how much -- yeah . -- it costs .
12423,But meanwhile -- It 's a lot of money . -- she does n't know how much you pay .
12424,I do n't know why that is .
12425,I think what we pay
12426,%um %mm we have to %uh
12427,%uh for two kids it cost about two hundred dollars apiece .
12428,uh-huh ?
12429,And then for %um the taxes and everything else maybe if it costs %uh a year %um maybe %uh seven hundred dollars a kid .
12430,okay .
12431,That 's total everything .
12432,Pretty much .
12433,yeah .
12434,Pretty much .
12435,So we 're paying about eight times that .
12436,No about five times that .
12437,yeah
12438,five times that
12439,"No , actually , %ah we 're paying six times that ."
12440,I 'm paying four thousand two hundred dollars a kid . %uh Or more .
12441,Right .
12442,Right .
12443,But then you could also look into the other part . the tax bracket
12444,yeah .
12445,here f- %uh
12446,yeah
12447,forty - five
12448,"forty - five , actually with all the other taxes that are going on here"
12449,the first job %uh I pay forty - five percent -- mhm . -- my salary .
12450,It goes to taxes .
12451,"And then with all of my second job , it already comes out to fifty - five percent of that ."
12452,%mm %mm %mm .
12453,Plus the taxes .
12454,Unbelievable .
12455,That 's incredible .
12456,I remember I got the first paycheck
12457,yeah
12458,I pretty much knew that 's what the statistics were .
12459,Right .
12460,As soon as you get the paycheck and you see the before tax income and you say wow finally you 're able to get up to a decent number and then you look at the bottom
12461,and you say what is this .
12462,You put it into your little pocket calculator --
12463,-- you say they 're taking fifty - five percent
12464,says fifty - five percent .
12465,I say what country -- -- in their right mind takes fif-
12466,"what about %eh trying to encourage the populace to go to work and to save more , to earn more ."
12467,%uh they do n't care .
12468,But you still like it there ?
12469,Fifty - five
12470,But yo-
12471,"yeah ,"
12472,because you 're able
12473,You 're still
12474,%hm ?
12475,It 's great .
12476,It 's great .
12477,We enjoy it .
12478,The kids are happy .
12479,Having a wonderful time .
12480,yeah .
12481,And %um even with all the political nonsense that goes on here you still feel that we 're %uh %uh building the place in a very small way .
12482,And also the community .
12483,we love it here .
12484,Well I 'm sure you do .
12485,It 's a great community .
12486,yeah .
12487,yeah .
12488,It 's a nice place .
12489,It 's a very nice place .
12490,And I spoke to someone the other day %uh %uh about you .
12491,oh yeah ?
12492,Plenty of jobs .
12493,Are you serious ?
12494,Because you know what the problem is
12495,there 's a guy who 's working with me now who 's an Israeli
12496,and he 's active .
12497,Do n't believe them .
12498,What are they all liars ?
12499,"I mean , what 's the story here ?"
12500,You 're i-
12501,Yes .
12502,"First of all , Israeli who is living in America -- yeah . -- has to justify himself ."
12503,So that 's what he 's going to do .
12504,I suppose so
12505,because man he 's just like one thing after the next .
12506,"you 're into software , right ?"
12507,yeah .
12508,You know that guy Gordon %uh Go-
12509,%uh %uh I do n't want to mention his name .
12510,David Gordon ?
12511,No .
12512,oh
12513,oh I know
12514,the other guy who au-
12515,Right
12516,yeah
12517,the
12518,Ri-
12519,mhm
12520,That he said there 's absolutely no problem .
12521,No problem .
12522,%hm %hm .
12523,He said any kind of job at a very very high salary . %uh with %uh the experience that %uh you have is absolutely no problem .
12524,"yeah ,"
12525,so what am I waiting for ?
12526,Do you be b-
12527,%huh ?
12528,So what am I waiting for ?
12529,"Where does he live ,"
12530,in your community ?
12531,yeah .
12532,You still building
12533,there 's no housing available though there ?
12534,"%uh , housing is %uh right now %uh %uh %uh rentals ."
12535,Only rentals ?
12536,I would n't %uh ren-
12537,%uh you could buy
12538,but I would n't suggest it right now .
12539,But they have rentals ?
12540,yeah .
12541,And what do they rent it at ?
12542,You want to ge- %ah %ah %ah
12543,let 's see
12544,you can get a-
12545,Just a ex-
12546,For %uh a %uh nice apartment you can
12547,house like my size is
12548,the house I have -- mhm . -- would go for about five hundred dollars %uh five fifty a month .
12549,Wow that 's great .
12550,Right .
12551,So you can work down to a small apartment yeah %um which wo- %um probably go for about %uh three %uh hundred and fifty dollars .
12552,and where are most of these jobs located ?
12553,%uh
12554,Some of these Hertzolia
12555,Hertzolia
12556,yeah .
12557,That 's not so bad .
12558,Right
12559,Tel Aviv Hertzolia
12560,Even now they opened up a lot of new roads now they were building since you were here .
12561,uh-huh
12562,But %ah they were building while you were here .
12563,Right .
12564,%um and you can also
12565,Audrey said she got to Tel Aviv the other day in like forty - five minutes
12566,Wow . With the traffic and everything ?
12567,with yeah the traffic
12568,there was no traffic until she got right there to %uh yeah Tel Aviv
12569,%mm %mm %mm
12570,So yeah
12571,it 's a
12572,"But you 're talking about jobs in good places , good solid companies developing companies who %um"
12573,the thing just for the fun of it then %uh
12574,You know how I feel that
12575,yeah
12576,little Liz has her own reasons for you know being in America .
12577,"You should feel comfortable staying there ,"
12578,just for the fun %uh %ah send me %uh %ah a resume
12579,okay . I 'll do that .
12580,And I 'll just pass it on just to get an idea of how much you may be able to make .
12581,That sounds okay
12582,yeah .
12583,I think that 's a excellent idea .
12584,"%um , I know your wife does n't believe me"
12585,but %uh we think about you guys like continuously .
12586,and it really %uh makes my heart ache .
12587,But %uh
12588,yeah
12589,until like you find something that is n't stressful and not boring .
12590,yeah
12591,that 's the main two combinations right ?
12592,yeah .
12593,Not stressful and not boring
12594,yeah .
12595,Well it 's like I have no problems with secretarial work
12596,okay that 's what fitted in to that category because if you are a busy enough secretary you know %eh %mm . you do n't get bored because you are always doing something different
12597,and if your employer is a relatively decent human being you know two if's there
12598,mhm .
12599,but you get no respect
12600,I mean oh you 're a secretary
12601,and the pay is pretty crummy
12602,well it 's pretty much the same as what I 'm getting you know %um depending upon where you work and all
12603,but you know it 's like that 's no answer either
12604,so I 've just been toying with this idea of going back to school and getting a computer science degree so I can always be gainfully employed .
12605,"But anyway ,"
12606,and you can think about that pregnancy thing
12607,oh yeah
12608,that pregnancy thing
12609,yeah
12610,that
12611,do the
12612,Maybe there 's your hormones calling .
12613,yeah
12614,well no
12615,the funny thing is it 's like ten years ago I would 've said oh yeah that was what I really wanted to be doing is having a baby you know
12616,but like at this point in time it 's kind of like we 're going to do it because if we do n't do it %uh %eh you know in the next year or two we 'd regret it you know
12617,we figure it 's something we 'd want to do
12618,it 's not like we 're doing it because we have to do it or there 's peer pressure
12619,or well a %mm little peer pressure
12620,oh no no no
12621,I know exactly where you 're at because I think about that too
12622,I got about like six or seven years
12623,I figure my body is a very slow %um yeah **maturer**
12624,you know what I mean
12625,like I did n't get my period until I was sixteen
12626,I mean I look like about %uh %uh at least five or six years younger than I actually am
12627,-- and I 'm just starting to get my period actually now -- yeah yeah as an adult .
12628,So I kind of figure well I 'm probably good until at least some time in the early forties
12629,and I could probably go a little longer than that
12630,I know there 's a risk and all that bullshit
12631,yeah .
12632,but %um yeah I think about that too because it 's like I mean I kind of like the way things are going in the total lack of responsibility .
12633,I know
12634,well I mean that 's the thing
12635,kids are cute and all that
12636,and we %mm slept until noon
12637,we got up about ten and was like oh we have to get out of bed played with the cats fell back to sleep
12638,okay I mean we 're talking total slackers
12639,%mm
12640,and I thought gee you know if we had a kid we could n't do this you know
12641,and
12642,%mm
12643,No
12644,you got to be focused on that
12645,and I mean there 's a lots of other things that
12646,I mean as far as like living situation I was feeling kind of settled you know like -- Right . I 'm not going to be like traipsing around
12647,but I mean I could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe -- yeah . -- ten years alright
12648,even if I could project that far which I really ca n't
12649,yeah
12650,but I mean you got a kid you ca n't do fucking ten years w- --
12651,I know .
12652,-- it 's like cool I think I 'll go off to the Orient and start like bouncing from country country .
12653,I know
12654,well and I mean okay Emory wants to get his doctorate
12655,so we 'll know next Spring if he can get at least accepted into the program which hopefully -- %mm . -- you know
12656,and then there 's four or five years doing the damn work
12657,and %mm . He 's crazy
12658,he wants it
12659,that 's fine
12660,he can do it
12661,no problem
12662,but %um that sort of ties us up here although we like the place
12663,we 're in no hurry to leave it
12664,yeah .
12665,and that would be good
12666,But then you know what if he could get a position overseas again which is something both of us have said would be pretty darn good because -- %mm . -- %um you know after coming back from Spain from those two and half years it was n't so much an adjustment to the way things were
12667,it 's just asking the question gee do we really like %um the way things are over here with the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing
12668,I mean I 'm really in the nine to five thing more so than he is
12669,you know he should be there by oh oh well let 's say eight thirty to nine
12670,but yeah
12671,he does n't care when
12672,well okay
12673,%um and his professor is obviously %uh %uh a great person to work for
12674,so I 'm envious
12675,but %um whatever
12676,you know I 'm caught up %mm . -- in it
12677,and I do n't like it you know
12678,too many days I 'm working and eating at my desk at about twelve o'clock
12679,and I 'm thinking %mm . This is crazy you know
12680,in Spain %uh we had this break
12681,and you sat
12682,you talked to people you know
12683,you enjoyed your food
12684,you relaxed -- %mm . -- you know
12685,and it 's a fairly productive nation right you know
12686,What 's going on here ?
12687,yeah
12688,I mean they both have the advantages and disadvantages
12689,what you have to do is concentrate on the advantages in what ever place you 're in -- mhm -- and think about the disadvantages of the place that you 're not in .
12690,yeah
12691,Otherwise you go nuts right ?
12692,"That 's true ,"
12693,yeah .
12694,yeah .
12695,I know Laura tried to
12696,%uh because we have email and so she sent me a letter back saying you know remember how crowded the transportation is and %uh what else -- %mm . how expensive everything is
12697,and %uh you know I remember those things of course you know --
12698,And work you know possibilities were a lot more limited
12699,True .
12700,and the language you know yeah . constantly like kind of
12701,like I mean those could be considered positive things as well
12702,yeah
12703,but I mean you mind as well think of them in a negative vie- rather than
12704,mhm sure
12705,They just like worrying over them .
12706,Well you know and that 's why it helps to have kind of a glimpse into the future right ?
12707,And that 's how we got to -- %mm . -- Spain in the first place is we said we wanted to live abroad and we would try to do it you know as teachers
12708,and it turned out that way because -- %mm . -- we had this idea of
12709,and I really feel that that 's important
12710,and so what I 'm having an idea of now is
12711,okay you know Emory works on his doctorate
12712,it takes about five or six years
12713,we have the kid probably
12714,he gets a research position somewhere in France or in Spain %um
12715,and then we move over there
12716,and you know I take care of the kid and do some you know little day labor whatever you know
12717,we 'll see
12718,%mm .
12719,%um and we have relatively mellow life for who knows five or ten years
12720,and then we take it from there .
12721,yeah
12722,because even like you know I mean all that stuff right is all so subject to whatever change in the weather that happens to be right ?
12723,mhm .
12724,oh I know
12725,I know
12726,and it 's like you know what I think because I get the same as you
12727,like some days it 's just kind of like you know what the hell am I doing not with my life but ge-
12728,but I mean just like where do I get the animal just you know to do anything you know
12729,I just lay in bed and dream for the whole day easily
12730,yeah
12731,I know .
12732,Well I know
12733,I know what you 're saying
12734,I feel there 's sort of a line to cross too between really planning it out and worry and stressing over it because for a while a couple months back there I was thinking in terms of oh gosh you know can we ever afford a house
12735,%mm .
12736,and then we sat down and sort of looked at it financially and said is this what we really want to be worrying about right now
12737,and you know I realize no
12738,yeah absolutely .
12739,and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future
12740,or I know I have this tendency to do that .
12741,And miss the present completely
12742,I mean miss like you know the smell of the goddamn onions frying in the pan yeah . yeah yeah . you know and each little
12743,I mean it 's like as far as I 'm concerned there 's like no pleasure that 's as intense as the one that you are experiencing at that moment you know
12744,you can think about what something might be like or reminisce about the past
12745,but like when you 're there in that moment it 's
12746,I mean everything else just kind of like
12747,it 's almost like time does n't exist . yeah . You know
12748,yeah
12749,Well I know one of the best moments I can recall in these past two months is
12750,okay I get to work a little bit late which is common
12751,and they do n't really care since I 'm an hourly you know
12752,you have to be within a certain time frame
12753,%mm .
12754,and so everyone else is parked .
12755,I 'm way out there in the parking lot closer to where the trees are
12756,and you know I close the door
12757,I just take a deep breath as I go okay another day
12758,and I hear the birds singing --
12759,yeah .
12760,and I just stop for a minute and listen to the birds
12761,and it sort of cheers me up
12762,you know I realize what a minute okay
12763,in that nasty sterile office where the windows do n't even open --
12764,%eh %um I will be for the next eight hours or so
12765,but out here there still is some life going on
12766,and just sort of cheers me up to know that
12767,okay
12768,I can come back to it you know
12769,So that 's
12770,yeah
12771,in that moment I mean nobody is going to like interfere with that at all .
12772,There you are you and the birds you know
12773,yeah
12774,yeah
12775,yup
12776,hey we can find good Spanish wine over here speaking of the moment you know
12777,oh yeah
12778,And every once in a while you know I can remember just being back %um with people or eating some place you know in Barcelona
12779,and %uh so it brings me back
12780,but
12781,I still have n't gone to that fresh French restaurant by your house
12782,%um
12783,I 'm like dying to go there
12784,You mean the one right next to the apartment
12785,yeah yeah yeah
12786,Well it 's not French
12787,it 's just gourmet
12788,it 's gourmet catalon --
12789,oh it 's not
12790,oh I thought it was Fre-
12791,%ah really
12792,yeah yeah
12793,Well even better .
12794,save it for a special occasion you know
12795,and you know you might need a reservation too
12796,yeah %um
12797,yeah
12798,I will
12799,I should have some visitors
12800,and my family 's planning on coming this summer
12801,so I 'll take them there and this fondue place I wanted to take them to also .
12802,yeah yeah
12803,Is the one over in Gracia that
12804,it 's kind of on a corner I think
12805,I think I
12806,%uh
12807,no
12808,there 's a couple places in Gracia that I 've been going to
12809,uh-huh .
12810,But %uh there 's one in the %um Bario Gottigo
12811,actually it 's on the other side of Leotana %huh . Like down over by the Bornillo
12812,okay .
12813,And I 've only eaten there once alright
12814,but I 've been in a million times because every time I pass with somebody I have to show them the place .
12815,uh-huh .
12816,Actually you know I know where I 'm going to go
12817,I have a friend my friend from England
12818,I do n't remember if I told you about her
12819,she 's my old %um roommate mhm . From Oviato
12820,and she 's coming
12821,she got a job down here
12822,she 's coming on Friday to live
12823,mhm
12824,And %ah I
12825,this is like the perfect
12826,because when we lived in Oviato we used to go to this fondue place all the time
12827,that would be the perfect place to take her when she gets her .
12828,yeah
12829,yeah
12830,well I 'm glad to hear that you got a job that you like and %uh %um think that you were able to stay
12831,I was a little bit worried at first you know when you got back there because the money would run out probably in April or so
12832,and you know
12833,yeah
12834,And I mean I knew I would get a job
12835,and after I just stopped thinking about it I just thought well fuck it
12836,I am going
12837,it 's like inevitable
12838,and I want something
12839,I have to get something
12840,and I will
12841,uh-huh
12842,%um %huh
12843,But I just thought that you know I 'll get a job
12844,and at this point if I get desperate I 'll just have to take anything
12845,yeah .
12846,And the fact that I like kind of fell into something that 's Fairly sweet
12847,I mean %eh in the beginning everything kind of starts out nice
12848,but I 'm changing my attitude to the point where I 'm not going to get stressed out about it too much .
12849,I 'm not going to try to change anything
12850,Good
12851,I 'm going to go in there
12852,I 'm going to do a nice job
12853,I 'm going to have a good time uh-huh . you know
12854,and I 'm not going to
12855,I mean it 's not the same
12856,I 'm either
12857,like from working with kids
12858,I mean that was like you know my career for like eight years
12859,mhm .
12860,But this is you know more like
12861,it 's nice
12862,it 's really nice
12863,Well and you can always go back to that if you wanted to you know working at least in the States
12864,or maybe eventually once you have your residency yeah you can work in some place in Spain too with l- %ah
12865,yeah
12866,"yeah ,"
12867,I do n't have a big draw for it right now
12868,if anything like I 've always wanted to have like a bar or a restaurant
12869,I mean it takes tons of money
12870,yeah
12871,yeah
12872,me too
12873,well
12874,well
12875,But like I 'd love to
12876,That 's why I want to win the lottery first though Or to have enough background money to set that kind of thing up
12877,but %um well
12878,yeah
12879,well %um good
12880,and so you 're probably not going to come back Christmas which is cool
12881,Emory was telling me that
12882,so
12883,yeah
12884,and I probably wo n't
12885,%eh %eh if there 's anything that you think we should be %um working for let us know
12886,oh I do n't know
12887,I do n't know
12888,it 's too difficult
12889,%uh the thing with the Golan to give it back not to give it back I do n't know
12890,everybody has a different opinion
12891,we 've got cousins living there
12892,beautiful beautiful home
12893,and
12894,yeah
12895,yeah
12896,yeah
12897,I do n't know
12898,one half their mind is thinking should they pack the suitcases
12899,and the other half is should we add on another room for the new baby you know
12900,%eh it 's awful
12901,yeah
12902,it 's a crazy crazy
12903,it is
12904,Well what can you do
12905,it 's a terrible thing
12906,I spoke to your mother in May because I wanted to know if you were coming or one of the kids are coming out
12907,No

13364,Celebration Shooting Turns Wedding Into a Funeral in Southern Gaza Strip
13365,Asad
13366,1/20/2007
13367,Gaza - UPI
13368,"The cheers and hails of happiness at a wedding in Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip turned into screams and moans of pain after one of the celebrators lost control of his weapon , from which a number of bullets were released that killed the groom 's brother and hit three other relatives of his , turning the wedding into a funeral in moments ."
13369,A medical source at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younes told United Press International that Palestinian citizen Kamal Mohamed Al Bashiti -LRB- 33 years old -RRB- died shortly after he was hit by a gunshot in the chest from an accidental shooting at his brother 's wedding in Khan Younes .
13370,"Three other relatives of his were also injured in the accident , including two children ."
13371,Gaza Strip residents are suffering from the problem of aggravation from the weapons mess and security chaos resulting from the intense spread of weapons in the hands of security agency individuals and members of factions and families .
13372,"This is a common practice that claimed the lives of about 350 people last year , according to Palestinian human rights sources ."
13373,"Mohamed Al Bashiti , 18 -LRB- years old -RRB- , a relative of the victim , mentioned that while the young men were performing dances and popular dabke dances Thursday evening , and while they were in a state of intense rejoicing for the wedding of our relative , Majed Al Bashiti , one of the armed men lost control of his weapon , which he was trying to use to fire to celebrate and greet the groom ."
13374,The bullets went astray and hit a number of participants amid a state of panic and terror .
13375,"In moments , the wedding cheers turned into screams and the hitting of cheeks ."
13376,"The participants of the party moved to Nasser Hospital , which lay hundreds of meters away from the site of the wedding ."
13377,"The tragic news came after a little while : the death of the groom 's brother , who works in one of the security agencies ."
13378,"An elderly man said , "" I asked them not to shoot and asked them for God 's sake not to do it , but they persisted in it , until what happened happened ."
13379,"A number of women suffered cases of fainting and shock after the tragic accident . """
13380,"Some Palestinians are used to shooting in the air during their celebrations , especially weddings , as an expression of their happiness , in spite of the repeated warnings the Ministry of Interior has launched to chase those who take part in this practice ."
13381,"But the warnings were limited to announcements after each incident , without translating into actual procedure in reality ."
13382,"A researcher at the Palestinian Center for Human Rights , Yasser Abd Al Ghafoor , said this is not the first time victims have fallen in similar incidents , noting that the rights organizations observed several incidents in which victims fell and injuries occurred during wedding and celebration gunfire , one of the common misuses of weapons in the Gaza Strip ."
13383,"The city of Khan Younes had witnessed on the third of last July a similar incident , when the girl , Amani Al Raqab , died by a bullet that hit her by mistake from a revolver her brother was shooting off on his wedding day ."

13404,Google is broadcasting a new video recording of Saddam 's corpse after his execution .
13405,A new video recording depicting the corpse of the late Iraqi president Saddam Hussein after his execution on the morning of the first day of the Eidul Adha was broadcasted Monday evening on the Google Internet website .
13406,The video shows Saddam Hussein lying covered on a stretcher whilst the camera closes on him .
13407,Then the covering is removed from his face which has traces of blood on it in addition to a deep wound on his neck .
13408,The video also plays voices of those next to the corpse speaking to each other .

13439,Abd al - Bari Atwan : -LRB- President Saddam -RRB- Great in His Life .. Great in His Martyrdom
13440,Asad
13441,1/02/2007
13442,"This unprecedented Arab and international interest in the execution of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the barbaric way in which it was carried out , confirms the importance of the man , his prominent status , and his distinguished role in the history of the Arab region ."
13443,"The American administration , who planned carefully for this event through experts in media and public relations , and its tools in Iraq and the inclinations of public opinion did not at all expect such an opposite result , which along with the destructive consequences that may result from it in the coming days have caught them by surprise ."
13444,"Saddam Hussein proceeded to the gallows like a proud mountain , with head raised , standing upright , looking down at the insignificant things and insignificant people , believing in his creed and his Arabism , repeating slogans of pride and dignity , after he confirmed his faith ."
13445,He confirmed it by repeating verses from the noble Koran and the two testimonies .
13446,"He will be envied by all Arab leaders , both living and dead , for this honorable martyrdom , and this enormous love in the midst of hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims all over the different parts of the world ."
13447,"Saddam Hussein was the only leader in the modern history of this nation who went to the guillotine because he was a patriot who refused occupation and surrender to the invasion , and chose resistance ."
13448,"The only ones who preceded him in this honor were men like Umar al - Mukhtar and Yusuf al - Azma , by whose struggle the nation and its history were honored , and kept it for them in the records of pride and dignity ."
13449,"They hastily executed him because they feared him even when he was behind bars , just as they will still fear him as a corpse hidden under the soil of the homeland , and comparisons between his time and their bloody and chaotic time always came in his favor , and the calls for his return to save Iraq from its crisis and the corrupt and malicious gang that governs it have become deafening to the ears of the occupation and its accomplices ."
13450,He embarrassed them and dwarfed them by standing as a spear in the prisoner 's dock .
13451,They were terrified by the penetrating looks of his eyes .
13452,They were exposed by his patriotism and Arabism and his contempt for the odious sectarian divisions that they planted in their contaminated new Iraq .
13453,So they decided to get rid of him with a confused and embarrassing hastiness .
13454,Thanks to the technology of the mobile phone which enabled us to recognize the ugly face of the hateful sectarianism that is governing in America 's Iraq .
13455,"This tape exposed the government of the Green Zone , and blew up all the plans for censorship and fraud by the experts of the American Intelligence service and their agents ."
13456,"It presented us with the naked truth , without that being the intention of its owner ."
13457,"He was right when he turned to them and said , "" Are these your men ? "" when they were directing insults at him while he was proceeding to the gallows in magnanimity and with self - respect , repeating the noble words , "" and when the ignorant address them they say ' peace . ' """
13458,"Is it manliness to shout hateful sectarian slogans in front of a man who has never been sectarian , and the rope of the gallows is being wound around his neck , and his soul will go to its Creator in a few seconds ?"
13459,Are these the tolerant ethics of Islam ?
13460,"Are these the values of Arabism , decency , and pride ?"
13461,Are those the sons of the great Iraq which had always stood up against invaders throughout history and was a pillar of support for its nation and the causes of justice in the world as a whole ?
13462,"We are sorry , but not surprised , because some Arab governments objected only because the execution took place on the day of the feast of Bairam , as if the execution of this man would have been permissible and blessed on any other day ."
13463,We are sorry again because most of the Arab leaders hid in their palaces and none of them dared to speak even one word of protest out of fear of America .
13464,"We were stabbed twice , first when we watched an Arab leader being led to the gallows in accordance with sectarian justice which is spiteful and vengeful . And the second time when we did not see anyone among the club of leaders to which he belonged for more than 30 years object to his execution ."
13465,"Maybe God wanted a good end for him , and a good reputation , when He induced one of them to record what America and the government of sects wanted to hide , by means of the video of the last moments , which created a historic turning point that will perhaps shape the history of the region , and the nature of events in it for decades to come ."
13466,"Maybe God wanted to expose the series of lies of Muwaffaq al - Rabi the National Security Advisor in the government of occupation . -LRB- Where is that security ? -RRB- , who went out to the world saying that he , meaning President Saddam , was weak and collapsing while he was on his way to meet his God ."
13467,"Then the tape comes along and shows us with sound and image that we are in front of a courageous lion , who refuses to wear the mask , just as he refused to take the tranquilizing pills they offered him ."
13468,"Why the mask , and why the pills ?"
13469,"The mask is for traitors and criminals who are ashamed of their treason or their crimes , and the tranquilizing pills are appropriate for those who can not face history because of their bad deeds ."
13470,"The American administration committed a fatal mistake and revealed a major foolishness to be added to its many foolishnesses in Iraq when it executed this man , in a way for which it will pay a hefty price in the near future ."
13471,"His survival would have benefited it much more than his execution if they understood politics as they should , because his survival could have been a card to threaten the sectarians and keep them as servants to them and their schemes , just as it could have been a bargaining chip for calming down the resistance and the broad Iraqi sector which supports it ."
13472,"But they do not know anything except grudges , and they do not want anything other than inflicting more degradation on the Arabs and Muslims by his execution ."
13473,"Perhaps the American administration will have succeeded in one thing only , intentionally and with planning or without it , namely , deepening the sectarian breach not only in Iraq but in the Islamic world as a whole ."
13474,It was not by coincidence that Nouri al - Maliki signed the decision to carry out the execution .
13475,And it was also not a matter of coincidence that the task of carrying it out was assigned to spiteful sectarians as we have seen in the videotape .
13476,"Al - Talabani hid or fled , along with all those who participated in the project of the American occupation and gave it a legitimate cover , from the other sect ."
13477,This execution will deal a strong blow to all the efforts of national reconciliation .
13478,It will lead to the escalation of attacks against the American forces and those cooperating with it .
13479,It will pour more oil on the fire of the civil war that has already been kindled .
13480,Those who carried out the death sentence do not want reconciliation or to maintain a unified Iraq .
13481,"Rather , they are working to blow it up ; tolerance , forgiveness , and patience are basic characteristics not found in those people ."
13482,"Saddam had negative traits and positive traits , but he was not killed because of his negative traits , but rather because of his positive traits , which were his belief in Arab unity , resistance to the enemies of the nation , building an unprecedented industrial and educational foundation , and challenging America ."
13483,He chose resistance and rejected safe and luxurious exile .
13484,"The curse of Saddam will continue to chase them , chase the Americans , and chase his spiteful sectarian executioners ."
13485,"Just as Al - Qaeda emerged from the womb of Israeli arrogance in Lebanon and American arrogance in Iraq , Saddam 's Al - Qaeda will emerge from the womb of the degrading execution process ."
13486,Pendant of Soldier in Golan Since 1967 War Found
13487,The Cold of the North
13488,Gaza - Dunya al - Watan .
13489,Students at schools of the Qisrin settlement found the pendant of a Syrian soldier south of the occupied Syrian Golan .
13490,"On the pendant was written the name of the soldier , Mahmoud bin Ali , and his military serial number M 16241 ."
13491,"He was a Muslim , and his blood type was A+ ."
13492,"The two students , Alexander Ghuliyandrin and Oleg Darutsigh , said that they were on a trip last Saturday morning when they reached a military fortification near Qisrin ."
13493,It was obvious that man 's foot had not stepped on this place for a long time ago .
13494,"The two students entered the fortification where they found old medical equipment and a number of military helmets and a canteen , as well as a military pendant covered with mud and very dirty ."
13495,The two students took the pendant home with them and cleaned it and washed it .
13496,They were surprised that it did not belong to an Israeli soldier because the writing on it was in Arabic and they did not understand anything that was written on it .
13497,The two students took the pendant with them to school on Sunday and tried to consult the teacher to find out what was written on it .
13498,It turned out that it belonged to a Syrian soldier whose name was Mahmoud bin Ali .
13499,"His military serial number was 16241 , and the writing also indicated that he was a Muslim and his blood type was A+ ."
13500,"A senior officer in the Israeli army who fought in the Golan during the June War as well as in the October War , said that from the descriptions of the place and the fortification given by the two boys , they go back to the war of June 1967 , because the Syrian army did not establish fortifications south of the Golan during the October War ."
13501,"The officer added that the presence of the pendant in the place together with medicines and medical equipment indicates that the soldier was injured , and it is probable that his fate is still unknown to his family and relatives and no one knows what happened to him ."
13502,The strange thing is that the Arab and Syrian media are kept oblivious of these news stories which are concerned with the prisoners and soldiers lost in that war .
13503,What type of skin fits for beautification ?
13504,Beauty Lover
13505,-- Shock treatments can easily make you hypersensitive ; for getting rid of blemishes it 's best to go to the hospital .
13506,"In the public 's eyes , the beauty industry has always been both praised and blamed : on the one hand , it meets everybody 's demand for beauty , but on the other , after much major work on the face , many people feel that the results are limited , and in extreme cases the result is n't beauty but disfigurement ."
13507,Why is this ?
13508,"In the view of clinical dermatologists , the results at beauty salons are not obvious and there may even be problems ."
13509,"In fact because not only is the consumer unlucky , not choosing the right beauty salon , but to a great extent this is determined by whether they choose the right occasion for beautification and understand the results ."

13514,"While Qingqing was rinsing her mouth for the second time last night , mom said : leaks air and leaks rain ."
13515,Qingqing was unhappy upon hearing that .
13516,She pounded mom with her little fists .
13517,Dad also scolded mom : you also leaked air and leaked rain while your permanent teeth grew in your childhood .
13518,Qingqing looked at Mom with water in the mouth .
13519,"At last , she said to mom after spitting it into the basin : I meant to spew it on your head ."
13520,Dad praised Qingqing for being thoughtful : knowing what she should do .
13521,Qingqing played in bed after waking up in the morning .
13522,"Dad yelled , but she would n't get up and wanted to play a little longer ."
13523,Dad looked at Qingqing and teased Qingqing : how come this kid opens her eyes while sleeping ?
13524,"How come this kid sounds like "" enen "" while snoring ?"
13525,Qingqing told dad : I am just teasing you .
13526,"After she got up and dressed , she would n't eat the red bean buns or red sticky rice congee prepared by dad ."
13527,Instead she asked for soaked biscuits and did drawings in the room after finishing .
13528,"After a simple lunch , Qingqing wanted to buy stickers at Jinsheng ."
13529,She bumped into grandma on her way and also saw a lost dog advertisement on a wire pole .
13530,"Dad read to Qingqing , and then we arrived at Jinrunfa by shuttle bus , but could n't find the stickers that Qingqing wanted ."
13531,"We then went to Jinsheng , where we finally found them ."
13532,Dad bought four volumes : .
13533,One for each of her two sisters .
13534,One to be placed at Qingqing 's home and one at her kindergarten .
13535,Qingqing arranged everything very well .
13536,We got on the bus to dine out .
13537,Mom asked Qingqing to make a choice : is the back of the bus empty or full .
13538,"Qingqing first chose "" full . """
13539,"When it was almost there , Mom asked Qingqing to choose again , and Qingqing chose "" empty . """
13540,Qingqing said after getting off : I won .
13541,"Mom said : I intentionally let you win , otherwise you will lose ."
13542,"Qingqing wanted to pee on the way , dad had to hold Qingqing to pee by the tree ."
13543,"It was very cold , and dad tidied Qingqing 's pants quickly ."
13544,Qingqing wanted to play with the sticker after we arrived at the hotel .
13545,Dad discussed conditions with Qingqing : dad will let you play if you eat well .
13546,Qingqing agreed and began to play again .
13547,"Mom said she wanted to swap to another place , but dad wanted to let Qingqing stay longer in the sun ."
13548,Qingqing was so obsessed with playing that she would n't have dinner .
13549,Dad had to put away Qingqing 's sticker book and asked Qingqing to eat well .
13550,Qingqing said it was spicy and she would n't eat .
13551,Mom promised to buy Qingqing white fungus broth later .
13552,Qingqing became happy immediately and played on .
13553,"We walked home after eating , and Qingqing played in her own room after dinner ."
13554,"Dad said it was time to sleep , but she would n't sleep until after she played for a while in bed ."
13555,She told dad that she wanted to take one book to the kindergarten .
13556,"Qingqing said today : the teacher said last time that she would repay the money she borrowed from me the next day , but she has not repaid yet ."
13557,Oh ! Grown - ups would n't live up to their words either .
13558,Dad promised to remind the teacher for Qingqing .

13587,"A few days ago , another Taiwanese star passed away ."
13588,I had never heard of her .
13589,I hear she was a talented beauty .
13590,What a great pity !
13591,The accident was a car crash .
13592,"Much of the entertainment news denounced that +her car 's front airbag failed to release , which caused the death ."
13593,"In fact , the MINI COOPER she was riding in is not what the reports said ."
13594,It is the car with the highest safety index .
13595,"It is sold for 190,000 HK dollars in Hong Kong ."
13596,"Polo also sells for more than 140,000 HK dollars ."
13597,"It 's just a cute little car , preferred by girls ."
13598,But safety is surely not too big of a problem .
13599,The collision happened on the side and rear .
13600,"So , the side airbag and air curtain were fully opened ."
13601,They opened at the time of first collision with the protective fence .
13602,"The first collision was with the protective fence only , and the impact on the people was very small ."
13603,"In addition , there was the protection of the air curtain ."
13604,"So , there would surely not be a big problem ."
13605,The real fatal collision was the second one from the tailgating truck .
13606,"At that time , all the airbags were already deflated ."
13607,There was no protective effect .
13608,"Furthermore , the force of this one was extremely large ."
13609,"If the car had been stopped at an angle , then the head of the person sitting on one side would surely have hit the glass or the B column ."
13610,"Meanwhile , there would not have been too much of a problem for someone on the other side ."
13611,This is common knowledge .
13612,Then it came down to who had the bad luck of sitting on the side of the car that was angled out .
13613,"It was perfectly correct for the front airbag not to open , because the front of the car was not damaged at all ."
13614,None of the sensors received any signal of a collision .
13615,"Just imagine , this was a rear collision ."
13616,The people went backward abruptly .
13617,"Their bodies could have been supported by the seats , but the impact on their necks and heads was tremendous ."
13618,"When they went abruptly backward , any additional misfortune of the front airbag opening for no reason would have eliminated any chance of survival ."
13619,"So , of all the cars in the world , even a Rolls - Royce , the front airbag will not open during a rear collision ."
13620,"If the front airbag opened after being tailgated , that would be a quality problem , and would be extremely dangerous ."
13621,The safety airbag 's eruption could knock someone to death .
13622,"So , infants are strictly forbidden from sitting in the front seat ."
13623,That was how the whole accident took place .
13624,The result of the accident investigation division will not be different from this .
13625,"For this kind of accident , conclusions can be drawn from a single glance at the car wreckage ."
13626,The car and the car manufacturer have no fault .
13627,All of the car 's passive safety protections had already fully carried out their functions .
13628,"So , it is extremely ridiculous and unscientific to blame and suspect the car and the car manufacturer for such an accident ."
13629,"In particular , speculation about why the front airbags did not open was very amateurish ."
13630,Only by not opening would it have been correct .
13631,"If they had opened , her assistant might still be lying in the hospital ."
13632,"If an accident occurs on the freeway , please get out of the car and leave immediately if you can move ."
13633,"Many freeway accidents occur simply because people stay inside the car and sort out their thoughts , following which there is a fatal crash from a car following behind ."
13634,"About death , I have always believed that they do not leave the world ."
13635,They only leave the human world .
13636,"They are surely sharing the same world with us , with a different manifestation of life ."

13645,I have kept the good habit of having my teeth cleaned ever since I knew it could claim my life if I abruptly go to clean my teeth after years of leaving them uncleaned .
13646,"After my still upright but "" left - tilting "" teeth crouched in my mouth safely and soundly for another two years , another revolution erupted half a year after I graduated and found a job ."
13647,"The revolution could be said a rudimentary one , which made me decide eventually to eliminate all the betrayers and heretics in one action !."
13648,The incident was caused by a molar .
13649,The location of the tooth was just next to the broken wisdom tooth that led to my first visit to an American dentist .
13650,"For some unknown reason , when I was eating the other day , the tooth suddenly ached during the meal , and it was very painful ."
13651,"Unexpected I heard a "" crack "" while I was eating , and part of the tooth fell off !."
13652,I could not remember eating anything hard ?!.
13653,"I rushed to the dentist , who said root canal therapy upon seeing it , your dental nerve had come out !."
13654,I did not know what root canal meant but thought the name was quite fancy .
13655,It was after I began to receive it that I found it really painful !.
13656,"For example killing the nerves , and dealing with the dental crown ..."
13657,I asked the dentist then why my tooth broke .
13658,"After examining my 25 teeth , the dentist told me seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat "" cross biting "" due to the "" parallel shift "" of my teeth , such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other ."
13659,"The wrong position had led to uneven abrasions , resulting in the broken tooth ."
13660,I asked what solutions are available ?

13670,"Of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena ."
13671,"Most of the time , economic policy and economic theory are not aimed at individuals ."
13672,"In terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 ."
13673,"In fact , in the great majority of cases the economic theory is aimed at an entire group , or a subgroup ."
13674,"In terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories -LRB- here I 'm being inaccurate ; I hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with IO expertise -RRB- ."
13675,"But with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co-workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that is already a lot of people ."
13676,"Below I am going to refer to these 200 people collectively as "" his uncle . """
13677,"So whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : My uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney ."
13678,"In other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole ."
13679,"Here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and I have it ."
13680,"If Americans had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world ."
13681,"I believe that they made such a complete mess of the Middle East to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the Middle East , which is a completely different place from the United States ."
13682,"On this issue , China does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; China 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever China does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness ."
13683,Therefore I believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations .
13684,We need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense .
13685,So just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong .
13686,"When you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your "" common sense , "" you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world ."
13687,"[] It is All Right to Help Others , But You Have to Think Clearly First ."
13688,[] <POSTER> pplcat
13689,"[pplcat] No matter it is a car or money , you have to think clearly first if you are close to them and how risky it is ."
13690,[pplcat] You yourself would also be glad to give a hand to those in need .
13691,[pplcat] Those who receive help should have a grateful heart .
13692,[pplcat] It would be laudable if such good virtue of helping others can be carried on and more people can become your beneficiaries .
13693,[pplcat] Real - world conflicts often lie in the contradictions between the expectations of those who help and the returns of those who are helped .
13694,"[pplcat] The human nature is you hope to receive basic respect when you help others , no matter if the beneficiary acts in return ."
13695,[pplcat] Of course it is better to get something in return .
13696,"Practically everyone would say they ask for nothing in return when they help others , but when they need a favor from others , they will first think of their beneficiaries ."
13697,"[pplcat] They would become disappointed when the other person fall below their expectations , regretting they have helped the wrong guy ."
13698,[pplcat] Those who are helped would n't like to owe others a favor .
13699,[pplcat] Those who can manage things skillfully will offset the favor in all kinds of ways .
13700,"[pplcat] If the requirements from a past benefactor go beyond the bottom line they perceive , the human nature will make them believe the other guy is greedy or giving small favor for big ."
13701,"Thus , they would be slowly alienated and begin to refuse ."
13702,[pplcat] The other guy would also begin to feel unhappy .
13703,"[pplcat] A person has no eternal enemy or eternal friend , but eternal interests ."
13704,[pplcat] My personal principle of helping others : 1. Be familiar with his character .
13705,2. Low risk .
13706,3. The other guy has no sense of superiority .
13707,"[pplcat] As a rule , I never help beauties or children of senior cadres ."
13708,"[pplcat] It is my personal opinion , and please excuse me if anything is offensive ."
13709,[] <POSTER> jingzhe19
13710,"[jingzhe19] However , the post of driving on a snowy day reminds me again of the story of Hua Xin and Wang Lang in the New Anecdotes of Social Talk ."
13711,"[jingzhe19] The two guys was fleeing for life in a carriage , when they met a hitch hiker on their way ."
13712,"[jingzhe19] Hua Xin was hesitant and reluctant , but Wang Lang said it was fine to carry him as there is still a seat on the carriage ."
13713,[jingzhe19] So he let him on .
13714,"[jingzhe19] After the guy got on , the carriage was chased by bandits ."
13715,Wang Lang was scared and wanted to drop the guy to reduce the load of the carriage .
13716,"[jingzhe19] Hua Xin said the reason why I would n't let him on earlier was that I was afraid of such things ; now that he is already aboard , how can we drop him ."
13717,[jingzhe19] Eventually the group escaped together .
13718,"[jingzhe19] Well , I support the thread starter for the post , but I also think the practice of Hua Xin seems wiser ."
13719,"[jingzhe19] -LRB- In the master piece of pplcat -LRB- pplcat -RRB- , it is mentioned : -RRB- ."
13720,"[jingzhe19] : No matter it is a car or money , you have to think clearly first if you are close to them and how risky it is ."
13721,You yourself would also be glad to [jingzhe19] : give a hand to those in need .
13722,Those who receive help should have a grateful heart .
13723,It would be laudable if such good virtue of helping others [jingzhe19] : can be carried on and more people can become your beneficiaries .
13724,[jingzhe19] : Real - world conflicts often lie in the contradictions between the expectations of those who help and the returns of those who are helped .
13725,"The human nature is [jingzhe19] : you hope to receive basic respect when you help others , no matter if the beneficiary acts in return ."
13726,Of course it is [jingzhe19] : better to get something in return .
13727,"Practically everyone would say they ask for nothing in return when they help others , but when they need a favor from others [jingzhe19] : , they will first think of their beneficiaries ."
13728,"They would become disappointed when the other person fall below their expectations , regretting they have helped [jingzhe19] : the wrong guy ."
13729,[jingzhe19] : Those who are helped would n't like to owe others a favor .
13730,Those who can manage things skillfully will offset the favor in all kinds of ways .
13731,"If the requirements [jingzhe19] : from a past benefactor go beyond the bottom line the perceive , the human nature will make them believe the other guy is greedy or giving small favor for big"
13732,"As both consortiums in Singapore will employ the technology to connect fiber optic cables to home , in the future Singaporean consumers will be able to enjoy high - speed Internet of up to 1 Gbps , which is 10 times faster than the current highest Internet speed ."
13733,Tender for network companies for Singapore 's next - generation national broadband network has recently closed .
13734,"The Infocomm Development Authority received proposals from two consortiums , one of which claims it could complete laying of the network two and a half years ahead of schedule ."
13735,The winning consortium can receive government grants of up to S $ 750 million .
13736,"As both consortiums will employ the technology to connect fiber optic cables to home , in the future Singaporean consumers will be able to enjoy high - speed Internet of up to 1 Gbps , which is 10 times faster than the current highest Internet speed ."
13737,"OpenNet , a consortium led by Canadian company AxiaNetMedia , claims it could be two and a half years ahead of the timetable drafted by iN2015 , which means completing laying of the fiber optic network by June 2010 ."
13738,"Investors of the OpenNet consortium include SingTel -LRB- 30 % -RRB- , Singapore Press Holdings -LRB- 25 % -RRB- and Singapore Power Telemedia -LRB- 15 % -RRB- ."
13739,Records indicate that Mother Nature has meted out punishment to humankind on a total of three occasions during the last one - hundred years .
13740,Two of these instances were in China .
13741,"One instance was the great flood of 1931 , in which in excess of 3.5 million people died in China ."
13742,"The second instance was the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake , where over 250 thousand died ."
13743,More than 120 thousand people died in this current tsunami .
13744,"Although there is a diminishing trend to the number of casualties in these three disasters , the figure of 120 thousand is nonetheless alarming indeed ."
13745,"Where the beaches of these countries were littered with human bodies , surprisingly there were no wild animal corpses to be found ."
13746,"Some animals , including elephants , during the preceding few days had already taken to their heels and headed for the mountains ."
13747,And only after the tsunami was over did they come down to search for water .
13748,Is this an accident ?
13749,Run Taoyan tells us it is n't !
13750,"My home is in the plains to the south of Beijing , not a great distance away from Tangshan ."
13751,"However , damage to buildings in the earthquake was not too serious ."
13752,"In the days leading up to the Tangshan earthquake , horses , cows and sheep did not seek shelter , ducks and chickens stayed out of the coop - even mice crossing the road were a widespread phenomenon ."
13753,"As the Beijing Olympic Games draw near , the human rights record of the Chinese government are continuing to gain greater attention ."
13754,"Chinese writer Zhou Yuanzhi was detained a few days earlier for inciting subversion , and an editor for a well - known newspaper was removed from office ."
13755,"Last Saturday , Zhou Yuanzhi was arrested by Chinese National Security agents in the city of Zhongxiang , Hubei ."
13756,"According to International PEN -LRB- Voice of America -RRB- , an organization for writers , Zhou Zhiyuan was officially detained on Monday for inciting subversion of the state ."
13757,"Zhou Yuanzhi , 47 , was a taxation officer ."
13758,He lost his job and was expelled from the Communist Party in 1992 as a result of contributing an article to Voice of America -LRB- Voice of America -RRB- .
13759,"Since then , he has published several hundred articles and two books under different pen names ."
13760,"Many of the articles criticized the issue of corruption , while quite a few touched on sensitive issues such as Tibet and the Beijing Olympic Games ."
13761,"In a joint statement , International PEN USA branch , Canada branch and the Independent Chinese PEN Centre said Zhou Yuanzhi was the 40th writer whom China has detained so far ."
13762,"Marx strictly demarcated the boundary between scientific socialism and bourgeois humanitarianism , mercilessly discarding the humanitarianism of the capitalist class . Shrewdly noting that after scientific socialism had taken root , the key weakness of humanitarianism =bewitchment was in denying revolution , supplanting scientific socialism . While the Southern Weekend used the Wenchuan Earthquake as a pretext , dramatizing the horror and tragedy of the earthquake , to take the opportunity to beat the drum for bourgeois humanitarianism , saying , "" The sound of the alarm was a wimpering , sobbing , but even more a call , calling for us to realize human dignity again , calling for us to realize value of life again . "" As if our socialist New China has never placed importance on the "" value of life "" , and therefore needs this earthquake to "" call for "" us to "" realize human dignity again "" and "" realize value of life again "" !"
13763,"In the socialist New China , naturally there is n't the "" dignity "" of landlord capitalist masters , even during the crackdown on counter-revolutionaries , the "" value of life "" of the counter revolutionaries was ruthlessly divested ."
13764,Instead there is the dignity of workers and the peasants not to be oppressed and exploited !
13765,The value of life for workers and peasants is countless times higher now than compared with old society .
13766,This type of exploitation can only push them further into destitution and will make their lives more difficult in the future .
13767,"They made donations , and society accepted their donations ."
13768,"Supposing they experience hardships later in their lives , or if they fall ill , who will give donations for them or look after them ?"
13769,"If our country had set up a mechanism to provide social security to the people in terms of livelihood , pensions , medical care , clothing and food , then it would be acceptable to take such donations of the poor , but have we set one up ?"
13770,"What rationale is there in our not dealing with the extravagance and corruption of the bureaucrats , but actually accepting the donations of the poor ?"
13771,""" One meal for the bureaucrats is a year 's worth of grain to the poor , "" and even several years ' worth ."
13772,There can be no justification for us to ask the poor for donations .
13773,"The ordinary people simply do not know whether our bureaucrats , while they consume a year 's grain for a poor person at one meal , can eat it calmly , and can swallow it ."
13774,You could say that the =top social strata have been generous to foreigners and to foreign capital during the reform and opening - up .
13775,"In order to draw in foreign capital , we have given the foreigners an array of all sorts of dazzling preferential policies , whether they could be given or not , and also gave the foreigners far too much better treatment over our countrymen , allowing the foreigners to make money hand over fist during China 's reform and opening - up ."
13776,The Wenchuan Earthquake wrought massive destruction on those in its path .
13777,"According to incomplete statistics , as of 7 pm on the 13th , 12,012 victims had died in the Sichuan quake zone , 9,404 people were buried in the rubble , 7,841 were missing , with 26,206 being treated in hospital ."
13778,"In the blink of an eye , more than ten thousand souls bursting with life departed this earth forever , in the blink of an eye tens of thousands became trapped in the rubble ."
13779,"For those who already died , we can but regret , can only grieve ."
13780,"However , most distressing were those survivors still buried in the rubble ."
13781,"Following the big quake was an accompaniment of aftershocks of varying sizes striking at random , along with stormy adverse weather conditions ."
13782,"One could say that each aftershock , as far as those survivors were concerned , represented an extremely serious danger , an incredibly tough life ordeal ."
13783,It can be imagined what kind of desperate and anxious frame of mind those survivors buried under the rubble must have been in !
13784,The world that they faced would have been a terribly dark world indeed !
13785,"In such circumstances as these , I can only offer up blessings , hoping beyond hope that those people still surviving can somehow get through it all safely ."
13786,"We can only pray , pray that Heaven will open its eyes and protect those suffering countrymen ."
13787,We can only call out loudly inside our hearts : Earthquake victims hold on !
13788,"Like the Great Tangshan Earthquake , the earthquake in Wenchuan , Sichuan , this time has rendered people as helpless as ants and caused enormous loss of human lives and property ."
13789,"However , one issue not to be ignored is that loss is =particularly concentrated at schools and student casualties are =particularly heavy , which has become the biggest highlight of the earthquake ."
13790,"The great earthquake of magnitude 7.8 has revealed the "" jerry - built project "" nature of school buildings ."
13791,"We should say although the great earthquake could n't have been resisted , the "" jerry - built projects "" have further stabbed the wounds of the disaster victims , becoming another killer of the nation 's future blossoms ."
13792,"Why has the strong earthquake disaster revealed the "" jerry - built "" phenomenon in our school building projects ?"
13793,"In recent years , the country has invested heavily in education , especially in its effort to develop school buildings ."
13794,"The slogan "" the best buildings are schools "" has also become the common understanding of local governments and competent education authorities ."
13795,"People of all social circles have also contributed a lot of money and energy to the "" Hope Project . """
13796,Yet how come we have so few best - quality buildings ?
13797,"How come we have spent large sums of money , in exchange for a "" jerry - built project "" that brings irreparable losses to people 's lives and property ?"
13798,Do commodity prices have a base value worth talking about ?
13799,Do commodities have a true value ?
13800,These are already elements of uncertainty .
13801,"With things , less is more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy ."
13802,"In fact , in a socialist country one can not act in that way ."
13803,"In the area of profiting from commodities , there have been no systems in place and no legal provisions ever since the reforms , there is no last word on how many multiples of cost profits are allowed to be , or what percentage ."
13804,"China 's self - sufficient , natural economy was not without any advantages ."
13805,"At least it did n't try to reap large profits off its own people , now the exact opposite is the case ."
13806,"A home appliance - whether you are Chinese or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you are a big city or a small city , whether you are a worker or a peasant - is always the same price ."
13807,"Not knowing how much profit is in there , not caring who can afford it and who ca n't , these do not seem to be the principles of socialism ."
13808,"And with farmers ' grain and rural products , if the country does n't wipe out agricultural taxes and does n't offer any subsidies , keeping on producing is a problem ."
13809,"In order to improve the people 's living standards , the government -LRB- set things so that -RRB- grain is always the same price whether sold to big cities or to rich people ."
13810,"With this kind of ratio in existence , in struggling areas trying for a comfortable life is very difficult ."
13811,This issue should attract the close attention of economists .
13812,"When she was alive , mother often said : "" Joy comes never more than once but sorrows never come singly ! """
13813,"Women of her times , who have had their feet bound for a few days , are accustomed to troubles and tribulations ."
13814,"Hardworking , enduring and having a higher IQ than me , she never went to school , hence illiterate , yet queerly , she could read out loud the entire Holy Bible ."
13815,"She borne 11 children and took seven of them with her as refugees for several years , having nothing valuable on her , yet not a single one died ."
13816,She passed away in 1992 at an age of 91 .
13817,How I wish mother could live till today to see today 's China .
13818,"This year marks the 30th anniversary of China 's economic reform , as well as the big day of the Beijing Olympic Games ."
13819,"With two happy events arriving , any ill luck should have been turned into good luck ."
13820,"Sadly feng shui is not on our side , and disasters are especially plenty ."
13821,Wen Jiabao has indeed been hardworking .
13822,My salute to this mister .
13823,"Let 's put aside things like the snow disaster and focus on two : one being the Tibetan incident on March 14 , and the other of course being May 12 great earthquake in Sichuan ."
13824,"Busyboys say the "" eight "" characters were against us ."
13825,"Three , one and four add up to eight , five , one and two also add up to eight , and May 15 is 88 days away from the Olympics ."
13826,"I 've discussed it here by borrowing from Germans ' crystal ball : once what 's ominous is spoken , things will turn auspicious ."
13827,"Secondly , Tencent brought the time and user dimensions together ."
13828,"This so - called time refers to how at the start of the incident , after Tencent had promptly reported it , it launched a special contingency plan ."
13829,The company immediately made a decision to donate a million .
13830,People were satisfied with the promptitude of their action .
13831,"Afterwards , Tencent also increased its donation to RMB 10 million in view of the development of the situation , becoming one of the Internet enterprises making the largest donations to the earthquake disaster area ."
13832,"At the same time as this , each of Tencent 's main platforms began to call on web users to make donations , and the integration at the same time of Tenpay and Tencent 's welfare platform took place as a result of this ."
13833,Users could not only support the disaster zone by making donations ; they could also get published on Tencent 's platform by writing articles to express their own friendly wishes for the people of the disaster zone .
13834,"We need to integrate our marketing focus , seize opportunities in current events , and conduct our marketing as appropriate ."
13835,We need to lay stress on integrating and meeting the different needs that consumers have of our products .
13836,"Once again , Tencent has integrated all kinds of link - up methods ."
13837,"This so - called "" link - up "" refers to how , at the same time that Tencent was calling for disaster relief , it was using all kinds of media to organize and publicize good people and good deeds to encourage more enterprises and individuals to do their utmost for the people of the disaster zone ."
13838,"In Sichuan province alone , more than four million buildings collapsed and were damaged in the earthquake ."
13839,"Since May 12 , the millions of people who successively evacuated from the disaster areas in Sichuan were relocated to Chengdu , Deyang , Miaoyang , and their surrounding cities ."
13840,Most of them live in temporary tents or makeshift shelters .
13841,"Although their life for the short term is expected to have no big problems , after carrying out earthquake relief for one week , the long - term living arrangements for the disaster - stricken people have started to draw the attention of many parties ."
13842,"As of now , there are n't many enterprises involved in producing tents in the two cities , only Susino Umbrella Co. , Ltd ."
13843,But there are a lot of enterprises that produce tent material .
13844,"Currently , warp - knitted or machine - knitted high - strength polyester fabric is mainly used as the base fabric for all the cloth that makes up the tents ."
13845,"Between the two cities , the companies engaged in the production of polyester are mainly Chunhui Co. , Ltd and S - Yi Hua , among others ."
13846,"As for the production of the temporary homes , materials needed for the construction will entirely be insulating , fireproof , recyclable and environmentally friendly ."
13847,"Currently , the main producers of energy - saving building materials in the two cities are Shuang Liang Co. , Ltd , Yantai , Wanhua , BNBM , and so on ."
13848,In fact I used to write frequently about my wife .
13849,"She , of course , should be my girlfriend at that time , but in our minds we had long considered ourselves as husband and wife ."
13850,Days of triviality and helplessness frittered away much of my passion and fantasy .
13851,"I never had the desire to smile too often as time went by , and she was constantly concerned about my moodiness ."
13852,"Yet , she never seemed to have any reservation in her effort and contribution ."
13853,"In addition to taking care of me , an almost mentally sick man , she also had to budget carefully for this family , using our meager income to build up bit by bit a tiny sense of security and happiness ."
13854,"She had never despised me for my poverty , nor had she ever asked anything from me ."
13855,"At one time , she just longed to have a home we could call our own ."
13856,At that time buying a house was beyond my imagination .
13857,"Because of that , I once also suspected whether she had made too high a demand on me ."
13858,It made me very sad during that period .
13859,"However , I also knew that we indeed needed a home ."
13860,I also had the obligation to give her a home .
13861,"She came to this strange land for me , with no relatives or friends ."
13862,I should give her a place where she could be shielded from winds and rains .
13863,Operations of the US economy is much reliant on low oil prices .
13864,"In 2002 , international oil prices were at a level of about USD $ 25 a barrel ."
13865,"In the low - oil - price era , oil spending of consumers only accounted for a relatively small proportion of their individual income ."
13866,Enterprises were able to invest and expand at a low cost .
13867,"That is to say in the low - oil - price era , America 's existing economic model was able to continue without large - scale technological revolution ."
13868,"However , hedge funds would n't approve the model ."
13869,They executed a hedge trading strategy of creating two long positions : simultaneously long in Dow Jones and oil .
13870,"Their logic was that if oil prices fell , the US economy would prosper and the Dow Jones stocks would rise , the absolute value of which should be greater than the fall of oil prices ;"
13871,"if oil prices rise , Dow Jones , which represented a production model that is the US 's most competitive and best able to overcome high oil prices , should fall at an absolute value smaller than the rise in oil prices ."
13872,This should be an always profitable hedge trading strategy -LRB- specific trading profits depend on the hedge ratio between Dow Jones and oil -RRB- .
13873,It 's already the most dangerous third day into the Great Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan .
13874,"As of now , the officially confirmed death toll has exceeded 15,000 ."
13875,A great number of brothers and sisters are still buried under the debris or trapped in a dangerous situation .
13876,"Under the leadership and organization of the Party and the government , the entire nation are doing all they can in a concert effort to save their compatriots in disaster - hit areas ."
13877,Governments of different countries and their people are also extending humane care in various ways .
13878,"As China 's first and only full real - name blog site to date , blshe.com promptly issued an urgent initiative following the earthquake that asked on people to take part in earthquake fighting and disaster rescue through blogs ."
13879,"Later , in conjunction with 10 major domestic blogging platforms including people.com.cn and joining hands with the Chinese Red Cross Society , it called on netizens and bloggers globally to donate ."
13880,These initiatives are positively responded to .
13881,"Blshe.com has not only become a key platform that publishes in real - time front - line stories about earthquake fighting and disaster rescue , it has also turned into a channel to raise money for disaster - hit areas ."
13882,The vast number of bloggers have donated either in their own name or within the framework of their local blogger associations .
13883,"Some have also helped disaster - hit areas contact donation targets and donating organizations , fully demonstrating their valuable consciousness to shoulder morality and righteousness ."
13884,Devastating Critique of the Arab World by One of Its Own
13885,Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing this along via e-mail .
13886,It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation .
13887,It 's a long but very worthwhile read .
13888,`` A View from the Eye of the Storm ''
13889,"Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation , April , 2004 :"
13890,"`` As you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological `` entertainment '' in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come ."
13891,I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
13892,"My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years ."
13893,"You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country ."
13894,I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
13895,"However , I will touch upon it only in passing ."
13896,I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
13897,"I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non-Arab and also significant non-Moslem minorities ."
13898,Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
13899,"Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region ."
13900,"Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict ,"
13901,but it is not where the main show is .
13902,The millions who died in the Iran - Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel .
13903,"The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel ."
13904,The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
13905,"Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel ."
13906,Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60's because of Israel .
13907,Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
13908,The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel .
13909,"The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on ."
13910,"The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years ."
13911,"The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion ."
13912,They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
13913,"These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone ."
13914,"Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief"
13915,"and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers ."
13916,The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
13917,"Human rights are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission ."
13918,"According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N. , the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates ."
13919,The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
13920,"Birth rates in the region are very high , increasing the poverty , the social gaps and the cultural decline ."
13921,"And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world ."
13922,"It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline ."
13923,"It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves ."
13924,"A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families :"
13925,"They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional ."
13926,"The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others ."
13927,"Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong , but are afraid to express their views ."
13928,"The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region ."
13929,"A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War ,"
13930,but we are already well into it .
13931,"These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as `` the undeclared World War III '' : against it . They become accomplices , by omission , and this applies to"
13932,*1 .
13933,Suicide murders are not a new invention
13934,"but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately ."
13935,"Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon ."
13936,It is a very potent psychological weapon .
13937,Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
13938,The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
13939,September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
13940,More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
13941,Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
13942,So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?
13943,It creates headlines .
13944,It is spectacular .
13945,It is frightening .
13946,It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
13947,It is always shown on television in great detail .
13948,"One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey ."
13949,But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
13950,This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .
13951,"The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one ."
13952,We may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
13953,"But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people ."
13954,Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?
13955,How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?
13956,Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses .
13957,"Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals ."
13958,Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards
13959,"and this line will be the target , not to speak of killing the guards themselves ."
13960,You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
13961,And it is a war !
13962,What is behind the suicide murders ?
13963,"Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else ."
13964,It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
13965,No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .
13966,No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
13967,No relative of anyone influential has done it .
13968,"Would n't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?"
13969,Are n't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
13970,"Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads ."
13971,"They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead ."
13972,Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .
13973,"The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa ."
13974,It never happens there .
13975,"There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents ."
13976,"Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation ."
13977,"There was certainly more despair in Saddam 's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer 's Iraq ,"
13978,and no one exploded himself .
13979,"A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power ."
13980,The only way to fight this new `` popular '' weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way .
13981,"Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid ."
13982,You can not eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .
13983,You must go after the head of the `` Family '' .
13984,"If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism ."
13985,"The United States understands this now , after September 11 ."
13986,Russia is beginning to understand it .
13987,Turkey understands it well .
13988,I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
13989,"Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way ."
13990,"In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen ."
13991,The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
13992,The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable .
13993,"Until Europe wakes up , this unity will not be achieved ."
13994,*2 .
13995,Words can be lethal .
13996,They kill people .
13997,"It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life ."
13998,"But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about ."
13999,"An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot ."
14000,"You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad ."
14001,Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic .
14002,"But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statements , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region ."
14003,"Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester ,"
14004,but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
14005,"It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars ."
14006,"After all , if you want to be an anti-Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it ."
14007,"You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed ."
14008,But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .
14009,"When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true ."
14010,"It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them ."
14011,It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
14012,"Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything ."
14013,"Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs ,"
14014,and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
14015,"I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time ."
14016,You will not believe your own eyes .
14017,"But words also work in other ways , more subtle ."
14018,"A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam 's regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a `` peace demonstration '' ."
14019,"You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much ."
14020,"A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill ."
14021,"She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant ."
14022,She is called `` martyr '' by several Arab leaders and `` activist '' by the European press .
14023,Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
14024,There is a new game in town :
14025,"The actual murderer is called `` the military wing '' ,"
14026,"the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called `` the political wing ''"
14027,and the head of the operation is called the `` spiritual leader '' .
14028,"There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media ."
14029,These words are much more dangerous than many people realize .
14030,They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
14031,"It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it ."
14032,He is now being outperformed by his successors .
14033,*3 .
14034,"Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder ."
14035,In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .
14036,"The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets ."
14037,"The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes ."
14038,"These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors ."
14039,"They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure ."
14040,"Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance ."
14041,"This circle operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media ."
14042,"It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal ."
14043,"It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region ."
14044,"The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle ."
14045,"The Saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle ."
14046,"The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle ."
14047,"Figuratively speaking , this outer circle is the guardian , which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside ."
14048,"Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles ."
14049,The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .
14050,"Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred ."
14051,Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
14052,"You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers ."
14053,"The Jihad `` soldiers '' join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland ."
14054,"Mrs. Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al-Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level ."
14055,*4 .
14056,"The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties ."
14057,"There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs ."
14058,"Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now ."
14059,Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
14060,Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations .
14061,Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him ?
14062,Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers ?
14063,Does free speech protect you when you shout `` fire '' in a crowded theater ?
14064,"Should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murders ?"
14065,These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
14066,But now we have an entire new set .
14067,"Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?"
14068,"Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?"
14069,Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?
14070,Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
14071,Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
14072,"Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?"
14073,"Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?"
14074,"Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?"
14075,All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
14076,What do you do ?
14077,"Well , you do not want to face the dilemma ."
14078,But it can not be avoided .
14079,"Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary ."
14080,"I leave it to you as homework to figur out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation ."
14081,The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
14082,It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
14083,"In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society ."
14084,"International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and can not be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government ."
14085,"International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him ."
14086,"The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as `` war criminals , '' with some Western media repeating the allegations ."
14087,"The good news is that all of this is temporary ,"
14088,because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
14089,"The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after ."
14090,"After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one ."
14091,"But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done ."
14092,The picture I described here is not pretty .
14093,What can we do about it ?
14094,"In the short run , only fight and win ."
14095,"In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world ."
14096,The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .
14097,The outer circle can not be eliminated by force .
14098,"Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter-propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene ."
14099,"Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil ."
14100,"Allow me , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science ."
14101,"When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically ."
14102,"You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new `` supplies '' from expanding the tumor ."
14103,"If you want to be sure , it is best to do both ."
14104,"But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years ."
14105,"In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people ."
14106,"I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument , but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia ."
14107,"Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony ."
14108,Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list .
14109,"As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them ."
14110,"Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union ."
14111,"Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel ."
14112,This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
14113,It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
14114,"I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation ."
14115,"In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime ."
14116,It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
14117,It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
14118,It is ruthless .
14119,"It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies ."
14120,It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
14121,Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the `` good - cop versus bad - cop '' game .
14122,"Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism ,"
14123,"it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq ,"
14124,"it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ;"
14125,it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia
14126,"and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq ."
14127,"Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals ."
14128,In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
14129,"It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises ."
14130,"When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully ."
14131,"It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror ."
14132,"It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism ."
14133,"It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance ."
14134,"Above all , never surrender to terror ."
14135,"No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier ."
14136,But it really does not matter .
14137,What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .
14138,"The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq ."
14139,"In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more ."
14140,Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?
14141,"If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution ."
14142,"If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory ."
14143,"We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey ."
14144,"It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully ."
14145,"On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China ."
14146,I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
14147,"But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be ."
14148,"Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn ."
14149,"I 'm leaving , Captain ,"
14150,I must go
14151,There 's blood upon your hand
14152,"But tell me , Captain , if you know Of a decent place to stand - Leonard Cohen"
14153,Only time right now for some quick thoughts on Haditha .
14154,"Or rather , Haditha 's elevation as Iraq 's official , bad apple atrocity ."
14155,"Even for those who try to pay attention to what filters through the fog of war crimes , these things tend to run together ."
14156,"Haditha is n't Abu Sifa where , according to Iraqi police , US forces '' on a rampage '' executed a family of 11 , then bombed their house , burned their cars and slaughtered their animals ."
14157,"What more will we hear of Abu Sifa , now Haditha has become the representative and inevitable example of honour 's exception ?"
14158,"Because along with Haditha comes Jesse Macbeth , allegedly a former Army Ranger and Iraq war veteran , whose claims that massacre was method rather than madness rapidly went viral on the Net ."
14159,"His story was unsubstantiated and exteme , yet plausible because it was extreme , and provided a template to the pattern of force on exhibit in Iraq ."
14160,A pattern rarely admitted by the West 's institutional media .
14161,"But Macbeth , it now appears , is the Pentagon 's timely strawman to buttress its case for Haditha 's exceptionalism , and to discredit influential anti-war voices such as Iraq Veterans Against the War ."
14162,"Whether unaware or not of his status as a COINTELPRO asset , it does n't matter ,"
14163,"because regardless , Macbeth became a lucky charm for those who refuse to believe the program of horror in which US troops are engaged ,"
14164,and there are many .

14241,"The Anonymous at 2:52 PM , albeit lobotomized by the iron triangle 's propaganda , hit upon a major point we should all be aware of ."
14242,"Iraq , or Iran for that matter , are just foreplay ."
14243,The real act occurs when the Empire takes on China .
14244,The only way an industrial power can take on another with ten times its population base is by using what it thinks is its overwhelming advantage .
14245,"That would be a massive nuclear strike , incincerating all opposition before it could mobilize , and using its new warfighter technology to mop up everything else ."
14246,"In the long run , it may be that the Middle Eastern conflagrations are designed to harden the American people to the inevitability of genocide ."
14247,Not that it really is inevitable : but it would make ruling a whole lot easier for a government controlled by the military front of the world 's largest private equity firm .
14248,"'' .. when the police state crushes HIS family , .. ''"
14249,The problem with that catchy idea is that the participants of empire are mostly assured they have a safe haven *when* the bottom falls out or assume they do more so than smuks like me or you .
14250,Let 's face it :
14251,Money buys some security ;
14252,"a lot of money buys a lot of security ,"
14253,and those that have access to it KNOW what 's going on and have made plans accordingly .
14254,Unfortunately anon 2:52 is n't that far off in Twilight Zone kind of way -
14255,"although I do not agree with h / hr ethic morality , there are too many people on earth RIGHT NOW ,"
14256,"that is , if they ALL WANT to have a car and drive to the mall - and a lot of them are waking up to that idea , which , as it stands now , is impossible ."
14257,"His nonchelant benign God force mannerism is appalling and is apparent in the Neo-Con World of the Project for a New American Century , which if I 'm not mistaken , did address the issues of exactly what is being said here ."

14265,A Breakdown in Thinking
14266,Posted by Butler Shaffer at 12:53 PM
14267,"News reports inform us that American military officials are now convinced that a unit of Marines killed some 24 unarmed Iraqis , including women and six children ."
14268,Some of the victims had been shot `` execution style . ''
14269,One government official stated that this atrocity showed `` a total breakdown in morality . ''
14270,"What on earth do these officials think all war is , if not a `` breakdown in morality ? ''"
14271,"If the systematic slaughter of tens or hundreds of thousands of human beings does n't represent a `` breakdown in morality , '' what does ?"
14272,"Do we have to wait for some major offense , such as illicit sex in the oval office ?"
14273,I would go even further than this :
14274,`` war is the mobilization of immorality . ''
14275,Would these apologists for such killings have been satisfied if the same deaths to the same innocents had been brought about by aerial bombs ?
14276,I am reminded of a distinction one of my students tried making a few years ago in contrasting suicide bombers with militarily disciplined killing :
14277,"`` at least we have the decency to drop bombs from airplanes , '' he declared ."
14278,I wonder what kind of spin the twits at Faux News are putting on this for their audience of the bloodthirsty !
14279,"On this Memorial Day weekend , it would be worthwhile for Americans - whose government is running this abattoir - to recognize the immorality of their support for such madness ."
14280,"Those who wave their flags , or emblazon their cars with `` support the troops '' messages , are as much to blame for this so - called `` breakdown in morality '' as anyone else ."
14281,"Out of a sense of moral decency , this weekend might be an appropriate occasion to remove such symbols from their cars , homes , and - better yet - their minds !"
14282,"Question : did U.S. troops in WW2 shoot children while their mothers tried to shield them , screaming for mercy ?"
14283,"Remember Maggot , the Telly Savalas rapist - character from `` The Dirty Dozen ? ''"
14284,Jim Brown machine - gunned him for messing with a German woman in a simple act of field justice .
14285,That sort of moral action seemed fairly unremarkable to people back then .
14286,"Fast - forward to today 's GI : innured to violence by a lifetime of ultra-violent `` Kill Bill '' movies , ultra-violent FPS video games , he has become the thing an earlier generation was taught was most detestable : a nazi storm trooper , a self - appointed SS death 's - head executioner ."
14287,"Bereft of any sense of the sacred , he shoots little girls without compunction ."
14288,"He is , quite literally , insane , a `` Natural Born Killer . ''"
14289,"These atavistic carrion - birds surely will come home to roost ,"
14290,and one thing seems undeniable :
14291,it 's not going to be pretty when they do .
14292,I do n't just mean the troops returning from Iraq : I mean the whole malevolent Culture of Death .
14293,Go for a drive in any U.S. city
14294,and witness the seething hatred Americans have for each other .
14295,"`` Your streets will be smeared with blood , '' as the prophecy has it ."
14296,"A society built on lies , where respect for human life is absent , where every media outlet mirrors the bloodlust , is a society doomed ."
14297,"`` And what rough beast , its hour come round at last ? ''"
14298,Iraq has been a training ground .
14299,Sane people come home scarred for life from such a place .
14300,The real psychopaths graduate to high paying private security contractor jobs and are destined to become the Praetorian Guard for the New World Order .
14301,"On that last video game piece , I just posted a comment , referring to a serial killer toy set ."
14302,And an article about it .
14303,the article was written 17 years ago about a kid who was not yet near puberty .
14304,Kind of Bart or Lisa 's age back in the days of the original simpsons .
14305,"The kid who bought that toy would be in their mid to late 20s right now , possibly with a tour or two of Iraq under their belts ."
14306,"It 's not the `` Kill Bills '' or the video games that cause this bullshit , not even serial killer toys ."
14307,It 's the lack of true culture and connection to anything that really fucks things up .
14308,It 's not the movies ... or the games .
14309,That is it .
14310,"After all , ALL life is sacred ."
14311,Or none .
14312,there is no middle ground .

14314,things die for me to live .
14315,The life they had is sacred too . -RRB-
14316,To all of you who have never been in a war ....
14317,there is no morality in war . ''
14318,I heard a WW2 vet say this tonight .
14319,Could n't agree more .
14320,It 's one good reason why wars should be last resorts instead of the cool graphics embellished infotainment spectacles that they are .
14321,It 's also why the ultimate responsibility for this lies at Washington 's doorstep .
14322,"& , ultimately , at our doorsteps ."
14323,Washington sold us a bill of goods
14324,& we were too damn lazy to uncover the bill of goods .
14325,"Hell , I bet more Americans do more research to buy a f*cking clothes dryer than they did before they bought this war , hook line & sinker ."
14326,"Of course , a lot of Americans have flip flopped over to the against column ."
14327,I just hope they do n't try to scapegoat these boys for acting badly in reeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaal goddamn bad situation that WE sent them into .
14328,& I do mean WE .
14329,"I thought this was a bad idea from the start ,"
14330,but what did I do to stop it ?
14331,"Wrote my representatives & garnered a collection of condescending form `` You just do n't understand the situation '' letters in return , signed a couple of petitions marched in a march ......."
14332,woo - fucking - woo .
14333,"In other words , I did n't do shit ."
14334,"But then , neither did anyone else ."
14335,You do n't have to be drunk to cause a car accident .
14336,"When Roman soldiers asked John the baptist how should they prepare themselves for this Messiah in the book of Luke , John responded , '' Do not terrify men with a view to extortion , neither accuse anyone falsely ;"
14337,and be content with your wages .
14338,For an excellent exposure of Chinese Communism go to www.ninecommentaries.com
14339,The following four paragraphs are taken from this website .
14340,For the Chinese Communists killing is also necessary for practical reasons .
14341,The Communist Party began as a group of thugs and scoundrels who killed to obtain power .
14342,"Once this precedent was set , there was no going back ."
14343,"Constant terror was needed to intimidate people and force them to accept , out of fear , the absolute rule of the Chinese Communist Party ."
14344,"In a normal society , people show care and love for one another , hold life in awe and veneration and give thanks to God ."
14345,"In the East , people say , `` Do not impose on others what you would not want do to yourself . ''"
14346,"In the West , people say , `` Love thy neighbor as thyself . ''"
14347,"Conversely , the CCP holds that `` The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles . ''"
14348,"In order to keep alive the `` struggles '' within society , hatred must be generated ."
14349,"Not only does the CCP take lives , it encourages people to kill each other ."
14350,It strives to desensitize people towards others ' suffering by surrounding them with constant killing .
14351,"It wants them to become numb from frequent exposure to inhumane brutality , and develop the mentality that `` the best you can hope for is to avoid being persecuted . ''"
14352,All these lessons taught by brutal suppression enable the CCP to maintain its rule .
14353,"In addition to the destruction of countless lives , the CCP also destroyed the soul of the Chinese people ."
14354,A great many people have become conditioned to react to the CCP 's threats by entirely surrendering their reason and their principles .
14355,"In a sense , these people 's souls have died - something more frightening than physical death ."
14356,"Back in 1903 , Yale Divinity School established a number of schools and hospitals throughout China that were collectively known as ' Yale in China . '"
14357,One of ' Yale in China 's ' most important students was Mao Zedong .
14358,"During World War II , ' Yale in China ' was a primary instrument used by the U.S. Establishment and its Office of Strategic Services -LRB- OSS -RRB- to install the Maoists into power ."
14359,"' Yale in China ' was run by OSS operative Reuben Holden , the husband of Bush 's cousin , and also a member of the Skull and Bones ."
14360,"`` Yale in China '' was also closely associated with the New York - based Union Theological Seminary , which has been a center for U.S. subversion of Asia ."
14361,`` The Maoists made China into the world 's largest opium producer . ''
14362,"According to Kathy Griggs , this revolutionary terrorist group is controlling the Marines and Army ."
14363,They all operate together .
14364,"They actually promoted communists in the OSS , which was started by William Donovan ."
14365,"So they promote and use communists , who actually want to get rid of the form of U.S. government as a stepping stone to world domination ."
14366,"So this group , now , in the Army and Marine Corp. has communists at the very top ."
14367,"One example of this truth is the goings on at Abu Ghraib U.S. Military Prison , which is located twenty miles west of Baghdad ."
14368,A large percent of prisoners there have not commited any criminal acts agaisnt the coalition .
14369,The military has a policy of `` random sweeps '' whenever the base is under attack .
14370,They gather all men in the area between the ages 17 for questioning to Abu Ghraib Prison .
14371,After finding out the men 's innocence they are slated for release .
14372,But because of military bureaucracy this can be as long as one year .
14373,General Kapinski states in the `` Taguba Report '' Section 24 -LRB- U -RRB- that as many as 60 percent of Abu Ghraib prisoners are not guilty of any crimes committed agaisnt the coalition .
14374,The release of these innocent prisoners was denied by General Majowski 2nd in command in Iraq .
14375,On the internet type Iraq : Beyond Abu Ghraib : Detention and torture in Iraq .
14376,This is the Amnesty International Report .
14377,Also the February 2004 International Red Cross Report Section 7 which states that 70 to 90 percent of all prisoners held at Abu Ghraib were innocent .
14378,"To announce that there must be no criticism of the president , or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong , is not only unpatriotic , and servile , but is morally treasonable to the American public ."
14379,- Theodore Roosevelt -
14380,Perhaps the whole reason Mao did his thing was because he was against what he learnt from `` Yale in China '' .
14381,Perhaps he was trying to destroy the influence of a group he felt were trying to rule the world .
14382,Just a thought .
14383,"Probably wrong , but maybe not ."
14384,One practical result of Mao was the cultural revolution .
14385,This probably severed the Chinese zeitgeist from its cultural and spiritual base .
14386,"Its 's easier to commit atrocities in the name of power in this way IMO , well easier to motivate others to do it for you ."
14387,Disconnection from the source .
14388,Yet again .
14389,`` A pattern rarely admitted by the West 's institutional media . ''
14390,Rarely admitted that we follow that pattern too .
14391,Its 's always others elsewhere that do that evil stuff .
14392,There seems to be a trend of this sort .
14393,"This guy -LRB- Macbeth , great name -RRB- and 911 show a similar pattern ."
14394,"There is -LRB- potentially -RRB- an ugly truth , either US military violence against civilians , or US admin complicity or responsibility for violence against its own and foreign civilians -LRB- in the WTC , Pentagon and various aircraft -RRB- ."
14395,"Extreme sensationalist claims surface that may be true -LRB- No jews died in the WTC -RRB- others events that are confirmed , like the van full of Israelis , are shown to be true and suddenly the claim seems even more plausible ."
14396,"That claim is then exposed as crap , and particularly offensive crap at that , -LRB- especially if you are related to some of the dead Jewish paople from the WTC -RRB- ."
14397,"Other amazing , hard to credit claims follow , the planes were holograms , or were n't there or whatever ."
14398,"And the money trail , or the stupidities , like the finding of a highjacker 's passport in the rubble within 12 hours of the event , or the reports of the Seattle Mayor being warned not to fly to the east coast on 911 , or the Bin ladens ' charter flight out of the US during the `` no fly '' period ; all that disappears under the weight of scorn flung at the claims that are wrong ."
14399,"Here we will show you the truth , but only in a form you can not possibly believe ."
14400,Very clever .
14401,"So instead of thousands of US soldiers snapping and killing the odd Iraqi civillian , or five . We have claims that many or all US soldiers are murdering Iraqis by the hundreds ."
14402,If that was the case there would be fuck all people left in Iraq .
14403,"Obviously crap , spoken by a nutter , anything he says or anything that comes from a similar place belongs in the same file `` batshit crazy rubbish designed to discredit us '' ."
14404,Truth is soldiers do horrible things in war .
14405,things they would probably have never thought themselves capable of .
14406,"Most western armies probably do try to moderate this , just for PR reasons and political ones ."
14407,But I bet such concerns are far from the minds of military leaders who can not be bothered to equip or supply their own troops properly .
14408,"If the army is disciplined and honourable it is designed to prevent such excesses , designed to produce fearsome perfect warriors who will kill you in a million different ways , but only if you are evil and fight them ."
14409,"Pity those armies only exist in niave children 's imaginations , or fantasy novels set in mythical worlds ."
14410,All this babbling here will remedy nothing .
14411,Ask God 's forgiveness .
14412,Get out while you can .
14413,"Revelation 18 : 18:1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven , having great power ;"
14414,and the earth was lightened with his glory .
14415,"18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice , saying , Babylon the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird ."
14416,"18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication ,"
14417,"and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her ,"
14418,and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
14419,"18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues ."
14420,"18:5 For her sins have reached unto heaven , and God hath remembered her iniquities ."
14421,Here we go again ...
14422,Remember : there is no conspiracy .
14423,"Let 's go over this article slowly , shall we ?"
14424,"First of all , every war has its share of atrocities and massacres , on both sides ."
14425,To think otherwise is to be totally naive and uninformed .
14426,"Wait , that is a good definition of the American public in general --"
14427,but that 's another story .
14428,A few examples of this .
14429,"The Boer war : first case of concentration camps , run by the British to exterminate rebels fighting against the British Empire ."
14430,WWI saw regular massacres of unarmed German soldiers who had surrendered to the allies .
14431,"WWII saw the bombing of Dresden , a target with very little military importance , and home to thousands of refugees ."
14432,Berlin was sacked and thousands of German women raped by the Red Army in 1945 .
14433,Korea witnessed several civilian massacres .
14434,"Vietnam had My Lai , and the Tiger Force ."
14435,"So , today , there are massacres in Iraq ?"
14436,The cynic in me just replies : `` And this is ... news ? '' .
14437,"Repeat after me , people :"
14438,"if dumb - as - bricks Americans did not want their precious military to be sullied by civilian massacres , they should not have given President `` W '' Bush the right to invade ."
14439,Except very few American citizens had the courage to stand and protest .
14440,"And , you mean , the army is now trying to hide the horrible , horrible fact that dozens , maybe hundreds of civilians were murdered in cold blood by US soldiers ?"
14441,And this is a conspiracy ?
14442,"Wake up , people !"
14443,"Ever since war exists -LRB- meaning : the dawn of time -RRB- , civilians have been brutalized , raped , tortured and murdered ,"
14444,and the higher - ups have covered this by saying drivel and b*llshit such as : `` We do n't torture people in America . ''
14445,-LRB- actual Presidential quote -RRB- .
14446,"Please , people , there is no conspiracy here : just a bunch of morons , realizing they have unleashed horror on innocents and trying to cover their asses ."
14447,Why do you think only lowly soldiers and no generals have been convicted ?
14448,"Because generals have the power , that 's why !"
14449,"So , one soldier stood up and talked about some razed shithole in Iraq ?"
14450,Maybe he is going overboard and creating a fancy tale of horror ?
14451,So what ?
14452,"That 's not a cover - up , that 's just some dumb -- and scarred for life -- white trash making shit up ."
14453,"Of course , the US military is going to jump at the chance to sweep the real skeletons under the carpet , so to speak ."
14454,"Business as usual , and war is good business ."
14455,"Nothing to see here , people , move along ."
14456,This is the result of more than 60 years of military conditioning .
14457,"In WWII , most of the soldiers refused to shoot at people , and shot either in the air or -- at least -- above the heads of enemy soldiers ."
14458,"In Iraq , well - conditioned army psychopaths are going to shoot at everything that moves ."
14459,You do n't like it ?
14460,"Too bad , you voted for the moron ."
14461,Twice .
14462,One last time :
14463,repugnant ?
14464,Yes .
14465,Disgusting ?
14466,Yes .
14467,Obvious ?
14468,Yes .
14469,Conspiracy ?
14470,No .
14471,It 's just the normal m.o. of the biggest military machine ever created on Earth .
14472,"Yay , USA !"
14473,Home of the psychos and Land of the militaro - industrial complex !
14474,"All praise God , and pass the ammo , we are going to smoke ourselves some Iraqis !"
14475,"All in the name of God , and freedom , and democracy , and justice , and a foetus ! -LRB- as Bill Hicks would say -RRB-"
14476,"40 years from now , more horrors , more massacres are going to be unearthed ..."
14477,"No conspiracy here , people ,"
14478,Probably just in time for the next senseless war .
14479,the dumbs leading the sheeps is more like it .
14480,Some mapmakers draw their conclusions on time and space with civil holidays spread out neatly across the spectrum .
14481,There is no `` now '' in Remembrance Day or Groundhog Day or Memorial Day or any other ICON of DAYS .
14482,Now is not the reason why we have the ICON of DAYS .
14483,Now is silent and the landscaape is mindscape is timescape is sanctified .
14484,Sure you can protest Rembembrance Day .
14485,Just do n't wear a poppy .
14486,Now that 's making a statement .
14487,"DA : speaking of `` razed shitholes in Iraq '' is employing the language of dehumanization , yes ?"
14488,"Is a razed shithole in Iraq terribly different from a razed shithole in , say , Waco , Texas ?"
14489,Please do n't forget that the Iraqis never did anything to us 'ns .
14490,"We 're the bully in their yard ,"
14491,and might makes right in the doublespeak of the fascisti .
14492,"`` Profits , not people , '' dude ."
14493,"In your little history lesson -LRB- why not go back to the Romans who slaughtered everyone in Carthage , or , for that matter , the Israelites in the OT , commanded by Yawheh to slaughter man , women , and child ? -RRB- , you mention the bombing of Dresden ."
14494,"I 'll toss in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ,"
14495,"but those pilot - murderers were at one remove from the slaughter they were , uh , enabling :"
14496,they did n't have to look at the mother trying to shield her kids before pulling the trigger .
14497,"Obviously , the pilots did n't think too much about what was happening on the ground , or they would lose their minds -LRB- their souls had already been burned away , whether they knew it or not -RRB- ."
14498,"I 'm sure there were GIs shooting innocents in WW2 ,"
14499,"but that kind of atrocity is not emblamatic of the war , in the way that napalm drops and tiger teams are emblamatic of Vietnam , and Fallujah and Abu Graib and Hadifa will be emblamatic of Iraq ."
14500,Denying the effects of violent culture is denying the effects of operant conditioning .
14501,"Yes , at the root of our monstrous age is the loss of any sense of the sacred , or , more specifically , the acute sense that humans are created in the image of God and that God is very much real and keeping notes ,"
14502,but surely one step towards rediscovering human dignity is acknowledging that culture matters .
14503,"No one `` turns off the tv '' before first realizing that tv is unhealthy -LRB- Jerry Mander 's book is brilliant in this regard -RRB- , just as no one will `` avert their eyes from the Imperium '' without realizing that Empire - worship is nothing but Moloch - worship ."
14504,Moloch ?
14505,Indeed .
14506,"As Mother Teresa put it , `` If we accept that a mother can kill even her own child , how can we tell people not to kill one another ?"
14507,"Any country that accepts abortion , is not teaching its people to love , but to use any violence to get what it wants . ''"
14508,Ouch !
14509,Religiosity !
14510,"But most certainly the U.S. is `` using any violence to get what it wants , '' and has been for a long time ."
14511,"Hey , the undead like Cal Thomas say , `` it 's the cost of freedom . ''"
14512,Freedom to do what -- obey ?
14513,"I like Edward Abbey 's quote -LRB- and we miss you , Ed -RRB- :"

14641,Phobias occur in both genders in the ages ranging between twenty and thirty years old ; they very rarely occur in adolescents .
14642,"Also , no cases have been recorded among children ; they rarely occur in children ."
14643,"Nervous phobias usually happen at night , with the patient waking up with fast and pounding heartbeats , and feeling as if he were suffering a heart attack because of the chest pains , profuse sweating , and abnormal heart activity that accompanies fear and strong panic attacks ."
14644,The most common kind of phobia is the fear of high places and areas -LRB- Acrophobia -RRB- .
14645,Fear of heights is the most common type of phobia .
14646,A patient could be subject to losing his balance and then falling .
14647,"So any healthy person is advised not to insist that an acrophobic accompany him to high places , as he does not feel the extent of his pain and emotion , and both might get hurt ."
14648,"Airplanes , in addition to skyscrapers , are among the causes of this phobia , as well as high rides in amusement parks , mountains and roads overlooking slopes or bridges ."
14649,A person does not necessarily have to be in a high place to experience the symptoms of this phobia .
14650,"It is enough for him to see , for example , a skyscraper to immediately have the symptoms , even if he is safe on the ground ."
14651,"We had never seen , we had never experienced , we had never read of , and we had never heard of a Saudi , whether secular or liberal , modernized or enlightened , or even a communist or atheist , who writes and deals with ideas , whether he is young or old ."
14652,"We never heard about any of those who confronted the state or carried a rifle and a bomb and adopted the policy of bombing and terrorism to change the status of the state , or acted barbarically and broke his pen to carry a stick instead , and confined the thoughts of others with it in order to lead a change by his hand , instead of by his ideas ."
14653,"The Islamic movement does not lack ideas to confront others , if it is truly honest in adopting angelic Islamic thoughts ."
14654,"Besides , it is shameful and wrong to describe an Islamic movement as an empty cart causing noise , or to say that its mind is so narrow that its tongue expanded ."
14655,The issue is bigger than this .
14656,That is why we have a right to ask : Why then did the minds of those people go astray ?
14657,"Here I do not favor one movement over another , rather I describe reality , and bring it to our collective memory , so it can be a witness against those people ."
14658,"The truth , which we should not ignore , and which answers that question , indicates that their ambition goes beyond denying the reprehensible , having correct beliefs , and preaching the only sect - it goes much beyond that ."
14659,"In short , their goal is the seat of power , to which they want to appoint their caliph someday ."
14660,"In short , their goal is to return to the Islamic caliphate , which is their dearest and most precious wish ."
14661,"That means , in any case , the destruction of Al Saud dynasty as a start , then electing one of their sheikhs to be the awaited caliph ."
14662,The Muslims in their early history did not designate a day to lay work aside .
14663,"This is why some scholars considered taking Friday off a kind of imitation of the unbelievers , because they are accustomed to leaving work on their weekly holiday , like Saturday for Jews and Sunday for Christians ."
14664,"It has become common in the Islamic world to take off from official and semi-official work , such as in companies , on Friday ."
14665,The excuse for taking off on Friday was that one would be free for Friday prayers .
14666,"That is why it has become an acceptable custom , and this distances it from the comparison that Friday is the Muslims ' weekly holiday ."
14667,God guided this community to this day and led it away from Jews and Christians .
14668,"Jews have Saturday , and Christians have Sunday ."
14669,"But when the imitation sickness intensified in the Islamic community , their ways of taking on the attitudes of unbelieving people diversified ."
14670,"Some of them made the weekend Saturday and Sunday , like Jewish and Christian countries ."
14671,This is the ugliest type of imitation in this matter .
14672,And some of them made the weekend Friday and Saturday .
14673,I do not think anyone made the weekend three days .
14674,"And some of them were satisfied to imitate the number of days of the weekend , so they made the week 's holiday on Thursday and Friday ."
14675,This is the lesser evil among them .
14676,"There are many evils in long holidays ; this is not the place for detailing them , and God knows better ."
14677,"Peace be upon our Prophet Mohamed , his family , and companions ."
14678,"Over a month ago , the experienced Iraqi politician Adnan Pachachi doubted Prime Minister Nouri Al - Malaki 's ability to carry out his promise to disband the armed militias and disarm them and said that Al - Maliki was in one corner and his government ministers , whether Shiites from the Al - Sadr movement and Al - Hakim 's group or Sunnis , were in another corner in terms of their allegiance to parties that have armed militias ."
14679,"In fact , Pachachi 's conclusions are nothing new for the Iraqi situation that has reached the edge of a bottomless pit because of these militias whose existence the Iraqi man on the street can no longer tolerate as they have turned his life into a hell worse than the fire of Saddam 's Fedayeen and the bloody Hunin apparatus during the first chapter of dictatorship in the land of Mesopotamia ."
14680,"And while Al - Maliki reached a new level of confrontation in his attack in parliament a few days ago when he denounced those he called "" politicians during the day and pro-Saddam militias and terrorists at night , "" Diri Al - Sadri who escaped an American raid to capture him is still active , and openly so , in his stronghold in Al - Sadr city some of whose residents boasted in a statement reported by the London newspaper Al - Hayat of what they called Abu Diri 's relations with officials who visit in order to get close to him ."
14681,"Ali Al - Bideri said with pride , "" Our area has become notorious and is being constantly visited by senior state officials who seek Abu Diri 's approval and pledge their obedience ."
14682,"This has made people flock to his house in search of his mediation with them to empoy their unemployed children . """
14683,"These visits , according to this proud citizen , Al - Bideri "" are not just by Iraqi state officials but also by foreigners from an Islamic state "" which is , of course , Iran ."
14684,"The Western man , when he sits and listens to news reports or political or controversial speeches , he submits the information to his mental kitchen or what is called feedback in order to be able to draw out the essence and truth from it and to relegate embellishments to oblivion , or ignorance and ridicule ,"
14685,"These are catchphrase lies or , if we want to be honest , the mental demeaning of the intellect of the listener or recipient of the information ."
14686,This is what differentiates the western man from the eastern man who has gotten used to not exerting his mind and using his mind with analysis and critique .
14687,"Given that he lives in a consumer society , he has no productive capacity left ,"
14688,why would he use the productive capacity bestowed on him by God ?
14689,And indeed he does not possess any production incentives .
14690,"He carries what he is programmed to memorize and he repeats , and on many occasions he does not understand ."
14691,This is the paradox between a productive society exemplified by the West and the consumer society represented by the East .
14692,And this is what has led both enemies and friends to call on psychologists and philosophers to formulate the slogan so that it is compatible with emotion and possesses the power to pierce the heart without exhausting the mind .
14693,"Based on this , we have reached the state in which we now live , in the midst of stagnation , bearing its load ."
14694,Xu Xin also has a set of unique and secret standards for selecting people .
14695,"First , check if the entrepreneur has "" business intuition . """
14696,"When Xu Xin first invested in Ding Lei of Netease , he was the first one to enter the SMS business and the first one to develop online games ."
14697,He could see the business opportunities that others failed to see .
14698,He could persist while others gave it up .
14699,He could retreat when all the others moved forward with the trend .
14700,"Second , what achievements the team has made and what major decisions it has gone through ."
14701,"Third , the ability to lead a team , whether the entrepreneur has personal charisma and knows how to manage personnel ."
14702,"With 10 people under him , the leader was still capable of management ."
14703,"When the company expanded to 100 people , the leader was unable to manage and became a bottleneck instead ."
14704,"To investigate this , Xu Xin would listen to the comments from his competitors and would observe his assistant ."
14705,"If the assistant was very competent , and had followed him many years , this shows the leadership of this person is not bad ."
14706,"Fourth , passion is a must ."
14707,Passion means the love for the enterprise .
14708,The process of starting a business is always very tedious and difficult .
14709,"Without this passion , it is very hard to persevere nor stand out among millions of entrepreneurs ."
14710,"Fifth , the character of the entrepreneur must be open , transparent , honest , and reliable ."
14711,"With so much money handed over to him for management , could this not be taken into consideration ?"
14712,"After the establishment of new China , and in view of the two facets of the Chinese national bourgeoisie , who exploiting the workers to make a profit on one hand , and supporting the constitution as well as accepting socialist transformation on the other , the Chinese Communist Party formulated a policy to use , restrict , and transform capitalist industries and businesses ,"
14713,"Through a series of transitional forms for state capitalism , ranging from low to high levels , and after taking into consideration China 's national conditions , the Party implemented "" peaceful redemption "" on capitalist owned means of production based on the visions of Marx and Lenin ."
14714,"Through "" buying , "" the majority of these people were transformed into independent laborers ,"
14715,"We have bought off a social class , and eliminated a private ownership system ,"
14716,A basic system of socialism was established in China .
14717,"A whole society showed a economic development upsurge centered on the "" public "" ,"
14718,"The voice proclaiming that "" we are not only good at destroying the old world , but also will excel in building a new world "" was a most heroic one in those days ."
14719,"If you have money , there 's no need to talk about it ."
14720,"But among the working class , if a couple 's basic monthly salary was greater by just one thousand or so , the pressure from a mortgage would definitely be a lot less ."
14721,"In addition , mortgage procedures are becoming increasingly simple and the conditions are also favorable ."
14722,"Of course , this means to push up housing prices ."
14723,My parents have discussed with me whether they should quickly haul out their savings to buy a house .
14724,"It 's because my mother says that money is becoming more worthless over the time , especially for the working class like them whose primary income is the salary ."
14725,My parents have a few properties and have only rented out one house for business use .
14726,"Nowadays , the rent one gets by renting out a house is not high either , so they are n't expecting to earn much from the rent , but rather are hoping the properties will maintain their value ."
14727,"If they want to buy another property now , they will definitely have to borrow from the bank ."
14728,I think perhaps they should wait until next year when housing prices tumble .
14729,Then it will be relatively worthwhile .
14730,Does anybody think that housing prices could fall next year ?
14731,"Chinese - Canadian Member of Parliament Michael Chong resigned without hesitation from his position as a cabinet minister in the federal government because of a parliamentary vote on a bill regarding "" Quebec as a single nation within the Canada territory "" ,"
14732,"On the 28th , the Chinese community and Chinese in the Conservative Party all praised his commitment to justice and principle as well as his morality , courage and demeanor in voicing his own viewpoint ."
14733,""" I will not compromise on this principle , not now , and nor in the future . """
14734,Michael Chong reckoned that a nation can not exist inside another nation -LRB- nation within nation -RRB- and that there should only be one country named Canada .

14738,"Chinese - Canadian Civic Alliance Vice - President Dr. Huang Weizhong said that between political correctness and the principles of justice , Michael Chong 's choice to resign serves as a model for the Canadian political world ."
14739,It also communicates the orientation of the values of the Chinese community .
14740,His resignation is not the result of a single incident .
14741,"Besides the Quebec issue being the direct cause , Michael Chong 's difference in opinion from that of the prime minister regarding the handling of Canadian - Chinese relations could also have been a cause ."
14742,"I was not selected , I needed money , but unfortunately I did n't get this part - time job ."
14743,I was n't even selected for a part - time job of just eating instant noodles .
14744,"She was not selected , poor her , it seems that her boyfriend would be snatched away by Yun ."
14745,"On the stage , he would be Romeo , and Yun would be Juliet , the leading actress of the Chinese department ."
14746,"She had to sit in front of the stage , looking at him and Yun to play out the vicissitudes of life and the sorrow of lingering ."
14747,"She would not resign to , I needed money ,"
14748,"I said : Give me the money , and I will take care of that for you ."
14749,"I guarantee you would sit in front of the stage , and watch the good drama , with him ."
14750,"I got into the line once again , gazed by surrounding curious eyes ."
14751,"Because except the judges , I was the only female there ."
14752,I was the only female competing with so many guys for acting the role of Romeo .
14753,"I had already lost one part - time job , I could not lose the second one ."
14754,"I was so desperate , acting out Romeo 's struggle before he stabbed himself with a dagger , calling out in my heart : money , money , money , though what came out of my mouth was Juliet 's name ."
14755,"Same desperation , same helplessness ."
