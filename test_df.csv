1,"To express its determination , the Chinese securities regulatory department compares this stock reform to a die that has been cast ."
2,"It takes time to prove whether the stock reform can really meet expectations , and whether any deviations that arise during the stock reform can be promptly corrected ."
3,"Dear viewers , the China News program will end here ."
4,This is Xu Li .
5,Thank you everyone for watching .
6,Coming up is the Focus Today program hosted by Wang Shilin .
7,"Good-bye , dear viewers ."
8,"Hello , dear viewers ."
9,Welcome to Focus Today .
10,"Today , let 's turn our attention to a road cave - in accident that happened in Beijing over the holiday ."
11,"Before dawn on January 3 , a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of Jingguang Bridge , East Third Ring Road , Beijing Municipality , resulting in the road caving in ."
12,Relevant departments from Beijing Municipality promptly activated emergency contingency plans .
13,The traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene .
14,"Well , how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ?"
15,"After the holiday , what will be done to handle citizens ' peak commute ?"
16,"In addition , what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge , heating , and communication , in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ?"
17,"Well , we have invited two honorable guests to the studio today to follow this topic with us ."
18,One of the two honorable guests in the studio is Professor Zhou Hanhua from the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .
19,Hello .
20,"Next is Yang Yang , a host of Beijing Traffic Radio Station ."
21,Hello .
22,Welcome both of you to the studio to participate in our program .
23,"Well , I especially want to know , ha , how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ?"
24,"Ah , , about 11:00 m. yesterday , ah , I happened to find out through an SMS when I was outside ."
25,Uh-huh .
26,Uh-huh .
27,"It happened that I was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at noon ."
28,"And then , the friend first sent me an SMS , Uh-huh . saying he would come pick me up to go together ."
29,"After that , I received an SMS from 1860 ."
30,"Uh-huh , it was through an SMS ."
31,"And you , Yang Yang ?"
32,A friend happened to call me .
33,You were not at work that day ?
34,No .
35,The station called me at noon and said something happened at Jingguang Bridge and that I had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program .
36,"Uh-huh , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station ."
37,"Right , right , right ."
38,Uh-huh .
39,"Well , like Professor Zhou , I also received this news , ha , through a mobile phone SMS ."
40,"At that time , , it can be said that this SMS was among the many , ha , SMS containing New Year wishes , like Happy New Year , received after the start of the New Year ."
41,Uh-huh .
42,"Ah , actually I felt a lot of warmth when I received that SMS ."
43,"Although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much , I think it is very useful , ah , to inform people of this kind of news ."
44,"Yes , exceptionally ."
45,"Yes , exceptionally ."
46,"Well , what in fact was the content of that SMS ?"
47,"Let 's take a look via this footage , ha ."
48,"I remember the SMS was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near Chaoyang Road , Jingguang Bridge , and East Third Ring Road , and requesting cars to make a detour ."
49,Some car owners said that it was very good that the SMS was sent .
50,"Furthermore , there was one last sentence in that SMS thanking citizens for their cooperation and support ."
51,"Ah , after the SMS was sent , , I felt it seems to be the first time that Beijing Municipality , ah , used an SMS to give notification at the time of a public emergency ."
52,"I do n't know , all of us are living in Beijing , is this the first time , Professor Zhou ?"
53,"Yes , in terms of an official notification , this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 ."
54,Uh-huh .
55,"Of course , in private life , people have used SMS countless times to spread news ."
56,Yes .
57,Other places in the country must have used this too .
58,"Uh-huh , uh-huh ."
59,Must have used this too .
60,"Actually , I remember receiving an SMS like this one last year before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in Beijing to a rather large extent ."
61,Uh-huh .
62,"However , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time ."
63,Uh-huh .
64,"Ah , when an SMS is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?"
65,"Yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by Beijing Municipality , Uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation ."
66,Uh-huh .
67,"For instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone SMS ."
68,"In fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government ."
69,We usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .
70,"Yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the Internet ."
71,Right .
72,"It seemed that computers , ah , and the Internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information ."
73,"Well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic IDs , and such as , these electronic signatures ."
74,These are quite sophisticated forms .
75,Uh-huh .
76,"In particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone SMS , are applied in e-government ."
77,"Hence , I think this is , a test of e-government because , as I remember , during SARS in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of SARS , ah ."
78,Uh-huh .
79,They said that e-government was very good but was not put into use .
80,"Well , this time I think that a short SMS like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form ."
81,Uh-huh .
82,Yes .
83,"We drive often in Beijing , ha , Yang Yang ."
84,"If people were not informed of such a traffic accident through SMS on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?"
85,Yes .
86,"Ah , well , I think it would have been real paralysis ."
87,This is the most appropriate word to use .
88,"Furthermore , I think that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well ."
89,Why is that so ?
90,"This is because , it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage ."
91,"There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically , in China , ah ."
92,"So , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement ."
93,"Yes , I noticed that many friends , around me received it ."
94,It seems that almost everyone received this SMS .
95,Yes .
96,Yes .
97,"The effect was extremely good , ha ."
98,"So , how exactly did citizens react ?"
99,Let 's take a look at the reactions of citizens .
100,-- an SMS .
101,I saw it was that Jingguang Bridge .
102,"Hey , I say , this is quite good , quite good ."
103,Have you received information like this before ?
104,"No , no ."
105,This was the first time .
106,The first time ?
107,"Yes , yes ."
108,"Well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ?"
109,Quite fast .
110,"Really quite fast , ah ."
111,"So , I did not drive today ."
112,I set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .
113,Do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?
114,"Ah , the response was quite fast ."
115,"In addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt ."
116,Colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and SMS .
117,I think this plan was quite speedy .
118,"It seems that through this kind of SMS , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha ."
119,"Well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression ."
120,Let 's find out the situation at that time through some footage .
121,"Well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes ."
122,"Well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road ."
123,"All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations ."
124,"See , through this footage , we see , ah , this --"
125,Uh-huh .
126,"Okay , ah , , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o'clock ."
127,That means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .
128,"Well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news ."
129,"Well , ah , Yang Yang , you work at Traffic Radio Station , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning ."
130,A special program .
131,"Yes , a special program on this traffic ."
132,"So , let 's first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident ."
133,"Judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?"
134,"Actually , concerning this , I think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in Beijing ."
135,"Previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in Beijing ."
136,"That is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road , it might cause the entire Third Ring Road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods ."
137,Uh-huh .
138,It might even impact traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road .
139,"Well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods ."
140,"Well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from Jingguang Bridge to Changhong Bridge from the south all the way to Guomao Bridge , blocking the main and side roads ."
141,"Well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone ."
142,"Hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried ."
143,"However , actually after the entire day today , I came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in Beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam ."
144,Uh-huh .
145,"However , the affected area was not as large as expected ."
146,"Moreover , some people made detours once they received the news ."
147,Right .
148,"Psychologically , people felt quite relieved ."
149,Because I know this situation .
150,"Right , like those whom we interviewed just now ."
151,It was easy to handle once everyone understood .
152,"Yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , I set out today before the incident , and I did not drive after I was informed ."
153,That person did not even drive .
154,Right .
155,"Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative ."
156,"For instance , this evening , we , received an SMS ."
157,"A friend said , I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge , ah ."
158,We were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .
159,"Later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the China World Trade Center ."
160,Right .
161,"Hey , he said this was quite a good idea ."
162,"Actually , I think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect ."
163,"Yes , many , viewers not in Beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred ."
164,"Ah , we can take a look later through an animation ."
165,"This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road , with problems on both the main and side roads ."
166,"Furthermore , Chaoyang Road is an intersection ."
167,Uh-huh .
168,"Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times ."
169,"Well , Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east - west direction ."
170,Yes .
171,"When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road ."
172,"Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams ."
173,"Yes , actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge ."
174,Yes .
175,"As buses that cross the Third Ring Road are currently , right now affected by the Jingguang Bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted ."
176,Uh-huh .
177,"Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes ."
178,"If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --"
179,"It is really like this , just look at the bus signs ."
180,Right .
181,Have not seen so many buses .
182,Right .
183,Its effect on people has been extremely extensive .
184,Yes .
185,Uh-huh .
186,"Well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?"
187,"Our correspondent specially interviewed Director Meng Xianlong , Mr. Meng Xianlong , of the Command Center of the Beijing Municipal Traffic Administration ."
188,Let 's hear what Director Meng said .
189,"Um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan ."
190,"In the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends ."
191,"In this way , all vehicles going along East Third Ring Road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides ."
192,East Third Ring Road is a traffic artery in the east of Beijing that links the north and the south .
193,"In order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans ."
194,"We set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along East Second Ring Road , East Fourth Ring Road , West Dawang Road , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic ."
195,It can be said that measures were very promptly taken .
196,"Ah , today is the first workday after the New Year holiday ."
197,"Well , what exactly was the situation this morning ?"
198,We specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage .
199,Let 's take a look at the situation this morning through this footage .
200,"Well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at East Third Ring Road , ah , near Guanghua Bridge , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of Jingguang Bridge have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations ."
201,"Although the outdoor temperature in Beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours ."
202,"Well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly ."
203,"Ah , it can be said , ah , Yang Yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene ."
204,Uh-huh .
205,"Right , right ."
206,", through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?"
207,"Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS ."
208,"Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work ."
209,"Therefore , they sent SMS saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus ."
210,"Well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning ."
211,We then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .
212,"This shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind ."
213,"I think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that Beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations ."
214,"On the other hand , I think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident ."
215,"That is , they think that the government has tried its best ."
216,"Well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts ."
217,Uh-huh .
218,"As such , in this regard , I think people 's mentality can become very calm ."
219,Uh-huh .
220,"Well , Professor Zhou , from this perspective , is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?"
221,Yes .
222,In terms of citizens ' mentality .
223,"Yes , in fact it can be seen from this particular case ."
224,"That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well ."
225,"We know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed ."
226,Time was lost .
227,"Well , yes , the State Council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms ."
228,"That is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do ."
229,"In this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed ."
230,"That is , in modern public management , ah , this is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people ."
231,"I think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas ."
232,"Yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic ."
233,"Traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this , cave - in accident occurred ."
234,"However , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects ."
235,Yes .
236,"Yang Yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?"
237,"Right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground ."
238,"They include those like you just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others ."
239,"Truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens ."
240,Closely linked .
241,"Yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives ."
242,Let 's take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene .
243,"Ah , according to our understanding of the situation , the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission , ah , the Communication Commission , ah , and telecommunication , traffic , and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work ."
244,"Relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people 's daily lives and work , in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period ."
245,"Well , looking at the government 's response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life ."
246,"Well , ah , Professor Zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?"
247,Yes .
248,This is also --
249,It is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .
250,"Yes , I think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries ."
251,How many groups of people will be sent ?
252,Many groups .
253,"Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society ."
254,"It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified ."
255,Uh-huh .
256,How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?
257,"Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another ."
258,"For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate ."
259,"However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role ."
260,"Hence , I think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms ."
261,Uh-huh .
262,"It was a very successful , er , response ."
263,I think many good things can be summed up from this .
264,Yes .
265,"Yang Yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?"
266,"For instance , it is very cold during winter in Beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently ."
267,"Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged ."
268,"Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing ."
269,"Well , , in this regard , the Chaoyang district government did a very good job ."
270,"After it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area ."
271,It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .
272,"Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly ."
273,"Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households ."
274,I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .
275,Uh-huh .
276,Uh-huh .
277,"Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common ."
278,Yes .
279,I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .
280,"For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents ."
281,Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .
282,This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .
283,"It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict ."
284,Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .
285,The critical thing is --
286,"But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities ."
287,Yes .
288,Yes .
289,"Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time ."
290,Right .
291,"It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone ."
292,"Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah ."
293,Yes .
294,Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .
295,"It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing ."
296,"Well , Beijing Traffic Radio Station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above ."
297,"Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans ."
298,Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .
299,"Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening ."
300,"Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked ."
301,"Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction ."
302,"It was not clear , it was very congested ."
303,You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .
304,You could find out other news only by telephone .
305,The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .
306,"Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner ."
307,"From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions ."
308,"Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city ."
309,Yes .
310,It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .
311,"Ah , apart from this , Professor Zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?"
312,"Right , I think this gave us many revelations , ah ."
313,"First , I think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts ."
314,"This is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah ."
315,Early warnings and forecasts .
316,"Yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism ."
317,Uh-huh .
318,"It is not only for , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents ."
319,Uh-huh .
320,"That is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up ."
321,Uh-huh .
322,"In this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency ."
323,Uh-huh .
324,"Another thing I want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , I think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident , responsibility system ."
325,"In fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect ."
326,"For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility ."
327,"We have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others ."
328,"That is to say , we have many corresponding systems ."
329,"However , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases ."
330,"Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability ."
331,"Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?"
332,"I think , in comparison to China , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread ."
333,Their level of development is more advanced than ours .
334,"Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries ."
335,"For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries ."
336,"With a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?"
337,"How can a safe , assured system be established ?"
338,"Well , we need to learn and manage this ."
339,Uh-huh .
340,"For instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast ."
341,"However , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility ."
342,"Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances ."
343,"Well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?"
344,"We know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test ."
345,"Well , how will they undergo testing ?"
346,These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .
347,"So , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , I think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems ."
348,"That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities ."
349,How can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?
350,"The State Council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called One Plan , Three Systems ."
351,Uh-huh .
352,""" One plan "" refers to the contingency plan , and "" three systems "" refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms , and laws ."
353,"So , I think we still have a lot of work to do in these three areas of organizations , mechanisms , and laws ."
354,Yes .
355,"Well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in Beijing ."
356,"Traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now ."
357,"Well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes ."
358,"Well , Yang Yang , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?"
359,I think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes .
360,"This is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession ."
361,"Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress ."
362,Uh-huh .
363,This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .
364,There is also an issue with many of the pipes below .
365,"Yes , the pipes below ."
366,"Right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --"
367,"Moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter ."
368,"Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster , has already been added ."
369,"But in the end , it requires time ."
370,"Hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature ."
371,"Just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline ."
372,The first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .
373,Yes .
374,"In addition , waste discharge is also very important ."
375,Waste discharged has currently blocked this up .
376,"Um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah ."
377,"Er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television ."
378,Yes .
379,"At present , we should not have a problem with watching television ."
380,They are not broken .
381,"It is just that , as the other pipes have to be repaired , the optical fibers have to be rearranged , to be hung up it seems ."
382,"After that , or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it safer to walk across this section ."
383,"Furthermore , let 's take water pipes as an example ."
384,"Because they were exposed , The water pipes were not --"
385,"after that , yes , these were not damaged ."
386,they were not damaged and this is quite normal .
387,"Um , there is no problem with water supply ."
388,"Okay , well , today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in Beijing Municipality ."
389,"At the same time , you have also analyzed , from a system perspective , how the government has reinforced emergency contingency plans to handle such public emergency cases ."
390,"Okay , thank you very much , Professor Zhou and Yang Yang , for coming to the studio to participate in our program ."
391,"Thank you , both of you ."
392,"Okay , dear viewers , that is all for today 's edition of Focus Today ."
393,Thank you for watching .
394,See you at the same time tomorrow .
395,Hello .
396,Let 's turn our attention to the weather .
397,"Today , we can use two words to summarize the weather in our country ."
398,"First , there will be a temperature drop over a large area , and next , there will be rainfall and snowfall in an extensive area as well ."
399,"We see that except for some areas of South China , Southwest China , and Northeast China , many other places will be experiencing temperature drops ."
400,"In addition , there will be snowfall in the area from Northwest China to the Huang - Huai area through southern North China ."
401,"The east of Southwest China , as well as the Jiang - Huai area and the area south of the Yangtze River , will experience continuous rainfall ."
402,"However , southern North China and the Huang - Huai area will bid farewell to the snow tonight , ah ."
403,"Tomorrow during the day , snowfall in the Jiang - Huai area will stop , and there will also be less snow in Northwest China ."
404,"In addition , there will be rain throughout almost the whole of South China ."
405,It can be said that there will be less snow in the north and heavier rain in the south tomorrow .
406,"Furthermore , temperatures tomorrow in many places south of the Huai River will fall by between four and ten degrees ."

430,Iraq in the shadows /.
431,As Iraqis vote on a new constitution have the media dropped the ball on this long and bloody war /?
432,Has Iraq been overshadowed by Katrina and Tom DeLay and Harriet Meyers and the Pakistan quake /?
433,A conversation with columnist Tom Friedman /.
434,Was Sixty Minutes unfair to Bill Clinton in airing Louis Freeh 's charges against him /?
435,Former Clinton lawyer Lanny Davis in our new Talk Back to the Media segment /.
436,Plus that bogus subway terror alert /.
437,Why did n't television slam on the brakes /?
438,Welcome to Reliable Sources /.
439,I 'm Howard Kurtz /.
440,You 're joining us at our new time ten AM eastern seven pacific for a full hour of media analysis every week /.
441,We have some new segments we 'll be adding in the coming week /.
442,so stay tuned /.
443,I had a wide ranging sitdown with Pulitzer Prize winner Tom Friedman /.
444,but first Judy Miller and the New York Times finally go public on the front page this morning with their nearly six thousand word account of the CIA leak investigation /.
445,In a separate first person account Miller confirmed that she told the grand jury that Scooter Libby Dick Cheney 's top aide discussed with her as many as three times the role of Valerie Plame as a CIA employee /.
446,This says the Bush administration was angry about her husband Joe Wilson 's role in criticizing President Bush on whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction /.
447,The conclusion by a team of Times reporters /.
448,The Times incurred millions of dollars in legal fees in Miss Miller 's case /.
449,It limited its own ability to cover aspects of one of the biggest scandals of the day /.
450,Even as the paper asked for the public 's support it was unable to answer its questions /.
451,"Among the journalistic revelations, Miller released from jail last month says she pushed for a story on the outing of Valerie Plame back in two thousand three /."
452,She never wrote one /.
453,but her former boss says no way /.
454,that never happened /.
455,And the Times was so conflicted in covering the controversy the editors killed the story about Libby and pulled their punches in other ways /.
456,And joining us now in Los Angeles Arianna Huffington the syndicated columnist and founder of the blog huffington post dot com /.
457,in Minneapolis Lucy Dalglish executive director of the Reporters ' Committee for Freedom of the Press /.
458,and here in Washington Frank Sesno professor of public policy and communication at George Mason University and a CNN special correspondant /.
459,Frank Sesno has the New York Times belatedly to be sure fought and finally made an honest accounting of its role of Judy Miller 's role and the tensions that she created in the newsroom /?
460,Well an honest accounting /.
461,yeah maybe /.
462,but not a full accounting /.
463,You know and if the whole bottom line of this mess is that the public has the right to know and that that 's what this is all about the public still does n't know a lot of things /.
464,There 's still a lot of questions here /.
465,Why was that waiver that Miller was apparently granted by uh Scooter Libby a year ago /-
466,Why did it wait until she sat in jail for all that time before she actually took up on it /?
467,you know she 's referred to in the Times ' own account as Miss Run Amuck /.
468,She was pulled off of certain stories on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction /.
469,What are her motives and bottom lines to the secrecy of this whole thing /?
470,There 's a lot we still do n't know /.
471,Miss Run Amuck was a name she gave herself quite proudly apparently /.
472,Arianna Huffington the Times piece a lengthy piece acknowledges that Judy Miller was a controversial figure in the newsroom whose own WMD reporting was wrong and that while she claims to have pushed for this uh story on Valerie Plame two years ago Jill Abrahamson now the paper 's managing editor says No way /.
473,That did n't happen /.
474,In other words there 's a dispute in the accounts /.
475,Pretty candid stuff for a newspaper to publish about itself would n't you say /?
476,Well as Frank said there are many unanswered questions /.
477,And there are many very devastating eh comments and conclusions about Judy Miller as a journalist /.
478,I do n't think the Times had any choice though Howie . Because remember as a press reporter back on July twenty - seventh the turmoil in the newsroom has been going on for months about Judy Miller and the way the paper has decided to cover the story and the way they decided to present her as a martyr for the first amendment /.
479,And the main unanswered question here is why did Arthur Sulzberger the newspaper 's publisher allow Judy Miller to hijack the reporting of that story and the editorial policy on that story /.
480,And the similarities for the Jayson Blair case /.
481,Remember after the Jayson Blair scandal broke we had a seven thousand word story that did not give a full account of what happened . Especially about why is a major institution like the Times ignoring so many red flags /.
482,Alright /.
483,In the story one of things that we learn is that Bill Keller took Judy Miller off her WMD beat as one of his first personnel decisions when he took eh the reins as editor /.
484,Alright /.
485,Well uh I agree there are some unanswered questions /.
486,but I 'm willing to give the Times a little more credit than you for at least attempting to answer uh many of the questions /.
487,And Lucy Dalglish here 's the thing that jumped out at me in the story /.
488,Judy Miller acknowledges that at Louis Libby 's request this is the Dick Cheney aide she agreed to refer to him and in stories not as a senior administration official but as a former Hill aide because he had once worked on Capitol Hill /.
489,Do you have a problem with that sort of thing /?
490,I thought that was a little bit misleading /.
491,And I thought it was odd /.
492,I mean her justification was that well he had been a former Hill staffer /.
493,Um but that was a strange request /.
494,and I think the agreement was strange /.
495,I 'll agree with you on that /.
496,Frank Sesno the Times was so hamstrung by its passionate embrace of this reporter who after all was facing jail did go to jail /.
497,One can understand the emotions uh that were unleashed here /.
498,and yet the editors discouraged stories on the CIA leak investigation and one time killed a piece written by a reporter about Scooter Libby /.
499,Was that an abdication of journalistic responsibility /?
500,Maybe yeah maybe /.
501,I mean what it really shows Howie I think is just how difficult it is for news organizations to report on themselves /.
502,You know news organizations demand total transparency whether you 're General Motors or United States government /.
503,We want access /.
504,We want explanation /.
505,We want full disclosure /.
506,But it 's very difficult for them to do it themselves /.
507,In this case and the Times makes it very plain in their story today they really suffered /.
508,They were behind on virtually every major aspect of the story /.
509,Even when she went to jail /?
510,Even when she went to jail and w- /.
511,When she won release from jail /.
512,Yeah at the point that she came out /.
513,They did n't say that you know until she walked out /.
514,And the question and this is a very serious question it 's not answered in the article /.
515,Were editorial higher - ups and were the corporate lawyers at the New York Times in some way leaning on suppressing and distorting the coverage from the news uh section /?
516,Arianna Huffington uh in this lengthy piece this morning uh uh Judy Miller is quoted excuse me as saying that there was another source beside Scooter Libby that she dealt with on the Valerie Plame situation /.
517,She does n't recall who that source was looking at her notes and seeing the uh notation Valerie Flame /.
518,She got the name wrong /.
519,Do you buy this notion that she does n't recall who this other source was /?
520,No of course not Howie /.
521,In fact I think this is the major unanswered question /.
522,We do n't know who eh her source was when it comes to revealing the identity of Valerie Plame /.
523,And to say that she does not recall is really as convincing as having Woodward and Bernstein saying that they do not recall who Deep Throat was /.
524,After all these notes were just a few weeks old when um the Valerie Plame Bob Novak column appeared and when the whole Washington and the whole journalistic community was talking about it /.
525,You know I do n't /-
526,Incidentally there was some questions uh that Judy Miller would not answer to her colleagues /.
527,and she would n't share her notes with them although they 've been turned over to the special prosecutor /.
528,Lucy Dalglish the big news for me was Miller recounting what her lawyer Floyd Abrams had said to her about a conversation that he had with Joe Tate who was Scooter Libby 's lawyer /.
529,Uh says um Floyd Abrams according to Miller 's account when I would n't give him Tate an assurance that you would exonerate Libby he said do n't go there /.
530,Now Tate by the way tells the Times that that account is false and outrageous /.
531,Does this help justify eh Judy Miller 's otherwise mysterious decision to go to jail and not accept the waiver of confidentiality that Scooter Libby offered and sit in jail for eighty - five days /?
532,N- you n- /.
533,you know I 've been talking to Judy off and on about this case for the last year /.
534,This was a very difficult decision /.
535,and you know what this all comes down to is you keep your promises when you make a promise to a confidential source /.
536,You 'll recall six or eight months ago Howie I was on the show and we were talking about you know did Russert and Kessler and all the rest of those guys did they break some trust by agreeing to testify and observing the waiver /?
537,What I think this situation and the turmoil that is obviously going on at the Times right now points out is the fact that we have a major problem in this country /.
538,it 's that reporters believe they need to keep their promises to their sources /.
539,Reporters will try to do whatever they can as long as the law allows them to protect those sources /.
540,Right /.
541,But these days um with the state of our law the fact that we do not have a federal shield law we have prosecutors and civil litigants going in there and interfering with the day to day operation of our newsrooms /.
542,and we just can tolerate this /.
543,And we 're trying to /-
544,I think Lucy 's on to something here if I can just say Howie /.
545,And I think this is very important because this is an ugly case /.
546,And even people close to Judith Miller say this is not the one you 'd really like to go to the mat on /.
547,You 'd love to have a clear whistle blower case /.
548,You 'd love to have a Pentagon papers case /.
549,You 'd love to have something where the well - being and the sanctity of the Republic you know hangs in the balance /.
550,She did n't even report on this /.
551,But it does point out a very serious issue /.
552,And that is the whole notion of the use of and abuse of confidential sources the protections that reporters do or do n't have and the propensity of uh the United States government to have more secrecy not less /.
553,We 've got to figure this out /.
554,Well just to clarify uh she did ultimately uh testify about her confidential source /.
555,The whole issue was how voluntary was the waiver of her promise to Scooter Libby offered and why was she able to accept after being in jail as opposed to before being in jail /.
556,Well exactly /.
557,and you know what Howie /. /.
558,it 's really time for Lucy and other Judy Miller defenders to update her talking points because what Lucy just said just simply does not wash /.
559,The truth is that as Howie said she did testify /.
560,The truth is that it 's very clear from the stories today that she could 've asked uh Scooter Libby to call her so that she could hear the timber of his voice earlier /.
561,All of that could have happened /.
562,It did not happen because clearly Judy Miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the American public /.
563,And the New York Times is /.
564,Lucy /.
565,/.
566,Let me get a response from Lucy Dalglish /.
567,I think it 's very obvious from what Judy wrote today she is protecting somebody else /.
568,And one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was she negotiating what she was going to say about Scooter Libby but you got to keep in mind I 'm a lawyer there were lawyers involved in this /.
569,They had to negotiate with Patrick Fitzgerald what he would not talk about /.
570,They also had to negotiate whether or not there would be any type of um uh uh obstruction charges connected with contacting /.
571,Once you invoke the wrath or the extreme interest of a federal prosecutor you have to be very very careful /.
572,You do n't mess with the Feds /.
573,It 's very clear in her story that she decided finally to testify because she got tired of jail because she was threatened with criminal contempt charges because she wanted to go out and now she 's saying admitting finally write a book /.
574,All these things are there in black and white /.
575,and to continue to portray her as a martyr is not going to work /.
576,And on that point Arianna on that point she says sh- /-
577,Excuse me /.
578,Judy Miller says she 's taking some time off from the paper /.
579,She wants to write a book /.
580,She would n't share her notes with her colleagues who were writing the story /.
581,Do you think she 'll ever come back /?
582,You think she 's saving it for the book /?
583,Well it 's very clear that she would not be welcome in the newsroom /.
584,And it 's very clear eh as I reported again that when Bill Keller took her off her WMD beat they were all hoping she would resign /.
585,Instead she threw a fit /.
586,but she stayed on /.
587,This is not a journalism one oh one course the way she handled both the WMD reporting and Plame Gate /.
588,Frank Sesno please comment /.
589,Jump in /.
590,And Howie I 'll tell you what /.
591,This is a gigantic shot across the bow of every manager in the news business and every editor and every executive producer anywhere because you got to have some uh control some connection with your correspondants and your reporters /.
592,You got to know who they 're talking to at some level anyway because you know what /?
593,It 's about trust with the public /.
594,and it 's about you know ending up in jail or in court /.
595,their story says that Bill Keller and Arthur Sulzberger did not press Judy Miller about her conversations with Libby or ask to see her notes while they were defending her /.
596,Ask to see her /.
597,And by the way we invited the New York Times to have an editor appear on this program /.
598,The paper declined /.
599,When we come back media speculation run amuck over possible indictments at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania and the President 's scripted session with troops in Iraq /.
600,Stay with us /.
601,Welcome back to Reliable Sources /.
602,As the CIA leak investigation continued this week media folks did plenty of speculating with no evidence about the possible indictment of a certain top White House official who testified before the grand jury for the fourth time on Friday /.
603,Karl Rove his closest aide the number two man in the White House the man that has been called Bush 's brain /.
604,If he 's indicted and has to go it undermines the key source of this President 's public support his character /.
605,If Rove gets indicted that could bring down the Bush administration I think /.
606,My understanding from talking to somebody quite close to this investigation is that they think there are going to be indictments /.
607,and possibly Karl Rove could be among them /.
608,"Lucy Dalglish if Karl Rove is indicted , if Karl Rove is indicted , what if he 's not indicted /?"
609,Is n't this the worst kind of journalistic speculation /?
610,Yeah /.
611,You know I think it 's always dangerous to speculate whether or not you 're really besmirching someone 's reputation . Although I 'm not sure you can do that with Karl Rove /.
612,But it uh is very very you know eh irre- /-
613,I would prefer that people keep an eye on you know watching him testify and going in and out of the courthouse /.
614,But uh will it bring down the administration /?
615,I do n't know /.
616,Ah eh I do n't know /.
617,Well nobody knows /.
618,That 's the point /.
619,Arianna Huffington I used to cover the justice department /.
620,Not everybody who 's under investigation winds up getting indicted /.
621,Ah but you certainly and you 're uh on a blog so maybe it 's a different standard have speculated about Rove 's fate as well /.
622,Well not just Rove though /.
623,what we have speculated is that it might be a much more tangled web that Fitzgerald is after the whole Iraq White House group the group that uh in Cheney 's office with Libby and Rove and Mary Matalin and Condoleezza Rice and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war to the American public based on lies /.
624,I mean that is really the web /.
625,"But it seems and we find out today also from uh um the reporting on the Miller story , that uh Fitzgerald is after Cheney even in some of the questioning eh of Miller /."
626,I think those were fairly routine questions about /.
627,you have Judy Miller there /.
628,you ask about Cheney /. /.
629,He was being thorough /.
630,I think we 're overthinking this whole thing /.
631,Karl Rove and this speculation business you know /.
632,Frank Sesno /.
633,Pat Fitzgerald /.
634,It 's very easy to sit here and say oh we should never speculate in journalism /.
635,It 's irresponsible journalism /.
636,It 's really how you speculate not that you speculate /.
637,The fact of the matter is that Karl Rove has been to the grand jury four times /.
638,The fact of the matter is that there are lots of people in Washington and believe me they 're not all journalists who are speculating what if the guy gets indicted /.
639,It would be irresponsible I think for the media not to reflect what the discussion is here in town /.
640,And there are plenty of Republicans mostly Republicans who are worried about this /.
641,Alright I want to turn now to uh President Bush 's uh meeting uh uh photo op some called it with US troops in Iraq whether it was staged how shocking that would be /.
642,Let 's take a look at the actual footage /.
643,And in your interactions with the Iraqi civilians in Tikrit Saddam 's hometown how are they reacting to this political process /?
644,Sir in the north central area of Iraq voter registration has increased seventeen percent /.
645,Can you give us a sense for the reception of the people there in Tikrit /?
646,Sir in north central Iraq voter regis- /-
647,Are you stunned /?
648,Are you stunned /?
649,Shocked /.
650,I ca n't believe it /.
651,they rehearsed it /.
652,They rehearsed it /.
653,They rehearsed it /.
654,Yeah you know something /?
655,uh I remember a long time ago Michael Deaver the ultimate image meister for Ronald Reagan said my job is to light the President well and for everything I do to put the President in a good light /.
656,Now look first of all this is uncomfortable to see /.
657,and what the problem this now creates for the White House is {is} it plays into the credibility issue that the President has that everything now is becoming a photo op and a rehearsed event in order to rescue what are tumbling numbers on his performance on public support of Iraq the whole bit /.
658,But the fact that anybody would think that you would do something like this a remote /.
659,I mean anybody in television will tell you that 's complicated business /.
660,You have satellite delay /.
661,You have a half a dozen people sitting there /.
662,Who 's going to speak when /.
663,You do n't want awkward silences /.
664,You 're going to walk through it /.
665,so that it happened does n't surprise me /.
666,That it hurts the President yeah that 's inevitable too /.
667,Arianna Huffington does the staging here surprise you at all /?
668,Well it 's not the question of surpising me Howie /.
669,It 's the fact that we are talking about war /.
670,This is not just any photo opportunity /.
671,Of course that 's part and parcel of the presidency /.
672,But we 're talking about a war in which almost two thousand young Americans have died /.
673,And we are also using soldiers as props /.
674,Yes it is shocking /.
675,and I think Keith Olbermann did a phenomenal job at exposing this on MSNBC /.
676,Alright /.
677,And I think more and more journalists are actually taking a hard look at what this administration is doing /.
678,And we 'll have to leave it there /.
679,Last word /.
680,Arianna Huffington Lucy Dalglish in Minneapolis Frank Sesno thanks so very much for joining us /.
681,"Coming up , we launch our new segment Talk Back to the Media /."
682,President Clinton 's former lawyer Lanny Davis takes on Sixty Minutes and ex-FBI director Louis Freeh /.
683,And still to come New York Times columnist Tom Friedman /.
684,Welcome back /.
685,In our new Talk Back to the Media segment someone who believes he or she 's been treated unfairly by the press gets the chance to sound off and give their side of the controversy /.
686,Last Sunday Mike Wallace sat down with Louis Freeh who 's peddling a memoir on Sixty Minutes /.
687,and the former FBI director unloaded on the President who appointed him Bill Clinton /.
688,Among his criticisms the former president 's handling of the nineteen ninety - six Khobar Towers terrorist bombing that killed nineteen US marines in Saudi Arabia /.
689,I was very disappointed that the political leadership of the United States uh would tell the families of these nineteen heroes that we were going to leave no stone unturned and find the people who killed them /.
690,to give that order to the director because that 's the order that I got and then to do nothing to assist and facilitate that investigation in fact to undermine it /.
691,The Clinton people were furious at the way Sixty Minutes hailed the segment /.
692,and here to talk back is former Clinton White House attorney Lanny Davis /.
693,Welcome /.
694,Let 's deal with the substance first /.
695,"Louis Freeh says that when Clinton met with Crown Prince Abdullah in nineteen ninety - eight , he did n't press for FBI access to suspects in the Khobar Towers bombing and he hit up the prince for a contribution to his presidential library /."
696,Well not only is that false and President Clinton has said so but everybody who attended the meeting not including Louis Freeh says it 's false /.
697,And my problem with Sixty Minutes is that they never called anybody at the meeting /.
698,Until Friday afternoon we did n't even know the charge was being made /.
699,And even then they were unwilling to put somebody on the air to contradict Mister Freeh /.
700,Sixty Minutes says Bill Clinton was offered a chance to come on and give his rebuttal /.
701,What 's wrong with that /?
702,Well first of all it 's absolutely amazing that Sixty Minutes thinks it 's okay to air a false and malicious statement /.
703,This is a terrible charge that an FBI investigation was thwarted because President Clinton wanted to receive money for his library /.
704,The charge was false /.
705,and the only way that that can be countered is a former president of the United States /?
706,What about anybody at the meeting who was willing to be on /?
707,What about them doing reporting themselves before they air a false and demonstrably false charge /?
708,That 's my problem /.
709,What about Sandy Berger the former national security advisor under President Clinton /?
710,He was at the meeting /.
711,He was in the room /.
712,Did you offer him for an on - camera interview /?
713,Well on Friday afternoon /.
714,You were n't there /.
715,I was not there /.
716,You 're good on television /.
717,but you were n't there /.
718,uh I talked to Sandy Berger /.
719,We issued a statement from Mister Berger /.
720,but this was Friday afternoon when we first learned about it with Sunday broadcast /.
721,Why did n't Sixty Minutes invite Mister Berger or other people at the meeting before Friday afternoon /?
722,Why did it take us to get Sixty Minutes to do basic reporting to verify facts /?
723,It 's not enough to have Louis Freeh say something is so based on an anonymous source /.
724,That 's poor journalism /.
725,On that point let me read a statement from a Sixty Minutes spokesman /.
726,And this involves uh their saying that they contacted Clinton 's office back in August with a detailed list of charges and then quote in subsequent phone calls the President 's people said he did not want to be interviewed /.
727,They gave no +substantive response to any of the allegations until Lanny Davis launched his PR campaign on the Thursday before the broadcast and offered himself as the person from the camp who would merely disparage and attack Freeh rather than deal with his allegations /.
728,Denials from President Clinton and Sandy Berger that did deal with Freeh 's allegations were included in the Sixty Minutes report /.
729,Well first of all it 's false to say that I was asking to disparage Freeh /.
730,I was asking to talk about facts that Freeh was saying that were not true /.
731,You do n't mind disparaging Freeh /.
732,my observation /.
733,no in fact I disparage any man who as FBI director has a personal pique rather than doing his job /.
734,That 's disparaging /.
735,Secondly it is absolutely a misrepresentation that they told us before just the week before /.
736,When Mister Carson the representative spoke to Mister Wallace Mister Wallace agreed that they had never verified what Mister uh Freeh had said /.
737,They never talked to Mister Freeh /.
738,and in fact it was n't until that Friday that we learned the substance of Mister Freeh 's charges /.
739,So Sixty Minutes I think has just said something that is false /.
740,When did the Clinton team find out that Sixty Minutes was going to report that Louis Freeh with his new book was going to have a specific allegation about Clinton 's handling of the Khobar Towers investigation and the business about the presidential library solicitation /.
741,When somebody named Howard Kurtz wrote a story in the Washington Post on Friday morning is the first time that the Clinton forces learned about that false and demonstrably false charge that good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting could have done would have verified that Mister Freeh made a false charge /.
742,And even since that interview Mister Freeh has backed off and has not told people who his source is /.
743,and he has n't even insisted that it was true /.
744,He just said somebody told him it was true /.
745,Hold on /.
746,Sixty Minutes spokesman Kevin Tedesco said in the statement I just referred to that the Clinton office was contacted in August with a detailed list of charges /.
747,That 's false /.
748,Are you saying that 's false /?
749,They were never told /. /.
750,or at least I 'm now basing this on what Mister Carson has told me /.
751,Jay Carson is the spokesman for former president Bill Clinton /.
752,Jay Carson is the spokesperson for President Clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the Khobar Towers which happens to be not true /.
753,President Clinton at that uh meeting did press the uh Crown Prince to cooperate with the FBI /.
754,so what Mister Freeh said was false /.
755,That was not understood by the Clinton people until it was read in the Washington Post in the story that you wrote because Sixty Minutes put a press release out /.
756,Uh now look Lanny Davis Sixty Minutes gave Bill Clinton one hour last year to push his own ten million dollar autobiography /.
757,He criticized people /.
758,He criticized Ken Starr /.
759,They did n't have Ken Starr on to rebut /.
760,Now the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation uh who ca n't stand Clinton clearly writes a book gets one segment for his book /.
761,and you cry foul /.
762,Nobody was complaining about when Bill Clinton was getting all this airtime on CBS /.
763,Look /.
764,Look this is a program about good journalism /.
765,Let 's ask a Sixty Minutes uh journalist to say do you have an obligation to verify a charge made by the former FBI director as whether it 's true or not /.
766,Is it good enough to air it just because he says it /.
767,or should you do reporting /?
768,Good reporters would hear that charge and say that is an extremely serious charge to be levelled against former president Clinton /.
769,Let 's see whether it 's true and start making phone calls /.
770,They did not do that /.
771,That 's a fact /.
772,Alright Lanny Davis thanks very much for coming on to Talk Back to the Media this morning /.
773,We appreciate it /.
774,Ahead in the second half of Reliable Sources New York Times columnist Tom Friedman on whether the media are suffering from Iraq fatigue /.
775,Plus that heavily hyped subway threat that was n't /.
776,After an update on the hour 's top stories from Atlanta /.
777,Hello I 'm at the CNN center in Atlanta /.
778,Now in the news /.
779,Earthquake relief flights have resumed in Pakistan /.
780,That 's after torrential rain stopped flights for hours there /.
781,And a Pakistani helicopter crashed killing six soldiers /.
782,A magnitude seven point six earthquake struck last weekend as you recall /.
783,Pakistan 's prime minister says it killed at least thirty - eight thousand people and left about two and a half million homeless /.
784,Toledo Ohio is quiet this morning after a planned march by a self - styled nazi group sparked a riot yesterday /.
785,The Associated Press says police arrested at least sixty - five people /.
786,The march never got started /.
787,but hundreds of counter-demonstrators showed up and battled police on and off for more than three hours /.
788,Police say the protestors vandalized vehicles and buildings setting at least one structure on fire /.
789,Look at this /.
790,a semi-truck and a bus carrying high school band members collided overnight on interstate ninety - four and in Wisconsin /.
791,The Associated Press quotes the Wisconsin state patrol as saying at least five people were killed /.
792,The students were from Chippewa Falls Wisconsin /.
793,They were returning from a band competition at the University of Wisconsin in Whitewater /.
794,Those are the headlines this morning /.
795,I 'm in Atlanta /.
796,We have another news update coming up in just thirty minutes /.
797,More of CNN 's Reliable Sources continues right now /.
798,Welcome back to the second half of Reliable Sources /.
799,Our new time for those of you just turning in is ten AM eastern seven on the west coast /.
800,And we 'll be bringing you a full hour of media interviews and analysis each week /.
801,The Iraq story which the media has placed on the back burner in recent months is simmering again as voters in that war torn country went to the polls yesterday to vote on a new constitution with the results yet to be counted /.
802,But are journalists getting the real story there /?
803,To help us scrutinize the coverage I sat down with a foreign affairs columnist of the New York Times three time Pulitzer winner Tom Friedman and the author most recently of The World is Flat /.
804,Tom Friedman welcome /.
805,Good to be here Howie /.
806,thank you /.
807,The other day you wrote that if you were the editor of the New York Times you would 've led the paper with the news of recent days that a Sunni suicide bomber on Ramadan had attacked a Shiite mosque /.
808,Now in reality the world that you do n't rule New York Times Washington Post made that part of a larger story on Iraq /.
809,Uh nobody put it on the front page /.
810,Bad news judgement /?
811,Uh I think so Howie /.
812,I 'm not here to make a news point though /.
813,I 'm really making a larger point which is about the war on terrorism /.
814,I 'm a firm believer /.
815,How we ever going to win this war /?
816,We 're never going to win it by way of American intelligence finding this terrorist or that terrorist /.
817,We get lucky every once in a while /.
818,but there 's only {one?} way we win this war Howie is it takes a village /.
819,It only happens when the Sunni Muslim world basically turns people in and when the Sunni Muslim world restrains their own /.
820,And what was so shocking to me about this story a Sunni Jihadi suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of Ramadan /.
821,What that tells you is that there 's no controlling moral authority today in the Sunni Muslim world /.
822,Well what is the bigger story /?
823,And that is a huge story /.
824,I think it should have been a big story /.
825,Why was n't /-
826,Is it because of Iraq fatigue /?
827,Um /.
828,I think it is yeah /.
829,Think it 's /-
830,Are all the editors and producers and new executives feeling another day another bombing ten killed twenty killed fifteen killed /.
831,and it does n't rise anymore to the top of the newscast or the front page /?
832,Right /.
833,Yeah and I think that 's right /.
834,There is Iraq fatigue /.
835,And there 's so much fatigue that we do n't sit back and say wait a minute /.
836,what happened today /?
837,A Sunni Muslim fundamentalist went into a mosque on the first day of Ramadan their holiest day /.
838,and no one says boo /.
839,this is civilization that when we accidentally or deliberately I do n't know abused the Koran people rioted in Pakistan /.
840,Yet their own houses of worship and holidays are being defiled /.
841,And I think it is a measure of how much we 've kind of lost been numbed by all of this that we do n't sit back and say wow wait a minute /.
842,that really crosses the line /.
843,and we have to call them on it even if they do n't /.
844,You 're recently back from Iraq /.
845,and you write about driving in from Kuwait /.
846,You were guarded by the US navy /.
847,and yet it was kind of a harrowing experience /.
848,Why so /?
849,Um you know the south of Iraq which is where I was the area around /.
850,This is the safe part /.
851,Right exactly /.
852,I was in the safe district /.
853,I was guarded uh by the British Royal Marines actually because unfortunately they 've had now um uh roadside bombs down there not suicide bombs /.
854,And it 's part of the general continuing insecurity of Iraq that um I 'm afraid has plagued this story from the very beginning /.
855,And it 's been I 've always felt the Achille 's heel /.
856,You know my criticism of the Bush administration as you know we 've talked about this before is not that this war is not important /.
857,I believe it is important much more important than I think the left has ever fully recognized /.
858,But it 's so much harder than the right has ever been willing to acknowledge /.
859,And on that trip you put on body armor /.
860,their rifles were out /.
861,Yeah /.
862,Um how does that affect your perception as a journalist /?
863,You 're there /.
864,you 're being protected /.
865,and you must have been a little bit nervous of what the safety situation is in there /.
866,Well I 'll tell you what 's really frustrating from a journalist 's point of view as one who have lived in Beirut for nearly five years covered that war /.
867,When I worked in Lebanon you could go anywhere on that story /.
868,You could cross lines /.
869,Journalists worked for the most part until the very end with Terry Anderson the kidnappings targets /.
870,Therefore by the end of the Lebanon story I thought the best journalists there knew more than the Lebanese /.
871,I always thought the best compliment you could get as a journalist is when you told the Lebanese something they did n't know because you were moving around so much /.
872,What 's so frustrating about the Iraq story Howie no one has a bird 's eye view /.
873,I care passionately about this story /.
874,I 'm so interested in it /.
875,but because of the securtiy situation you ca n't move around with the freedom you want /.
876,And the brave reporters who are there every day do n't have that freedom of movement either /.
877,And therefore it 's limited /.
878,and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some biases in the media /.
879,There 's a lot of good things going on in Iraq /.
880,There 's a lot of progress being made we 're not seeing reported by the press /.
881,Do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there /?
882,No because I do n't have a bird 's eye view /.
883,I wish I could say /.
884,I wish I could be so sure /.
885,but General Casey does n't have a bird 's eye view /.
886,And that 's why we get surprises in Iraq /.
887,Uh that 's why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out /.
888,and maybe you know we 're going to see more surpises in the coming future there /.
889,But because no one can move around with the freedom that you need to talk to everyone you do n't have that bird 's eye view /.
890,And as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story I find that really frustra- /-
891,I can not report it the way I 'd love to /.
892,So I 've been there five times /.
893,but it 's episodic /.
894,It 's here /.
895,It 's there /.
896,It 's never really putting your arms around the story /.
897,pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you 'd have to say that the Iraq story has been overshadowed by Katrina by Rita by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by this Pakistan earthquake /.
898,Um inevitable with a war that drags on and on /.
899,and these are all also important stories obviously /.
900,but uh do you feel it 's getting the attention that it should /?
901,Yeah /.
902,No because to me this is the whole ballgame of the Bush administration /.
903,Katrina and Rita they 'll come and go /.
904,but at the end of the day the Bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to Iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /.
905,If that happens then I think President Bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there /.
906,Um if it does n't happen I think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /.
907,so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the American people /.
908,These are huge stakes involved /.
909,And so I do n't think it 's gotten the attention it 's deserved /.
910,And going back again to one of your Iraq collumns uh you observed the Iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict /.
911,The slightly ragged quality left you feeling you write that if you pulled the US and British advisors out tomorrow the whole Iraqi navy would collapse /.
912,That 's a pretty pessimistic assessment and clearly at odds with what the White House and the Defense Department say every day /.
913,/.
914,Not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying which is that the number of really trained Iraqi units you know are far fewer than sometimes suggested by the administration /.
915,So you 're saying there 's a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing to tell you not necessarily on the record /.
916,You quoted one US senior official and what the President of the United States and the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense are saying to reporters every day /.
917,Are we calling them on that /?
918,Right I do n't think enough because there 's been a lot of happy talk around this Howie basically /.
919,And a lot of numbers are thrown out /.
920,Eighty thousand this week we 've got trained a hundred and twenty thousand next week /.
921,Here 's what you learn when you go to Iraq /.
922,Where you have an Iraqi commander who 's a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit /.
923,And where you do n't have that commander you do n't have a unit /.
924,So the numbers the macro numbers do n't mean anything /.
925,So I went down to see the navy there /.
926,The navy of Iraq has a terrific commander /.
927,so the people around him they 'll follow him into battle /.
928,But you take that one guy out there 's no Iraqi navy /.
929,and it 's true of units all over the country /.
930,That 's really the key /.
931,You say that you are angry uh that Bush has fought the war as though it would be easy /.
932,Are you particularly angry as somebody who supported the war and took heat from some of your liberal friends for doing so /?
933,Yes /.
934,Absolutely because I believe this is important /.
935,I believe that something very big is at stake /.
936,"We 're dealing with a Muslim Arab civilization right now that 's that 's in decline , that 's heading in the wrong direction in ways that are dangerous for them and I believe dangerous for the stability of the world /."
937,There 's something really important here at stake /.
938,and what makes me so angry at the Bush administration is not that they did n't frame the stakes /.
939,It is important /.
940,But they never never appreciated how difficult it was /.
941,They never prepared the army or the American people for how difficult it was /.
942,I mentioned the uh devastating earthquake in Pakistan a region you 're familiar with /.
943,Um clearly it 's become a pretty big story /.
944,but for the first couple days I noticed it was n't that much of a television story /.
945,and the reason was no pictures no video /.
946,No yes /.
947,Um but also maybe there was there a little bit less coverage because it 's in a remote part of the world /?
948,Uh Westerners are more interested in New Orleans than in Pakistan /?
949,I think all of the above /.
950,We 're so numbed also after Katrina and Rita /.
951,and now another earthquake /.
952,/.
953,It 's just become uh one natural disaster after another /.
954,to hear ten thousand twenty thousand forty thousand then it 's almost hard for a journalist to process /.
955,Right /.
956,And it was remote /.
957,and people are exhausted I think both viewers and reporters /.
958,Ahead have New York Times columnists been asked not to write about Judy Miller /?
959,More of my interview with Tom Friedman next /.
960,Welcome back to Reliable Sources now a full hour each week here in our new time slot ten to eleven o'clock eastern /.
961,More now of my conversation with New York Times columnist Tom Friedman about his book the new online charge to read him and Judy Miller /.
962,Now your new book The World is Flat I 've got it here /.
963,uh monster best seller more than a million copies better than any book you 've ever written before /.
964,Um you were recently profiled about this in Fortune magazine /.
965,and uh let 's just say that it did n't say you walked on water but it came close /.
966,Uh but one of the criticisms /-
967,What 's wrong with that /?
968,It says that you 're the composer of the nation 's talking points which was news to me /.
969,Uh one of the things it said was that uh in your book and in your writing that CEOs play a very central role /.
970,"And the suggestion was well CEOs love you , you 're asked to speak at all these corporate events , maybe because you give them a very large uh share of the narrative /."
971,Yeah /.
972,Mhm /.
973,Mhm /.
974,That a reasonable observation /?
975,Yeah it is a reasonable observation /.
976,And my reaction to that is look if I want to understand the underlying technology that is flattening the world who do I go to /?
977,do I go to I do n't know Central America /?
978,Do I go to um uh the factory floor /?
979,Or do I go to the innovators and entrepeneurs who actually put all this together /?
980,So I make no apology for that at all /.
981,Um fact I would make a criticism of it /.
982,There are n't enough people during the last few years who actually went out and talked to the innovators who are doing all of these things who are actually reshaping the world /.
983,Just the opposite /.
984,We kind of had an Enron effect /.
985,"and Enron effect was all CEOs are guilty unless proven innocent , therefore who wants to talk to them /?"
986,And therefore I would argue -- /.
987,Wait a second /.
988,wait a second /.
989,Journalists uh subscribe to stereotypes because there are a few crooks at major corporations because you know they 're all bad guys /?
990,Yeah yeah /.
991,Yeah I would say /.
992,uh that 's a harsh uh assessment /.
993,I would say that there 's several things happened basically in the last three years /.
994,I would call it a perfect storm /.
995,One was nine eleven /.
996,That distracted us okay /.
997,The other was the Enron effect /.
998,You know no one wanted to be sort of seen with CEOs /.
999,And number three was the dot com bust which made everyone think well all this globalization technology stuff is really over /.
1000,And as a result I would argue that really masked what is actually a fundemental inflection point the flattening of the world that we 're going from a vertical value creation model of command and control to a much more horizontal one of connect and collaborate /.
1001,The argument of this book is that that shift is actually going to have as big an effect over time as Gutenberg and the printing press /.
1002,And I would argue a little bit that it got missed because of all these other distractions /.
1003,But it 's only had an effect on Tom Friedman 's career /.
1004,In fact you were the Playboy interview /.
1005,Hey put that paper down /.
1006,/.
1007,I bought it for the articles /.
1008,Uh I enjoyed the interview /.
1009,and you said in there that your wife uh edits all your columns and she says do n't publish it /.
1010,Yes she does /.
1011,You go back and rewrite it /.
1012,I 'm afraid I do /.
1013,/.
1014,My wife Andrea edits them all /.
1015,and when she gives me thumbs down Howie I have to put it in a ball throw it in the circular file and start over /.
1016,and she 's a tough editor /.
1017,Now your international readership on the New York Times website has gone down because of this new experiment the Times has where it costs forty nine ninety - five a year for non-subscribers at home to read Times columnists /.
1018,That 's got to be disappointing for you /.
1019,You know um I 'm torn /.
1020,Uh and I 've said this to my bosses /.
1021,Um I want my paper to thrive /.
1022,and if we have a situation where young people grow up in the world that thinks that newspapers are things you read for free online who 's going to pay my travel expenses /?
1023,And at the same time one of the greatest things about New York Times online is I got to reach an audience that just was exponential to what you got in the dead tree edition of the New York Times /.
1024,And because I write about international affairs so I got a lot of young people in India and Egypt and whatnot /.
1025,and for them fifty dollars that may be their tuition for half a year /.
1026,So I 'm honestly torn /.
1027,I really hope this works because I want the New York Times to have a platform that is sustainable /.
1028,But at the same time I hope we can eventually find a way to re-engage those people because definitely we 've lost some of them /.
1029,"Eh in the Valerie Plame leak investigation there 's an allegation bouncing around the blogosphere that I just thought I would address with you which is have New York Times columnists somehow been told not to write about this because of Judy Miller 's involvement and being in jail , now being out of jail /."
1030,absolutely not /.
1031,Anybody tell you not to write about it /?
1032,I mean they do n't tell me not to write about anything /.
1033,Howie we are home alone okay /.
1034,I mean I 'm going to China uh on Monday /.
1035,and there 's only one person knows I 'm going /.
1036,and that 's my assistant /.
1037,So um /-
1038,Did you even tell the boss /?
1039,That 's right /. so there 's no edict out there /.
1040,why people have n't written about it I do n't know /.
1041,I 'm focused on other things /.
1042,There 's a lot we do n't know obviously about the Judith Miller situation /.
1043,but why do you think that she has gotten so much criticism /?
1044,After all whether you agree with her or not this is a woman who believed in her convictions and went off to jail for eighty - five days /.
1045,Um you know um Judy 's always been a pioneer and an agent of change you know um and uh has been at the forefront of a lot of stories /.
1046,and people like that in our business um uh engender a lot of attention a lot of criticism and a lot of jealousy /.
1047,Um and uh that 's the only way I can really explain /.
1048,Tom Friedman /.
1049,Up next did the media get carried away with last week 's subway terror alert /?
1050,We 'll ride the rails into the spin cycle next /.
1051,When New York mayor Mike Bloomberg announced last week that there was a possible terror threat against the city 's subways I thought here we go again /.
1052,And television was all over the story /.
1053,Here in New York tonight officials say they are increasing security on the city 's massive subway system because of what they call a significant and credible threat /.
1054,The threat to attack the subways in coming days comes from overseas /.
1055,and the police here will be searching bags briefcases even baby strollers to try to stop it /.
1056,It was let 's face it irresistable /.
1057,And since it was right there in the Big Apple cable anchors and correspondents could provide almost non-stop on the scene coverage /.
1058,The threat concerns the New York City subway system behind me around me literally beneath our feet here in Times Square /.
1059,The Fox News alert New York City subways are on a heightened state of alert this evening after what officials are describing as a specific threat /.
1060,And the city 's tabloids were n't far behind /.
1061,The problem as with so many previous terror alerts is that allegations from informants are inherently shaky /.
1062,And some correspondents offered caveats of course /.
1063,MSNBC anchor Keith Olbermann could n't help but notice on that day October six it was news that Karl Rove had been called back to testify in the CIA leak case and the white house is being assailed by conservatives over the Harriet Miers nomination /.
1064,events that have been politically disadvantageous to the current administration have been uh occuring simultaneously or followed quickly upon with something related to terrorism on a big scale /.
1065,By the next morning the New York Times and the Washington Post were reporting that federal authorities were playing down the threat as noncredible /.
1066,But the TV coverage kept rolling down the track like the number four express /.
1067,Finally last Tuesday some newspapers and then the cable networks reported that the whole thing was a hoax /.
1068,The CBS evening news gave that three sentences /.
1069,Well Jim Stewart of our Washington bureau quotes government sources tonight as saying the Iraqi man who gave that tip to US intelligence agents in Iraq now says the information was simply not true /.
1070,But that 's a lot more than NBC Nightly News and ABC 's World News Tonight which did n't mention the great subway hoax at all /.
1071,In an age of terror such threats obviously need to be reported /.
1072,but given the unreliability of intelligence television ought to learn a lesson here about not going on high alert and scaring people /.
1073,When we come back one network up the river without an explanation /.
1074,Reporters are tired of the usual standups you know Howard Kurtz Oshkosh Wisconsin /.
1075,They want to be riding on a train or walking in the rain or something to get attention /.
1076,So when NBC 's Michelle Kosinski was covering some flooding in New Jersey for the Today Show Friday she set out in a canoe /.
1077,And everything was going smoothly until /-
1078,Well take a look /.
1079,Good morning /.
1080,Well obviously we 're getting a nice break from the rain but not the flooding /.
1081,This is essentially now a part of the Passaic River in this neighborhood /.
1082,Two guys walk into the shot /.
1083,and we see that the water is only maybe four inches deep /.
1084,Talk about shallow reporting /.
1085,And as the Media Research Center pointed out this was right before the Today Show accused President Bush of staging his conversation with soldiers in Iraq /.
1086,Well that 's it for this edition of Reliable Sources /.
1087,Join us again next Sunday at our new time ten o'clock eastern seven pacific for a full hour of critiquing the media /.
1088,Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer begins right now /.
1089,This is Late Edition the last word in Sunday talk /.
1090,All the indications we are getting even /.
1091,Dealing with serial crimes per se /.
1092,We can see the emerging behavior /.
1093,we can see that this is a behavior that is not going to stop /.
1094,You can have hundreds of individuals as suspects and can narrow the focus of your investigation to a smaller pool of people /.
1095,And it gives you a starting point /.
1096,The good news is even though at any given point in time that there are these people out there perpetrating these crimes we are getting better at catching them and better at catching them sooner So that instead of waiting until they 've committed twelve crimes or instead of having twelve murders take place before we catch somebody now we may catch them after the first or second murder /.
1097,I will never in my lifetime learn why a serial killer becomes a serial killer /.
1098,But maybe the work that I 'm doing now will be able to take other people down avenues to explore with more tools with more ability to experiment with more ability to study on a hands - on basis /.
1099,But I will never learn that /.
1100,As a psychologist through all the interviews that I 've conducted all the cases that I 've reviewed what I 've learned is that these people while bright um and while at some level charming are emotionally and spiritually bankrupt /.
1101,and I 've learned that there is such a thing as evil /.
1102,While criminal profiling has been the topic of best selling books and award winning films it is merely one tool used to solve crimes /.
1103,The fact is that often offenders are caught while committing minor crimes like traffic violations or simply because they raise suspicion of local police /.
1104,That 's our crime files investigation /.
1105,I 'm John Seganthaler /.
1106,From NBC news in Washington this is Meet The Press with Tim Russet /.
1107,Our issues this Sunday North Korea 's Kim Jong - Il defies the world testing long range missiles which one day could deliver nuclear warheads /.
1108,Can this man be stopped /?
1109,With us from the Bush administration the third ranking official at the state department Ambassador Nicholas Burns The former Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter of Harvard University 's Kennedy school of government The man who led the negotiations for the nineteen ninety four nuclear agreement with North Korea Robert Gallucci Dean of the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University And the former US Ambassador to the United Nations who has visited North Korea five times Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico /.
1110,And in our Meet the Press Minute former President Gerald Ford turns ninety three this week /.
1111,He last appeared as president on Meet the Press thirty one years ago when he talked about age as a state of mind /.
1112,But first North Korea /.
1113,on the fourth of July North Korea tested medium and long range +missiles /.
1114,and their nuclear program appears to be full speed ahead /.
1115,What is the Bush administration going to do about it /?
1116,Here with us the Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns /.
1117,Mr. Ambassador good morning /.
1118,Thank you Tim /.
1119,good morning /.
1120,Will the United States insist that the United Nations impose sanctions against North Korea /?
1121,Well we are pursuing a very aggressive resolution up in New York at the Security Council /.
1122,and we think we 've got the votes to pass that /.
1123,But we 're also operating on multiple diplomatic fronts /.
1124,We have our lead negotiator Chris Hill Ambassador Hill in Beijing Seoul and Tokyo this week /.
1125,President Bush and Secretary Rice have been working the phones with uh their counterparts /.
1126,And we 've also had a very interesting development today /.
1127,the Chinese Government is sending tonight to a senior delegation /.
1128,And you know frankly we think it 's time for China to use its influence with North Korea /.
1129,The Chinese have influence certainly more than the United States and the other members of the international community dealing with this problem /.
1130,"China now has an opportunity to put its best foot forward , to send the North Koreans a direct message that these missile tests can not be tolerated and the North Koreans now have to come back to the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement and they 've got to denuclearize give up their nuclear ambitions and abide by the agreement that they made with the rest of us nearly a year ago /."
1131,But the South Koreans and the Chinese have both said they do not believe there should be sanctions against North Korea /.
1132,Will the US absolutely insist that there be sanctions in the UN resolution /?
1133,If you look at this UN resolution that 's under debate in New York it does /.
1134,it 's a chapter seven resolution so it has the effect of compulsory behavior by all the member states /.
1135,It says that what the North Koreans did was a threat to international peace and security /.
1136,It does ask all member states not to engage in nuclear trade with North Korea /.
1137,That strikes us as an obvious point /.
1138,And I think what we have to do we 'll see a lot of diplomacy over the next couple of days /.
1139,we 'll have to see how the Chinese and Russians react to this /.
1140,but our view is that the five parties ought to remain united and that the goal of the current diplomacy should be to use the combined leverage of China and Russia 's of South Korea Japan and the United States to force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.
1141,That 's certainly the best policy for the United States /.
1142,Force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.
1143,there are many as you know Mister Ambassador who believe the North Koreans did this launch on the fourth of July to get our attention Because they saw the way we were treating Iran differently than we were treating North Korea /.
1144,Here 's one Nicholas Burns on National Public Radio /.
1145,With Iran the United States has made an offer /.
1146,and that is we are willing to sit down and negotiate with the Iranians assuming and contingent upon their suspension of their nuclear activities at their plant in the in Iran /.
1147,Why not sit down in the same way with North Koreans Say to them stop developing your program /.
1148,and we 'll sit down with you one on one /.
1149,Well Tim we 're trying to sit down with the North Koreans in the context of the six party talks /.
1150,We 've been saying for months now that the right step forward is for North Korea to return to these talks /.
1151,but we really do n't see the logic in turning this into a test of wills between two countries the United States and North Korea /.
1152,The fact is that China has the same interest as the United States /.
1153,It should have the same interest /.
1154,And that is to stop the North Korea nuclear program /.
1155,Our allies Japan and South Korea have the same interests /.
1156,and the Russians do as well /.
1157,And so we think we 're far better off working within the framework of the six party talks because you get in that process the combined leverage the combined strength and frankly the combined pressure on North Korea of all these different countries /.
1158,I simply do n't see why it 's in the interest of the United States to get those countries out of the way and only deal with North Korea directly /.
1159,So the problem here is not the lack of discussion between the United States and North Korea /.
1160,We 're perfectly willing to sit down with them in that six party environment /.
1161,and in that sense it 's analogous to what we 're trying to do with Iran /.
1162,Secretary Rice announced about a month ago that should the Iranians meet the condition of suspension of their own nuclear activities we 'd be willing to sit down in another multilateral forum /.
1163,and that 's with the Europeans and Russians and Chinese /.
1164,So really you know the North Korea problem is not a problem just for the United States /.
1165,What they did the other day on July fourth was to disrupt the peace and harmony of their relations with the Asian countries /.
1166,And the Asian countries want to be involved in these negotiations /.
1167,Is it the policy of the Bush administration that we 'd like to see regime change in North Korea /?
1168,Well this is one of the most despotic regimes in the world /.
1169,it 's a major human rights violator /.
1170,There 's massive famine /.
1171,And certainly we hope for the day will come when those people will live in peace and be governed by a different type of government /.
1172,Uh what we 've got to do now of course is focus on the most immediate problem /.
1173,And that problem is nuclear weapons /.
1174,The problem is the ballistic launches of the other day /.
1175,"I think the thing to remember about those launches by the way they were provocative , they were reckless , they were also unsuccessful /."
1176,They fired four scud missiles intermediate range missiles /.
1177,They tried to fire the longer range missile the /.
1178,and that was spectacularly unsuccessful /.
1179,It crashed in the sea of Japan /.
1180,So we obviously have an opportunity now for diplomacy . And an opportunity to use the combined strength of all these countries to provide some leverage put some leverage against the North Koreans /.
1181,and that 's what we will continue to try to do in the coming days and coming weeks /.
1182,Will the United States give North Korea security assurances that we will not attack their country or seek to undermine their regime /?
1183,If you look back at this historic agreement that was signed in the six party frameworks on September nineteenth of two thousand five those types of assurances are in that agreement /.
1184,But the North Koreans have obligations /.
1185,and that is to take down their nuclear program dismantle it dismantle their weapons of mass destruction programs in a verifiable way before all those assurances can go into place /.
1186,All the other elements of the agreement can be put into place /.
1187,And what we 've seen since then is we 've seen the United States and Russia and China and Japan and South Korea willing to go forward willing to sit down willing to implement this entire agreement that you just referred to Tim /.
1188,but we see the North Koreans walking away from it /.
1189,So we 've got to be very persistent and frankly very tough in combining with these other countries to pressure the North Koreans to live up to their commitments /.
1190,But we would be willing to give North Korea increased economic aid perhaps light nuclear reactors for peaceful means and security assurance if in fact they sat down and negotiated /?
1191,The North Koreans know what 's in the September nineteenth agreement /.
1192,and it 's very specific about what the United States is willing to do uh to take a step forward towards them should they dismantle all their nuclear programs and their weapons of mass destruction /.
1193,But they 've got responsibilities in this agreement /.
1194,and no agreement is whole until both sides meet their agreement /.
1195,And what we 've seen Tim especially on July Fourth is the North Koreans in outright violation of the agreement that we made with them last September /.
1196,Why do you think the North Koreans chose July Fourth /?
1197,Oh I do n't think it was coincidental /.
1198,You know it 's a very unreliable and unpredictable regime /.
1199,The last thing we want to do is react to every wild statement that they make /.
1200,but they certainly chose that to get our attention and that of the international community /.
1201,Uh but what they 've got to realize is there is no magic bullet here /.
1202,They ca n't just think that they can sit down with the United States alone /.
1203,That does n't work for Japan /.
1204,it does n't work with South Korea /.
1205,and frankly it does n't work with the Chinese /.
1206,So I said before that one of the most interesting developments here is this Chinese delegation going to /.
1207,And Chris Hill our ambassador was in China a few days ago /.
1208,"he made the point and Secretary Rice made the point yesterday to the Chinese Foreign minister , we want to see China use its influence /."
1209,We want to see China push forward and ask the North Koreans to meet these commitments that they 've made to all of us /.
1210,Speaker Newt Gingrich the former speaker Republican weighed in on this debate in this way /.
1211,he offered this /.
1212,"The time to replace the state department 's failed North Korea strategy of talk forever , act never has come /."
1213,For thirteen years the United States has talked loudly about a North Korea nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat /.
1214,For thirteen years the North Korean dictatorship has lied and hunkered down and continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles /.
1215,The strategy of talking has failed /.
1216,America 's actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal totalitarian dictatorship about which we know little /.
1217,It is acting in defiance of all its own international commitments /.
1218,But the time for talk is over /.
1219,either they dismantle the missile /.
1220,or we the United States should dismantle it /.
1221,Well uh with all due respect to Speaker Gingrich we are on a course which has a reasonable chance of success /.
1222,And you never want to disavow a diplomatic track a negotiating track if you think you can resolve the problem in that fashion /.
1223,And as I said before we are not alone in this endeavor /.
1224,we have countries united with us who can apply the same type of pressure /.
1225,I will say this what the North Koreans have done over the past week is going to give a lot of strength in our efforts to develop a missile defense system /.
1226,You 've seen very strong statements by the Japanese government wanting to work with us in that realm /.
1227,So obviously we 're going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the North Koreans on their obligations To pressure them to come back to the talks But also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in Asia /.
1228,And I think you 'll see us move ahead smartly in that direction as well /.
1229,Uh Mister Ambassador many critics will say the six years George Bush has been president North Korea 's program has developed rather dramatically That the policy at first of isolation and then the six party talk just has n't worked /.
1230,Here 's the latest study from the Institute for Science and International Security /.
1231,They estimated a report that North Korea has enough separated plutonium to develop now an arsenal of four to thirteen nuclear weapons compared with estimates of just one or two weapons in two thousand when George bush became president /.
1232,The group says that by two thousand eight North Korea could have enough plutonium for eight to seventeen nuclear weapons /.
1233,The group 's assessment based on analysis of satellite imagery media reports and statements by North Korean officials which lead Nick Everstat a conservative critic from the American Enterprise Institute these are not Democrats /-
1234,he offered this /.
1235,although the Bush administration 's rhetoric about Kim Jong - Il and his regime has sometimes seemed ferocious North Korea 's leaders seem to have concluded that the Bush North Korea policy consists mainly of empty words and that oft repeated warning need not be taken terribly seriously /.
1236,By more than one criteria indeed strategic successes on the Bush watch outshine those from its during the Clinton years /.
1237,Would you acknowledge a significant increase in the nuclear capability by North Korea on the watch of President Bush /?
1238,Tim um obviously we profoundly disagree with um some of the statements that we 've just heard /.
1239,Eh you know we 've got a very strong military force and deterrent force at work in Asia and particularly on the Korean peninsula /.
1240,And that military can handle any contingency that should arise /.
1241,We also have a very tough policy and I think forward looking policy to develop missile defense to handle those contingencies /.
1242,But you 've got to combine military measures with diplomacy to be effective in a situation like this /.
1243,The fact is that a lot of this criticism seems to direct the United States back to a test of wills bilaterally between North Korea and the United States /.
1244,What we want to do is we want to ask countries that do have a great deal of influence on North Korea certainly more than we have to use that influence /.
1245,We can do that by channeling those efforts through the six party framework /.
1246,And you know diplomacy sometimes ca n't succeed in a day or two or a week or two /.
1247,Sometimes it takes many months or even years to succeed /.
1248,"But if you have the right policy in place , if you know what you 're trying to accomplish and if you 're very tough - minded about applying that policy we can be successful /."
1249,So we have not given up hope that we can engineer a policy that will effectively put the North Koreans back in the box take away their nuclear programs and take away their ability to inflict threats and damage on their neighbors /.
1250,We have got to be single - minded about this /.
1251,we certainly understand the gravity of a challenge posed by North Korea /.
1252,but frankly I do n't think these critics have offered any alternative that would have a reasonable prospect of success or lead us to unintended consequences uh if you went down the road that some of them are suggesting /.
1253,And we think we 've got the right policy in place /.
1254,and I can assure you we 're going to drive with a great deal of energy and determination /.
1255,But you do not deny that North Korea 's nuclear capability has increased during the presidency of George Bush /?
1256,Well North Korea says that it has a nuclear weapons capability /.
1257,and we believe that it has produced that over the last several years /.
1258,and that 's why we 've put in place this policy designed to take it away from them /.
1259,And if we can have the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement implemented it will do just that /.
1260,It will effectively de-nuclearize North Korea /.
1261,And so that is a good bet for the United States /.
1262,It 's obviously the goal that I think all these critics that you cite would share /.
1263,But we think we 've got a much more realistic in the real world strategy put in place to deal with that problem /.
1264,But there has been a profound change in the rhetoric certainly of the President on this subject /.
1265,Here 's the President Friday at this news conference in Chicago about North Korea /.
1266,It takes a while for a problem to fester and grow /.
1267,and then it takes a while to solve them diplomatically /.
1268,It just 's the nature of diplomacy /.
1269,Wish we could solve them overnight /.
1270,And let me go back to January of two thousand two in the President 's axis of evil speech before congress /.
1271,Let 's watch /.
1272,North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction While starving its citizens /.
1273,States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world /.
1274,By seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger /.
1275,We 'll be deliberate /.
1276,yet time is not on our side /.
1277,I will not wait on events while dangers gather /.
1278,I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer /.
1279,The United States of America will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons /.
1280,Since the President uttered those words Mister Ambassador every estimate is that North Korea has doubled its capacity to develop nuclear weapons /.
1281,And yet we 've driven forward with this policy designed to respond to all the things the President talked about back in two thousand two /.
1282,But he has been very consistent since then in putting forward the proposition that we have to oppose the human rights abuses of the government /.
1283,We have to try to draw a net around the fact that North Korea is the leading exporter of ballistic missile technology around the world The proliferator of it /.
1284,we 've done a lot to develop missile defense /.
1285,And we 've created and driven forward this diplomatic coalition designed to bring us to a victory in denying North Korea the nuclear weaponry that you talk about /.
1286,So we have been very activist /.
1287,We have followed this policy for a number of years /.
1288,Uh the President is right /.
1289,And as I said before diplomacy ca n't be measured in a snapshot /.
1290,You ca n't just say in a Sunday morning in July that somehow because we have n't come to the end of negotiations these negotiations are bound to fail /.
1291,You 've got to be very purposeful and directed in what you 're trying to do and apply the weight of your country and that of others to the test /.
1292,And that 's what we 're doing /.
1293,We have not given up on this quest to come to the end of these negotiations and put the North Koreans back into a place where they can no longer be a threat to their neighbors or to the United States /.
1294,But again it 's the tone and the rhetoric /.
1295,Let me go back and review some of the things the President has said about Kim Jong - Il of North Korea /.
1296,I loathe Kim Jong - Il /.
1297,I got a visceral reaction to this guy /.
1298,And then in two thousand four there 's a tyrant in North Korea that wants to develop a nuclear weapon /.
1299,And then this in two thousand two /.
1300,the President called him a pygmy And compared him to a spoiled child at a dinner table /.
1301,Does the President still believe that Kim Jong - Il is a tyrant a pygmy and a spoiled child /.
1302,Kim Jong - Il is a despot /.
1303,And he is someone who is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over the world /.
1304,Uh these missile tests the other day were certainly reckless /.
1305,They were provocative /.
1306,And so uh we have n't changed our opinion of the nature of the regime in North Korea /.
1307,No one in our government has /.
1308,"We are very clear - eyed about who they are , what they represent , how much they 've denied their own people the basic human rights that people should have around the world /."
1309,And we 're focused on this nuclear question as well /.
1310,So I think there 's been a lot of continuity over American policy both in the substance of the policy and in the way we 've talked about North Korea over the last several years /.
1311,And uh we 're determined to press ahead /.
1312,When the president talked about the axis of evil he said Iraq North Korea and Iran /.
1313,The United States invaded one of those countries Iraq /.
1314,Some now make the case that Iran and North Korea took from that the following lesson that if you develop a nuclear bomb and have a strong military you will not be invaded by the US /.
1315,And both of those countries have clearly miscalculated their own situation /.
1316,Now the North Koreans felt I guess that by testing these ballistic missiles they would somehow put themselves in a position of greater weight in the negotiations /.
1317,They 've miscalculated because you 've seen very tough statements from the Chinese and the Russians and the South Koreans and the Japanese against what they 've done /.
1318,and you see momentum building in the UN security council toward a very tough chapter seven resolution against them /.
1319,The Iranians have miscalculated /.
1320,They thought that they could divide the United States from both our European allies and from Russia and China /.
1321,But we 've been able to craft a major and united coalition of all those countries /.
1322,And we 've essentially given the Iranians a clear choice /.
1323,And you 'll see a lot of this unfold this week both in Europe when Secretary Rice meets with her counterparts on Wednesday at the GA summit in St. Petersburgh At the end of the week when the president is there /.
1324,the Iranians are going to have to choose /.
1325,Negotiations with us after they suspend their nuclear programs or further action in the Security Council /.
1326,So I do n't think either of these countries is on the offensive /.
1327,Frankly I think both of these countries are rather cornered and isolated /.
1328,There are very few countries defending them /.
1329,and they 're running out of options /.
1330,So we think this policy of patient diplomacy and of crafting multilateral coalitions to tighten the pressure around them is going to work /.
1331,And it 's the right way to go clearly for the United States /.
1332,we want to exhaust diplomatic means before we consider other means /.
1333,Based on our experience in Iraq particularly with our emphasis on the weapons of mass destruction that did not materialize John Deutch the former head of the CIA offered this observation /.
1334,the next time military intervention is judged necessary to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction for example North Korea there will be skepticism about the quality of our intelligence /.
1335,Do you agree with that /?
1336,I do n't /.
1337,not in the case of North Korea not in the case of Iran /.
1338,Tim I 've been to Europe twenty times over the last fourteen months to talk to the Europeans and the Russians and Chinese about Iran for instance /.
1339,There 's not a single person at the higher levels of those government who does n't believe Iran is trying to create a nuclear weapons capability /.
1340,There is n't a single person in the governments of China or Russia or South Korea or Japan who does n't believe that North Korea is bent on building up its nuclear capability /.
1341,There is no argument in the real world today about what these two countries Iran and North Korea are trying to do /.
1342,There is no argument remotely similar to what we went through in two thousand and two and three with our European allies over Iraq /.
1343,In fact we are now tightly knit up with these countries /.
1344,And if you look at what the French German and British governments are saying as well as the Russian and Chinese governments about whether or not these countries are intending to create a nuclear weapons capability they agree with our assessment /.
1345,So I do n't agree at all that we 're somehow limited in what we can do and limited in our effectiveness because of the disagreements that we had over WMD in Iraq /.
1346,Let me conclude with comments by Bill Crystal the editor of Weekly Standard /.
1347,he used to work for Vice President Dan Quail /.
1348,North Korea is firing missiles /.
1349,Iran is going nuclear /.
1350,Somalia is controlled by radical Islamists /.
1351,Iraq is n't getting better /.
1352,and Afghanistan is getting worse /.
1353,I give the President a lot of credit for hanging tough on Iraq /.
1354,but I am worried that it has made them too passive in confronting the other threats /.
1355,Have a preoccupation with Iraq allowed North Korea and Iran to go forward with their nuclear programs and limited our options /?
1356,Well I strongly disagree with that criticism from Bill Crystal /.
1357,And I disagree for one reason /.
1358,We have a very strong and active government /.
1359,from the Pentagon from the State Department the White House Treasury we are focused on all these problems /.
1360,We created over the last fifteen months a major international coalition to corner the Iranian government And to isolate them /.
1361,And that 's been a diplomatic success over the last several months /.
1362,We 've now got this six party talk framework we hope coming back together /.
1363,and certainly the five countries are united /.
1364,Uh Secretary Rumsfeld was in Afghanistan this morning /.
1365,and Secretary Rice was there ten days ago /.
1366,and we 're giving that government president government all the support it can get /.
1367,We are a government that can operate /.
1368,and we have to operate in every part of the world /.
1369,We 're a global superpower /.
1370,We have tremendous resources at our disposal /.
1371,and frankly we 've got a first class military and a first class diplomatic effort /.
1372,and we can certainly take on all these issues and be successful simultaneously /.
1373,And we will be watching /.
1374,Ambassador Nicholas Burns we thank you for sharing your views /.
1375,Thanks Tim /.
1376,Coming next the view of three former Clinton Administration officials who spent years dealing with the North Korea problem former Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter chief State Department negotiator now at the Georgetown University Robert Gallucci And former US ambassador to the UN now Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson /.
1377,They are all right here next only on Meet The Press /.
1378,And we are back /.
1379,Welcome all /.
1380,Governor Richardson should the United States negotiate directly one on one with North Korea /?
1381,Yes it should /.
1382,Uh our policy so far is not working /.
1383,Uh what you have is North Korea has quadrupled its enriched plutonium since two thousand and two /.
1384,Uh the six party talks are going nowhere /.
1385,We should talk directly to the North Koreans to discuss what is next /.
1386,They need to dismantle their nuclear weapons /.
1387,they need to destroy their missile capability /.
1388,The only way to do that in my judgment is face to face talks at a level of Christopher Hill /.
1389,He is a competent diplomat /.
1390,Uh the successes we 've had with the North Koreans have been through direct engagement When I got some pilots out of North Korea When Bob Gallucci negotiated the agreed framework /.
1391,Secretary Albright close to having an agreement on reducing or terminating their missiles /.
1392,What North Korea is seeing right now is Iran getting a nuclear reactor /.
1393,They see Iran getting a nuclear fuel cycle that is assured economic incentives /.
1394,On the other hand what they want to see is treated with respect direct talks with the United States /.
1395,But also they want to see an effort by the United States to give them the recognition that they feel they deserve /.
1396,I do n't believe they do /.
1397,They are a desolate isolated regime /.
1398,But right now our policy is not working /.
1399,It makes sense to talk directly with North Korea /.
1400,But would n't the world then say oh I see /.
1401,you test a missile on the fourth of July /.
1402,you get the US attention /.
1403,and you bring them to the bargaining table /.
1404,Our policy right now does not work /.
1405,Look where we are right now /.
1406,Uh Asia is destabilized /.
1407,We are trying to outsource our foreign policy to China /.
1408,I believe China is not necessarily interested in helping us on North Korea /.
1409,They do n't want to see a bunch of refugees go into their country /.
1410,I believe that China is a competitor /.
1411,They control a lot of our debt /.
1412,Right now we do not have leverage over China /.
1413,The best effort in my judgment is face to face talks /.
1414,Hard negotiating /.
1415,Get that agreement that was uh signed in September that North Korea has not abided to /.
1416,A time table for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons /.
1417,Efforts to set up bench marks in exchange for that armistice agreement where we do n't attack North Korea /.
1418,They get economic assistance /.
1419,But our objective should be firm /.
1420,To get them to dismantle their nuclear weapons /.
1421,The best way to do it is face to face talks /.
1422,If the President now changed his course wo n't the headlines be Bush blinks /?
1423,No /.
1424,I believe the headlines would be Bush deals realistically with North Korea /.
1425,He reverses a policy that is not working /.
1426,Ambassador Gallucci do you agree with that /?
1427,Just about entirely /.
1428,uh I have nothing against the idea of the six party talks something Nick pounded on /.
1429,Uh uh the virtue of having all these parties in Asia engaged that 's /-
1430,it 's true /.
1431,it is their problem as well as ours /.
1432,But the fact is it has n't worked /.
1433,And to make the form more important than a substance To care more about whether we have six parties meeting together than whether we stop the accumulation of plutonium is absurd in my view /.
1434,You 'd have some conditions /.
1435,you had said prior to the missile test that if they took that missile off the launch pad you 'd negotiate face to face /.
1436,Now that they 've launched it would you have any conditions before you went back to the table one on one /?
1437,This is kind of a rule I think that you really try hard not to negotiate with a gun or missile to your head /.
1438,And I think a decent interval now and some work at the United Nations is the appropriate thing to do /.
1439,But I think we 're taking a view from thirty thousand feet right now /.
1440,what should the administration do /?
1441,It needs to find a way to get back to the negotiating table /.
1442,And the fact that you may get a headline like the President is reversing course as indeed we have in the case of Iran that 's not so bad if you find you 're on the wrong course /.
1443,and we have been /.
1444,Ashton Carter do you agree there should be one on one direct negotiations between North Korea and the US /?
1445,No I actually think the six party talks is a perfectly appropriate forum including for us to speak directly to the North Koreans if others are at the table /.
1446,Let 's go back to the logic of the six party talks in the first place /.
1447,The reason to have everybody at the table with the North Koreans is not only that they have a stake in the outcome as well but uh in dealing with North Korea diplomacy has to have a coercive dimension /.
1448,And we do n't trade with North Korea /.
1449,we do n't recognize North Korea diplomatically /.
1450,uh there 's almost nothing we can do short of military action to apply pressure to North Korea /.
1451,We 're capable of military action /.
1452,and it 's important that that be an ingredient of course in diplomacy /.
1453,But the real levers on Kim Jong - Il are the Chinese and the South Koreans /.
1454,It is they who essentially support the regime economically and politically /.
1455,But makes sense to have them at the table /.
1456,The six party talks I totally agree with my colleagues here have produced nothing so far except a quadrupling of the amount of plutonium as ambassador Richardson said um in North Korean hands and now missile launches /.
1457,So they 've been running wild for three years or so /.
1458,Um the reason for that /-
1459,there 's a lot of blame to go around /.
1460,you have to start with the North Koreans and their own intransigence /.
1461,The Chinese and the South Koreans have not done everything that they should /.
1462,uh they 've shown the carrots /.
1463,they 've been unwilling to show the sticks that they can also wield /.
1464,I think on our side um it matters less who else is at the table than that we have our own wits about us as we sit down with the North Koreans /.
1465,And our government I believe has been divided over the last few years as the six party talks between two camps /.
1466,One camp which believes that we have to give diplomacy a try and is earnest about pursuing diplomacy with North Korea /.
1467,But there 's another camp uh in this country and I think represented in the government that believes that negotiating with the North Koreans is a fools game or is even immoral because of the nature of the regime /.
1468,I do n't agree with that view because I think it 's more immoral to let North Korea go nuclear than to try to reach a deal with North Korea /.
1469,But we have been of two minds /.
1470,and therefore I do n't think we at the table has been as effective as we might have been /.
1471,you showed some of that ambivalence in the earlier part of your segment where you see the US government saying one thing at one time and another thing at the other times /.
1472,Though it 's important that we get our story straight /.
1473,and that 's more important than who else is at the table /.
1474,You had advocated several weeks ago a preemptive military strike on the missile that was about to be tested /.
1475,Many criticize that as belligerent /.
1476,and perhaps could even trigger a North Korea response against South Korea or against Japan /.
1477,who knows /.
1478,In hindsight do you still stand by that preemptive military strike /?
1479,Well I do /.
1480,and I want to put that in some context /.
1481,By the way I would say we should have that same position today That is if the North Koreans go out to the launch pad and erect that missile and prepare to launch it we can destroy that uh before they can do it /.
1482,To do so would be a very limited military action a single bomb a single cruise missile /.
1483,the north Koreans are n't going to start a war in response uh to that kind of action /.
1484,And to those that think that 's too much I can only say where are you going to draw a line in the sand with North Korea /?
1485,At some point we have to draw a line in the sand and defend it /.
1486,We say things are intolerable /.
1487,we say they 're unacceptable /.
1488,and then we tolerate and accept /.
1489,former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and I thought long and hard about this /.
1490,and we thought that this was a relatively nonprovocative way to draw a line in the sand with North Koreans /.
1491,Now I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction also /.
1492,you may say there 's risk in this action /.
1493,but I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction as well letting North Korea go nuclear /.
1494,Governor Richardson well how do you think the North Koreans would react if we took out their test missile /?
1495,Well I respectfully disagree with Assistant Secretary Carter there /.
1496,But at least he 's got a new idea which the administration does not put forth /.
1497,"I think if we are seriously attacked or threatened , that missile which was a test was geared to the United States or to our allies we have allied responsibilities with South Korea or Japan /. /."
1498,Uh you do take that step /.
1499,but the fact is that you risk uh the uh North Koreans shooting missiles at South Korea /.
1500,and we 've got thirty seven thousand American forces at the DMZ /.
1501,Uh but Tim I think another reason for the face to face talks is that there 're two issues that are separate from the six party talks that are a serious grievance in our relationship /.
1502,one is the fact that we have frozen financial assets of the North Koreans /.
1503,I believe rightly so /.
1504,but that is a separate bilateral issue /.
1505,The second is our objection to dealing with North Koreans ' request for a light water reactor Which I believe has bogged down the six party talks /.
1506,Which by the way I believe you could have a separate bilateral face to face negotiation with the United States and also continue the efforts with the six party talks because it is the South Koreans and the Japanese that are providing financial and fuel incentives /.
1507,So you ca n't cut them out /.
1508,but I think it 's essential to have face to *face private bilateral talks between United States and North Korea /.
1509,But in the end it 's a judgment of North Korean intentions /.
1510,You 'd been there five times /.
1511,you know them /.
1512,and yet a few weeks before the missile launch you said I do n't think they 're going to test /.
1513,And they did /.
1514,No Tim I said I believe that they were going to test /.
1515,I did say that /.
1516,And what I sense in my negotiations in dealing with North Koreans /-
1517,You said as days go by I do n't believe they 're going to do it /.
1518,But early on I said that they did on CBS /.
1519,Uh my point is that when you deal with North Korea you 're not dealing with individuals like you and me /.
1520,Do n't believe in compromise /.
1521,they believe in their only way or the highway /.
1522,Their view is that their cause is right /.
1523,and they 're going to wait you out /.
1524,So they 're totally unpredictable /.
1525,and I believe the only way to deal with them and we have shown that effectively in past dealings with the Clinton Administration is direct engagement To get them to curb their nuclear weapons as Bob Gallucci did /.
1526,Secretary Albright almost got a missile agreement /.
1527,Uh Jimmy Carter got uh an agreement which was later violated regrettably with the father Kim Jong - Il /.
1528,My point is that face to face discussions with the United States directly I believe is a precursor /.
1529,the continuation of the six party talks is the best way to go /.
1530,But do they keep their word /?
1531,Here 's Madeline Albright toasting Kim Jong - Il in North Korea October of two thousand /.
1532,She appeared on this program four years later /.
1533,and this was our exchange /.
1534,But did n't North Korea develop a nuclear bomb on Bill Clinton 's watch /?
1535,"No what they were doing uh as it turns out , they were cheating /."
1536,"and the reason that you have arms control agreements is that you do n't make them with your friends , you make them with your enemies /."
1537,and it is the process that is required to hold uh countries accountable /.
1538,Ambassador Gallucci you negotiated that ninety four agreement /.
1539,The North Koreans stopped processing in one plant if you will /.
1540,but we later found out that at the same time they were making uranium in another plant /.
1541,Not actually /.
1542,No that 's not what we found out /.
1543,What happened was we did do a deal /.
1544,We did stop a uh plutonium based pro-nuclear weapons program /.
1545,We made sure that eight thousand fuel rods containing around thirty kilograms enough for five nuclear weapons worth of plutonium stayed in a storage pond /.
1546,And the deal would have had the North Koreans end their nuclear weapons program /.
1547,We think they started cheating in the late nineties by getting some gas centrifuge equipment from Pakistan /.
1548,We do n't know a lot about that where it is whether the equipment has been put together /.
1549,"We think over a period of time they 'll do what the Pakistanis did , what the Iranians appear to be wanting to do and put together this gas centrifuge /."
1550,But they never got there yet /.
1551,Or we do n't think they 've gotten there yet /.
1552,But they broke their word /.
1553,They absolutely cheated /.
1554,There 's no question about that /.
1555,But really you ought to be clear here what 's happened /.
1556,There was a nuclear weapons program that was stopped /.
1557,Plutonium production was stopped /.
1558,Right /.
1559,And afterwards tragically I believe that agreement which locked them up was allowed to collapse /.
1560,And we find ourselves now with the North Koreans accumulating plutonium a bomb 's worth a year /.
1561,And freed up that plutonium that was um controlled for that period of time /.
1562,And they say they 've used it to make bombs /.
1563,we 'd have to estimate about five more /.
1564,And with each passing day I would argue to you more important than that missile that Ash would take out on the gantry if it turns up again with each passing day we 're going to find ourselves more and more closer than we were before to the day where that material could be transferred or sold to Al - Queda Presenting a threat far greater than the threat that is posed to us by nuclear weapons aboard ballistic missiles /.
1565,We can deter a country with ballistic missiles /.
1566,We know the return address /.
1567,We do /.
1568,But with a terrorist unconventional delivery your national missile defense will not be very good against United Airlines or American Airlines Or a bus or a truck /.
1569,And deterrents does n't work terribly well when an enemy values your death more than his life /.
1570,So no defense no deterrents /.
1571,we need to lock up the nuclear program /.
1572,You would not care about the ballistic missile program if they did not have the nuclear weapons program /.
1573,But you can have all the agreements you want /.
1574,if they 're going to cheat what good are they /?
1575,Madeline Albright essentially had it correct in my view /.
1576,You make a deal /.
1577,Nobody did that deal in ninety four thinking we were trusting North Koreans /.
1578,We had some transparency a measure of it /.
1579,and you verify /.
1580,We caught them cheating /.
1581,You might make another deal /.
1582,I think you should /.
1583,You ask the question you make another deal are you better off with the deal /.
1584,or are you better off without it /?
1585,If the answer to the former is yes you do the deal /.
1586,You do n't +ask I think the simple question have they fooled us before /.
1587,then do n't let them fool us again /.
1588,I do n't believe that 's the way you proceed in international affairs /.
1589,It asks a very tough question about the national security /.
1590,should we do this /?
1591,Is it better for us /?
1592,Ask for more transparency /.
1593,Insist on it /.
1594,Be tough in the negotiations Not in the formality of whether it 's six parties or it 's bilateral /.
1595,Let me show you all two presidents Bill Clinton back in nineteen ninety three George Bush ten years later talking to the North Koreans in effect /.
1596,And I 'm asking you to put your mind in place of a North Korean watching this /.
1597,President Clinton President Bush /.
1598,North Korea can not be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb /.
1599,We had to be very firm about it /.
1600,We will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea /.
1601,Ash Carter both presidents making very firm resolved statements /.
1602,if you 're in North Korean watching that knowing that you now have the potential of building eight nuclear bombs what are you thinking /?
1603,Well I 'm concerned that they 're thinking that we 're giving a new meaning to the word intolerable Because they keep doing things that we say are intolerable and then we tolerate them /.
1604,That 's why I think at some point you have to draw the line with the North Koreans /.
1605,I do think and here I agree with both of the other gentlemen you have on the show who have shown it 's possible to reach an agreement with North Korea and to get agreements that serve our interests The much maligned agreed framework as Bob Galluci pointed out without that agreed framework North Korea by all the calculations of the experts would now have fifty nuclear weapons /.
1606,So we were better off with the agreement than without it /.
1607,It is possible to reach agreement with the North Koreans But not when they see the kind of footage that you uh showed Which is uh uh uh Americans drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back from that line And drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back /.
1608,I think our diplomacy has to have carrots in it but it has to stand somewhere /.
1609,and as I suggested earlier I think the missile tests are a good place to take a stand /.
1610,Governor Richardson draw a line in the stand and step back /.
1611,the North Koreans watch that /.
1612,they observe that /.
1613,they know what their own has been /.
1614,How do you have any strength in negotiating with people like that /?
1615,The North Koreans in my dealings with them they care more about form than they do substance /.
1616,In your earlier segment you showed president Bush calling him a tyrant /.
1617,But then later he called him Mister Kim Jong - Il /.
1618,I was in North Korea when that happened /.
1619,The North Koreans were delighted because they felt they 'd been treated with respect /.
1620,They care deeply about protocol /.
1621,And this is another reason why I think for a relatively cheap price a face to face negotiation at the level of Chris Hill who again is very competent I believe would set the stage for a final agreement at the six party talks Which is essential Which is basically a good agreement /.
1622,In exchange for North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons its missiles they get an armistice agreement where they are not attacked /.
1623,they get food fuel energy assistance /.
1624,Security assurances we will not topple their regime /.
1625,That 's right /.
1626,yeah that 's right /.
1627,that 's in that September agreement that Chris Hill negotiated /.
1628,My point is if it 's just going to be a face to face meeting that serves as a precursor that also deals with this frozen assets issue which has directly hit the North Korean regime cause it controls the foreign expenditures of Kim Jong - Il and you deal with this light water reactor especially now after we 've promised it to Iran and economic incentives to Iran I think the timing is right for this new stage of direct negotiation /.
1629,Ambassador Galluci based on your experience do you believe the North Koreans would give up their nuclear program give up their nuclear bombs which they believe in their mind is an insurance policy against an American invasion for economic assistance light water reactors /?
1630,At the end of the day I do n't know /.
1631,Um but that leaves me to conclude since I really do n't know that it 's a good idea to find out /.
1632,It 's a good idea it was in nineteen ninety four to do a deal with the North that required them to give up the program /.
1633,We did that /.
1634,and for a period of years we were in a position to monitor that closely /.
1635,and they did give it up /.
1636,Indeed you can make an argument that while the centrifuge program with the Pakistanis is clearly cheating was n't yet a genuine nuclear weapons program had n't produced anything and probably still has n't produced anything /.
1637,"So you have the possibility if the North Koreans are thinking the way they may be thinking that they need one or the other , they need either nuclear weapons to deter the United States from regime change or they need a relationship with us that makes it unnecessary for them to have nuclear weapons /."
1638,The only way to find out whether they 'll ultimately give up those weapons is to do a deal /.
1639,We hear so much talk about Kim Jong - Il tyrant spoiled child /.
1640,others have said madman /.
1641,you 've been in that country five times /.
1642,who is he /?
1643,What is he /?
1644,Well I 've never met him /.
1645,I met the number two in command /.
1646,He is the entire nation /.
1647,he is basically a cult of personality /.
1648,He runs everything /.
1649,He knows everything that 's happening /.
1650,All power flows through him /.
1651,Uh what that causes unfortunately is an isolated North Korea /.
1652,His people are in terrible shape economically /.
1653,I been there five times /.
1654,I think I 've seen one tractor /.
1655,I see people weak and drawn out /.
1656,they look like they need nourishment /.
1657,A lot of people are starving there /.
1658,They have human rights violations /.
1659,He is a mercurial character /.
1660,But I think he 's crazy like a fox /.
1661,He is not somebody that is uh out of his mind /.
1662,he may be totally unpredictable isolated /.
1663,but he 's calculating /.
1664,and he 's used the Fourth of July /.
1665,every time he feels he 's backed down he moves and does something irrational /.
1666,Uh he shoots missiles off /.
1667,he 's done it twice /.
1668,He cancels agreements /.
1669,he gets the nuclear inspectors out in two thousand and two /.
1670,This is the way he operates /.
1671,And what we should do is take advantage of his vulnerability /.
1672,He also is vulnerable in the sense that the country is weak economically /.
1673,it desperately needs an elimination of sanctions /.
1674,they need food electricity /.
1675,He 's realistic too I believe /.
1676,Bill Richardson Robert Gallucci Ashton Carter thank you all for a very sobering but important discussion /.
1677,"Coming next , President Bush celebrated his sixtieth birthday this week /."
1678,And thirty one years ago on Meet The Press then president Gerald Ford talked about being sixty and serving as president /.
1679,Coming up right here on Meet The Press /.
1680,And we 're back /.
1681,Two presidential birthdays this week /.
1682,President Bush turned sixty last Thursday /.
1683,And this Friday former president Gerald Ford will be ninety three years old /.
1684,Our thirty - eighth president talked about age health and the presidency right here thirty one years ago /.
1685,Mr. President in the early days of the republic the American people took great chances on young men in the presidency /.
1686,Now here we are looking at seventy six /.
1687,and most of the leading candidates are old geezers like me in their sixties /.
1688,Now we seem to have misplaced a generation here somewhere /.
1689,is the system out of phase /.
1690,what explains this /?
1691,I think age is a state of mind and obviously a state of health /.
1692,I 'm in the early sixties /.

1708,"And in following up on the situation in Lebanon , we are joined by our correspondent there , Mohammed Gharib ."
1709,"Mohammed , to begin with , uh , and after the latest statements by Fouad Siniora and also the address given by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah to the opposition and to all the Lebanese , has the political debate between the authorities and the opposition entered a phase of dangerous disclosures in your opinion ?"
1710,"Well , yeah , this is apparently the case yeah , Laure ."
1711,"But , yeah , the doors of dialogue , in all cases so far as the two sides are saying , remain open ."
1712,Umm .
1713,"Yeah , but the opposition in return , I mean , yeah , says that any dialogue uh , uh , at least if , yeah , yeah , it takes place between the two sides , will only be alongside the popular opinion ."
1714,"That is , the opposition so far is saying that the street is the main path to , yeah , yeah , changing the government ."
1715,"And here , I have to point out that there is a fallacy , it seems that the media people --"
1716,"the opposition is so far at the stage of demanding a change in the government and not the toppling of the government , which means that it is demanding a national unity government , yeah , yeah , or a change in the government through , yeah , yeah , I mean , yeah , keeping Prime Minister Siniora as Prime Minister and some of the current ministers , provided that , I mean , an agreement is reached to add some ministers to this current government ."
1717,Yes .
1718,"Well , Mohammed , uh , there is little hope , uh , on the issue of dialogue ."
1719,"Ah undoubtedly ah a very hasty project , especially that the Hebrew State tried to implement this project alone , from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea ."
1720,"And it was proved to them with certainty that the project is ineffective economically , as it will cost one and a half billion dollars ."
1721,"So they tried using their well - known means to transfer this project to another agency to implement it and finance it , while they reap the fruits from it ."
1722,"Aha , aha ."
1723,"They have many goals ah for such a project , the most important of which is to build one hundred new settlements they have been planning to establish in the Negev ."
1724,Ah .
1725,"But now the fear is that they plan to build them across the extension of the new canal line from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea under various headers , including the headers ah of development and architecture and ah establishing new settlements ."
1726,"And since the subject has become open in Jordan for everyone , there is no guarantee that the new construction projects that would be established on this line might reach the hands of the Zionists ."
1727,Aha .
1728,"And they might repeat the story as they started it in Palestine by building settlements , and the eastern mountains will become occupied to the Dead Sea and Araba Valley , occupied by the Zionists ."
1729,"Aha , aha ."
1730,"This project is extremely dangerous , except --"
1731,"would n't it also contribute to completely connect the Palestinian and Jordanian economy to the Israeli I mean , what generates from it , may be , of demographic , economic and development projects ."
1732,"Yes , more than this , I say ah this project is one of the American - Israeli projects in the region which aim in the end at incorporating ah Israel in the Jordanian society and in the Arab society ah and marketing it in this way ."
1733,"Huge tremendous joint projects ah ah that guarantee the security and stability of the region as it is said , but they will bring us very big losses ."
1734,Aha --
1735,"This project has engineering damages , environmental damages , military damages and political damages on Jordanian society ."
1736,"May , you made reference at the beginning of this meeting to the butcher child or the Turbini in Egypt ."
1737,What are the details ?
1738,"Well , he is nicknamed , uh , uh , like this , Turbini , and he is the leader of a murderous gang in Egypt , and he has chosen the railroad tracks as the stage for his crimes ."
1739,"In any case , we selected from the Qatari newspaper Al - Watan , uh , Amal , an article entitled The Fourth Class in Egypt : the Street Children by Habashi Rushdi , and he discusses , uh , the causes of the appearance of such gangs and such children , uh , in Egypt ."
1740,"The writer , uh , says that this class , the Fourth Class , is not from families like the three traditional classes , and their armies , who live in the open air also live in a wilderness of ethical values , so there is no discipline , and no upbringing ."
1741,And what is striking in this matter is that it is an extension of the class of poor people who live in chaotic neighborhoods that are never reached by the helping hand of the government .
1742,"And only as a reminder , May , the streets of Egyptian cities encompass two million children who are runaways from their families , according to the latest statistics ; a very large number , May ."
1743,"yes , you know , he also says , uh , the author , that the Egyptian street , uh , abandons those with apathy to unknowingly create the most hardened criminals , whose crimes will soon make the headlines of the events pages of the newspapers ."
1744,"He goes on , By putting the underlying origin of the , uh , street children class in Egypt under the microscope , you will find that one of the most dangerous reasons behind their growth is the chaotic migration from the countryside to the cities , and to a certain extent , the ruralization of the cities and the urbanization of the countryside ."
1745,And --
1746,"Yes , the unfortunate thing too in all of this , May , is that millions among the wealthy are lost in deep sleep while there are millions of children out in the streets ."
1747,"Uh , yes , well , and uh , also here the author says : What is required is not for the police to put these children in youth shelters for them to escape and go back to the streets , because the children have searched by themselves for freedom they did not have in their families , so they resorted to the streets , so do not save their lives by using the police , but through social fathers and mothers who will return them to their families and provide their families with security and safety and correct the life of every child among them ."
1748,"Yes , okay , Sir the report called for dialog with Syria and Iran , but Bush doubted neighboring countries ' taking part in the talks at an international conference to support Iraq ."
1749,Does n't this contradict the administration 's approach to dealing with the Baker - Hamilton report ?
1750,"Yes , first let me explain ."
1751,There is a call for an international conference and there is a call for a regional conference .
1752,"the international conference , it appears that the Bush administration is not encouraged and is not enthusiastic about it ."
1753,Abdul Aziz Al - Hakim expressed this when he was in Washington this position as did Iraqi President Talabani .
1754,But what is striking is that there is a possibility uh for a call for a regional conference .
1755,"In my opinion , this , uh , is being encouraged by Washington and perhaps through this conference , there will be a way in for , uh , the United States of America to talk to Syria and Iran ."
1756,Syria and Iran will of course be involved in this regional conference should it be held and I do n't think it would be wise and it would not be objective not to invite them to a conference dealing with Iraq 's regional neighbors .
1757,The question is about the American position .
1758,Will Washington take this conference as a way of initiating a dialog with Syria and Iran or will it content itself with Syria and Iran 's participation being simply the outer limits or upper ceiling for talks with Syria and Iran at this stage ?
1759,"Yes , from Washington , Mr. Subhi Ghandour , director of the Arab Dialog Center , thank you very much ."
1760,"Um , well , we also want to know , uh , in Britain , including its media and also the people , what kind of attitude they really have toward this incident ."
1761,Has the incident raised any worries locally regarding security .
1762,"Um , it 's fair to say that the British media is giving a lot of attention to the matter ."
1763,"Recently , the large newspapers , the Times , Britain 's , uh , BBC , uh , this , the major media , we should say , uh , uh , have all devoted a lot of space to this matter ."
1764,"Um , the reaction of Britain 's political community toward the incident , eh , can also be said to be very , um , er , er , sharp ."
1765,"So , uh , one is that at the time , um , Britain very quickly summoned , um , the Russian , um , ambassador to Great Britain , uh , to ask that they promptly provide related information and , um , cooperation in the investigation over this affair ."
1766,"Secondly , eh , um , the British Home Secretary Reid , eh , he has especially formed an investigation team , and , wants to assess together with experts the incident 's , um , um , possible effects on the British public ."
1767,"So today , the 30th , well , the home secretary , eh , also need to explain this matter to the British parliament , eh , to the MPs , and undergo , um , questioning by the MPs ."
1768,"Well , Professor Ji , uh , what position and task has North Korea brought with it when it came to participate in the six - party talks this time ."
1769,"I think , this , North Korea 's consideration may include such two perspectives , eh , the short - term and the long - term considerations ,"
1770,"From the short - term perspective , eh , it still mainly wants to relieve its current pressure and resolve the issue of the two sanctions ."
1771,One is the US financial sanctions ; the other is the sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council Resolution 1718 .
1772,Uh-huh .
1773,"Well , from the long - term perspective , the purpose , um , of North Korea 's participation in the six - party talks , eh , is also to resolve issues of its concern through the process , eh , of denuclearization of the peninsula ."
1774,"This , there may be , er , quite a number of concerns , yet the most important one remains the security concern , an issue of its relations with the US ."
1775,Uh-huh .
1776,"Well , what needs to be emphasized here is that prior to , this , this session of talks , North Korea has repeatedly stressed that it is already a nuclear country now ."
1777,"So in the future , the issue of the nuclear - free peninsula , uh , will not be merely an issue of , this , North Korea 's nuclear abandonment itself but will also include the issue of disarmament on the entire peninsula ."
1778,Yeah .
1779,"You just said , ah , secondly , we need to look at the new products , and thirdly , look at the new technology ."
1780,"Uh , yes , I have also heard of such a professional voice , that there is not a lot of new technology in the Beijing car show this time ."
1781,I believe this can be seen dialectically .
1782,Yes .
1783,"Ah , eh , for any company to participate in an exhibition , first , its chief purpose in participating in this exhibition is to enter this market ."
1784,"Within a period of time in the future , as the Chinese market , ah , with its spending trends , the direction of government policies , and the actual strength of national economic income , will all decide for the enterprise what type of technology and products they will showcase during this car exhibition ."
1785,"So if we were to rate the Beijing Auto Show with other A - level exhibitions in the world , there was indeed a technological difference ."
1786,This is an objective fact .
1787,"But on the other hand , looking at the future of China 's consumer market , I think the new technology brought to this car show is sufficient for us Chinese who are in the auto industry to learn , eh , to catch up and to surpass ."
1788,"Um , I think that the police should all have their own district of jurisdiction ."
1789,Uh-huh .
1790,"If he 's going to leave your , this , district of jurisdiction , there might be some problems when making an arrest ."
1791,"It wo n't be as , this , convenient as in your own jurisdiction ."
1792,"Ah , it 'll be troublesome ."
1793,"Yes , yes , yes ."
1794,What do you do when you encounter such a situation .
1795,I would have the security guards follow him and conceal myself well .
1796,"I myself , eh , am a plain - clothes policeman , so I would carry my work ID and wait somewhere he would show up ."
1797,Uh-huh .
1798,Do n't move .
1799,"I took out my work ID from my pocket , see , I 'm a policeman ,"
1800,I am the local regional police officer here .
1801,"Well , I am the regional police officer for the something , something police post controlled in the West End ."
1802,What are you doing here .
1803,I 'm not doing anything .
1804,That 's not right .
1805,One look at you tells me you 're up to no good .
1806,"Uh , I 've been watching you ."
1807,"You 've been eyeing that lady 's pocket , that satchel ."
1808,Are you planning to steal it .
1809,Are you carrying a knife .
1810,I 'm not carrying a knife .
1811,not good enough .
1812,I have to search you .
1813,So I quickly searched him .
1814,There is a technique to this .
1815,Doing the search I verified that he was carrying a tool used for criminal acts .
1816,"At this point , I did n't stop ."
1817,My eyebrows did n't move .
1818,I did n't have any feeling .
1819,Uh-huh .
1820,"ah , I quickly patted him down ."
1821,I do this everyday .
1822,"It was an awl , then I continued working downward ."
1823,"I worked downward , working toward the shoes , moving toward the pant legs , lifting the pant legs , and then taking off the shoes and pulling out the cushions inside the shoes ."
1824,"Uh-huh , nothing ."
1825,There was really nothing .
1826,"Uh-huh , well , I see that you do n't look like a good person still , right ."
1827,You see that .
1828,"It 's Haidian , Uh ."
1829,"This is my stomping ground , ah ."
1830,So go to there .
1831,"When you 're there , I do n't care what you want to do ."
1832,"Uh , go , go ."
1833,"Ha , so in this way he was eh , coaxed back ."
1834,"Yes , he was coaxed back ."
1835,"After he was coaxed back , he again took his original path ."
1836,Uh-huh .
1837,"Then when he was caught , his entire process was filmed with a DV machine ."
1838,And is he still on your turf .
1839,This version of events given on the spot will make ordinary people feel extremely happy .
1840,"Recently I 've had a , ah , feeling ."
1841,"You know I was doing that Inside Big Cases program , right ."
1842,Yeah .
1843,Yeah .
1844,"Oh , my lord !"
1845,always talking about these weird cases .
1846,"Of course , it 's possible that , this , the news media , uh , this , would deliberately search for murder , violence , and pornography ."
1847,Looking for the extraordinary .
1848,"But on the other hand , I would say that any of the cases they found , any single one , would still definitely make a big news story causing a sensation across the country , even if it happened in the US ."
1849,Uh-huh .
1850,Why were there so many .
1851,"For example , psycho serial killers ."
1852,Uh-huh .
1853,"I tell you , at the peak I had head about almost three or four cases a month ."
1854,Uh-huh .
1855,What was it all about .
1856,"Killing people by the dozen , raping the corpses , dismember the bodies , and dumping the bodies , they were mostly all the same kind of thing ."
1857,"But there were n't many in mainland China who killed their family members , were there ."
1858,They killed other people .
1859,There were very few who actually killed their own wives and children or entire families at home .
1860,Er .
1861,"There were those who killed their own relatives , uh-huh ."
1862,There were also some .
1863,"There have been too , I 've heard of them too -- I 've heard of them too -- I 've heard of them too ."
1864,"You know , recently , this , an old professor called Professor Liu Xiwei published some views in Southern Weekend , that have stirred up a huge controversy ."
1865,Yeah .
1866,Uh-huh .
1867,How are Hong Kong 's relations with the mainland .
1868,"To describe it in one sentence , in the past the economic relationship consisted of everybody making money in Hong Kong and then spending it in the mainland ."
1869,"But as the renminbi increases in value , many people today are speculating that in the future they might work hard in the mainland and then come to Hong Kong to enjoy life ."
1870,"Is such a trend possible , Professor Ha ."
1871,"Ah , I think , um , that when one works in the mainland and then comes to Hong Kong to spend money , um , there is a big difference in the wages between the two regions and maybe , um , the burden will be quite heavy , ah ."
1872,"Uh-huh , but what everybody is most concerned about is how feasible it is to link the Hong Kong dollar , ah , to the renminbi ."
1873,"many Hong Kong academics these days have come out with some calls for such a thing , oh ."
1874,What 's your opinion .
1875,"I think that , um , the market might have a wide variety of conjecture regarding , um , the Hong Kong dollar 's , ah , future and even the direction , eh , that policy on it might take , a wide variety of , er , expectations ."
1876,Right .
1877,"But , um , judging from the current situation , I personally think there is n't the basic support for linking the Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi ."
1878,Nor at the policy level is such a thing being considered .
1879,"Looking at the fundamentals , can we see why the renminbi is appreciating ."
1880,"It 's because um , China 's current account surplus is quite large , ah , processing trade and the transit trade -- both are processing trade -- and this , regular trade all have , this , surplus ."
1881,"Um , also , the growth in foreign exchange reserves has been quite rapid because the flow of money is n't outward ."

1883,"Children are left at home in the rural areas , after parents leave to work in the city ."
1884,These are called left - behind children .
1885,The parents are also forced to work in the city .
1886,"In fact , they have no alternatives but to make such a decision ."
1887,"There are 120 million farmers who work in the city all year round in China , thus creating nearly 20 million left - behind children ."
1888,I want to tell them that I miss them a lot .
1889,"Day after day and year after year , they long for love in loneliness and wait for family affection in defect ."
1890,I think that it is especially important to have emotional exchanges with the children .
1891,Visit the children more often whenever possible .
1892,-LSB- -RSB-
1893,"In September 2005 , a study report titled "" Concern for Left - behind Children "" had drawn wide public attention ."
1894,"While the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question , the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public ."
1895,"Ye Jingzhong is the assistant dean of the College of Humanities and Development at China Agricultural University , and team leader of the Left - behind Children Task Force ."
1896,"In the last two years , he has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western China , including Shaanxi , Ningxia , Hebei , and Beijing ."
1897,"Why did you pick the central and western parts of China , and not the south , to conduct this study ?"
1898,"First of all , for people who work in the city from the central and western regions um , uh , according to their educational level , they generally engage in strenuous manual labor when they leave for the city to work ."
1899,They are not in a position to bring their children to the city .
1900,"When we conducted this research study , our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents , work in the city ."
1901,", its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents ."
1902,"Therefore , we believe that whether it 's in southern or northern part , no matter which part of the country the research is conducted in , the results should be consistent ."
1903,"According to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in China now ?"
1904,This group should be the biggest in number .
1905,"Um , the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million ."
1906,"Nowadays , um , , um , many places , um , cite a figure of 120 million ."
1907,Many people quote a figure of 150 million .
1908,Let 's think about it this way .
1909,"If we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city , , at least half of them are um , married before they work in the city ."
1910,"Of course , families of these married people will usually have children ."
1911,"Moreover , they will usually have more than one child in rural areas ."
1912,So you can imagine .
1913,I believe the left - behind children group is definitely more than 10 or 20 million .
1914,"It , uh , , in my opinion , should be around 50 million ."
1915,"Of course , we have not conducted exact statistical calculations ."
1916,I believe the number of this group should be particularly large .
1917,"According to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody . Among which , single - parent custody had the highest number , accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed ."
1918,"The next one was skip - generation custody , accounting for 16.9 percent . While those who lived with relatives or were entrusted to the care of someone else made up 4.1 percent and .9 percent of the total number of left - behind children , respectively ."
1919,"According to your study , what do these left - behind children generally do with their daily life if their parents or parent work in the city ?"
1920,Different types of custody have different impacts on their life .
1921,"No doubt , , single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types ."
1922,The impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home .
1923,There is no major problem in the children 's material life .
1924,"Of course , there are many impacts in other aspects , for instance , peer socialization ."
1925,The one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody .
1926,Skip - generation custody means the grandparents look after the children .
1927,"There is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children , and there is a type called self - custody ."
1928,These three types create the biggest and the most impact .
1929,"If we want to discuss this in more detail , let 's say , the skip - generation custody ."
1930,"First , in skip - generation custody , their material life will no doubt be a lot less taken care of when compared to the usual both parents or one parent at home situation ."
1931,This is indisputable .
1932,This type of family is not as good as the others .
1933,We had an example of a child in Shaanxi province .
1934,"Um , there was a family !"
1935,This family had an older brother and a younger sister .
1936,Both parents wanted to go to the city to work .
1937,"The father went first , and later the mother wanted to go , too ."
1938,What happened to these two children ?
1939,"The grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas , grandparents also have to work in the field !"
1940,"As a result , , this mother sent , these brother and sister , to martial arts school to study ."
1941,"After they went to the martial arts school for a while , um , their mother was , um , a little worried , so she went to visit them ."
1942,She went to visit them .
1943,"When she saw them , , the girl cried to her and said , "" I really do n't want to stay here ."
1944,"I want to go home . """
1945,"Later , the mother was moved and brought , this girl home and had the grandparents look after her ."
1946,"Um , she still , ai , left him at the martial arts school ."
1947,"Um , um , after the girl returned , the mother continued to work in the city ."
1948,"When she came back one time in between work , she found that the girl 's body was dotted with red marks and red swellings ."
1949,"She then discovered ah , um , the grandparents had not washed her clothes for a very long time ."
1950,"The situation you mentioned , is it common or is it a rather extreme example , because generally , people will think that grandparents will particularly love and care about their grandchildren ?"
1951,The situation that I just mentioned regarding skip - generation custody is no doubt common .
1952,Why is it so ?
1953,You said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .
1954,It is true .
1955,It is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children .
1956,"However , for the elderly , with the difference in age and time , , their , ways of taking care and loving the children are different ."
1957,They are influenced by their own habits .
1958,"For instance , there was a child who was sick ."
1959,"Um , the grandparents asked him to take , a small pill that was made in Shaanxi ."
1960,They did not even know what it was made of .
1961,It was a local method .
1962,"Um , after all , they are different from , um , young people in this respect ."
1963,"Instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible , they are influenced by , some habits in this aspect ."
1964,", they raised this point themselves ."
1965,Another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family .
1966,""" Her father and mother are not home , so the entire family falls onto our shoulders , especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland ."
1967,"So , all I can do is to feed her and make sure that she is not cold . """
1968,"They also had to face such a reality , one that they could not resolve ."
1969,"After all , a family that had so many people in the beginning , , the parents of the children were a very important um , workforce ."
1970,Now it was down to the two grandparents .
1971,"No doubt , they could not help ."
1972,"In the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inculcation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet ."
1973,"Farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school ."
1974,"Originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education ."
1975,"However , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more ."
1976,"During this period , the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children ."
1977,This pair of unavoidable contradictions has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious .
1978,You have seen many kinds of left - behind children .
1979,Was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ?
1980,", um , there was a child in Ningxia whose name was Yao Zhengang ."
1981,"This child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school ."
1982,What impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents .
1983,He felt particularly lonely and especially wanted his father to come back .
1984,He said that he was sick one time .
1985,"His father worked in Guyuan , about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home ."
1986,"After his father learned that he was very sick , he ran back to the village right away ."
1987,"After he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on his back and carry him to the town to see a doctor ."
1988,He just carried him like that without saying a word .
1989,"When the doctor in the town took a look and told him that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county ."
1990,"When Yao Zhengang told us what happened , he said , "" My father had never bought me so many tasty foods before ."
1991,"On that day , he bought me a lot of tasty food while we were in the county , but he did not eat any himself . """
1992,I thought about this at that time .
1993,"After I heard this incident , I particularly understood what was in the mind of Yao Zhengang 's father ."
1994,He might have felt especially guilty toward his child .
1995,"What he felt was that "" I go out to work and leave my child home . """
1996,"He said that his child had also said , "" When he was at home , he always encouraged me . """
1997,"He would say , "" No problem . You work hard and get a better grade next time , "" when I had low grades ."
1998,"If he could receive many , such encouragements , he would not have um , um , disliked school sometimes ."
1999,He does not want to go to school now .
2000,"However , in his example , I could imagine what went through his father 's mind at that time ."
2001,I think that he felt very guilty toward his child .
2002,"Therefore , I can feel that um , um , parents who work in the city also have no alternative ."
2003,They are forced into making such decisions .
2004,"Um , there was also this child ."
2005,"There was a child , a girl in Xixiang county , Shaanxi province ."
2006,"Um , when I asked , "" What do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ? "" She did not answer ."
2007,She went home to get a small box .
2008,There was a small finger inside the box .
2009,This was a very terrifying incident .
2010,What was the small finger all about ?
2011,"What happened was that when her um , parents left to work in the city , her grandparents looked after her ."
2012,They had a cellar at home and inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay .
2013,"When she went downstairs to play by herself , an accident happened ."
2014,"Her grandparents said , "" We ca n't help ."
2015,"We ca n't keep an eye on her all the time . """
2016,", before they went to work in the city , they could watch her and forbade her to go down to the cellar ."
2017,He had told her not to do that before .
2018,"However , I said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control ."
2019,That was why she turned this way .
2020,-LSB- -RSB-
2021,"This is Ruangang village , Bocang town , Yi county , Hebei province ."
2022,"Among the 303 households in the village , one - third of the families have people who work in the city ."
2023,More than half of the children in the village are left - behind children .
2024,Most of the children 's parents are in the southern part of the country .
2025,"Many people want to save some travel expenses and earn some more money , so it is very common for them not to return home for a year or two ."
2026,Life is so vast .
2027,Life is an ocean wherever life exists .
2028,It has been six years since 14 - year - old Jiang Beiwen was sent by his parents to live with his maternal grandfather in Ruangang village .
2029,His parents rely on selling rice in Guangzhou to support their child 's education .
2030,They live a very hard life .
2031,Little Beiwen has not seen them once in the past six years .
2032,"Oh , I see so many children here who can turn for comfort in their parents ' arms !"
2033,"Ah , I envy them ."
2034,"So , I also , want to be able to turn to comfort in my parents ' arms ."
2035,I was at school the time I missed my mother the most .
2036,Uh huh .
2037,We had a market !
2038,"Oh , every day , there were parents who bought things for their oh , sons and daughters ."
2039,I also wish that my parents could buy me things .
2040,I envied them very much .
2041,That was when I missed my mother the most .
2042,This is Jiang Beiwen 's favorite photo .
2043,"It was taken with his father six years ago , before he sent him to live with his maternal grandfather ."
2044,He was only eight years old at that time .
2045,The only connection that little Beiwen has with his parents now is to talk on the phone with them once a week .
2046,"In his opinion , affection among family members is something unreachable ."
2047,How often can your mother call you ?
2048,"Uh , once a week !"
2049,What do you talk about ?
2050,I will talk about my studies and life .
2051,My schoolwork was not quite good when I first came !
2052,My mother scolded me in the beginning when my schoolwork was poor .
2053,She said that I was losing honor for not doing well at school !
2054,"Then I cried and after that , my mother cried , too ."
2055,"Since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children ."
2056,"While for temporary custodians , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure the children have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children ."
2057,The survey found that 36.7 percent of the children had never been to their parents ' workplace .
2058,8.2 percent of the parents almost never contacted their children .
2059,21.4 percent of the parents contacted their children less than once a month .
2060,"Since their parents are absent , how can these children communicate and exchange with their parents ?"
2061,"Our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone ."
2062,"However , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so ."
2063,What could they talk about in three minutes ?
2064,I think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes .
2065,"Of course , we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations ."
2066,What did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ?
2067,"What touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of the children 's conversations with their parents was to ask about their safety and not other things , such as how much they had earned ."
2068,"As for the content of the parents ' conversations with their children , first , it was school ."
2069,Whether they were good and how their schoolwork was .
2070,"Second , it was whether they obeyed their custodians and what they ate and things like that ."
2071,"Uh , as for safety matters , in fact , they could not have any emotional exchange ."
2072,"We know that sometimes when we talk on the phone , even a pause is a need for emotional exchange ."
2073,"However , the parents may not have realized this ."
2074,"For instance , the child has stopped talking ."
2075,He stops talking because he needs to pause to consider how to say what is in his mind .
2076,"The parents may not have realized this point , so they hang up the phone immediately ."
2077,"Of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ?"
2078,"In many cases , it was because they worried about the charge ."
2079,", many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone ."
2080,"However , um , they considered that um , one thing , sometimes they did not have a telephone at home ."
2081,It was very difficult for children to borrow the phone from their neighbors .
2082,"Second , um , they considered that they needed money to make a phone call ."
2083,"Some children told me , "" I secretly called my parents when my custodians were not home . """
2084,The children have a great need for this type of telephone exchange .
2085,Do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ?
2086,"Um , um , we conducted a survey on this question ."
2087,We were very surprised to find that 40 percent of the left - behind children had no idea what jobs their parents held away from home .
2088,How could that be possible ?
2089,How could that be possible ?
2090,"We interviewed some left - behind children , their custodians , and the people who work in the city ."
2091,Why would n't the children know what they did ?
2092,"First , we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city ."
2093,"However , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coalmines , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs ."
2094,"Thus , I believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of their job ."
2095,Why do they do that ?
2096,It is because they are afraid that their children will worry .
2097,"Second , , parents , especially fathers , who work in the city have a particularly lofty image in the children 's mind ."
2098,Maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of their job or tell them what they do .
2099,"They , do not want to destroy the lofty image of themselves in the child 's mind ."
2100,"At noon , the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in the field and did not come home ."
2101,Jiang Beiwen has to make lunch for himself .
2102,This happens to him very often .
2103,He could look after himself since he was nine .
2104,"What work are you going to do today , other than cooking ?"
2105,"Uh , I will do the dishes after I finish eating ."
2106,"If it is Sunday when I am free , I will , also do some farm work ."
2107,What kind of work ?
2108,"Uh , I will hoe the field , uh , when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops , I will help do some work ."
2109,Do you still remember your mother 's cooking ?
2110,"Uh huh , I do ."
2111,It was especially tasty .
2112,"Now , the most I want to know is , my parents ' health ."
2113,Why do you want to know about that ?
2114,It is because I care about my parents very much .
2115,"I think about their work because I know that they work in the city because of me , so I care about them a lot ."
2116,"They will be worn out from working in the city , working in the city to make money ."
2117,"I believe it is also because of me , so I care about their health a lot ."
2118,"Because of you , why is it because of you ?"
2119,"Because if they did n't have me , I think they uh , would be a lot more , relaxed when they worked ."
2120,"Then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? Or go to the city with them ?"
2121,"In regard to this , first , , children all want their parents to come back to live with them ."
2122,"However , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city , to live in the city ."
2123,"However , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to the city ."
2124,We also asked them why they did not want to go to the city .
2125,This was also very surprising to us .
2126,They said that the city is another world and they were especially worried .
2127,"They were afraid that once they go to the city , they will not be able to assimilate into the schools and things like that ."
2128,"Second , they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in the city ."
2129,"Their parents have to send money home , among other things ."
2130,"If they go live with them , they will add more burdens to their parents ."
2131,"If we are in the city every day , live in the city every day , we may know that oh , city life is like this ."
2132,"As for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear ."
2133,"As for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ?"
2134,"I believe when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling ."
2135,"All parents , I can say the majority of the parents , definitely want to live with their children ."
2136,"However , with the reality that they have to face , I believe that they can not solve this problem ."
2137,"Of course , we know what the reality is ."
2138,"First , their families are rather poor to begin with ."
2139,Only the lower - middle class will leave the rural areas and work in the city .
2140,They have to make money to support the family .
2141,They will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city .
2142,"Nonetheless , I believe there are also many other reasons ."
2143,They also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city .
2144,They have to find a place to live .
2145,All these are problems that they need to resolve .
2146,The problems they face are too many .
2147,"If the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high ."
2148,"Since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need ."
2149,Many parents are unable to bring their children with them .
2150,What would you tell your parents if you could see them now ?
2151,I want to tell them that I miss them very much .
2152,"Judging from the surface , is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non-left - behind children ?"
2153,It is hard to tell from the surface .
2154,Why is it so ?
2155,"For these children , it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city ."
2156,"For example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already ."
2157,"In this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect ."
2158,"However , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn ."
2159,"They had very strange um , um , temperaments ."
2160,They did not like to speak .
2161,"There was , a child who was in the first year of junior high school ."
2162,"Um , um , he told us himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father ."
2163,He was very good at school .
2164,"However , one time we visited him , his um , family told us that he was second in his class in his examination ."
2165,"After that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed ."
2166,"Um , um , um , his language and other things became very strange ."
2167,"Um , um , we also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him ."
2168,"They said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him ."
2169,"Um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city ."
2170,"However , for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development ."
2171,This situation indeed exists .
2172,"After all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete ."
2173,I believe love is especially important .
2174,Children need love from the time they are small .
2175,"We have to understand our Chinese saying , "" The child is father to the man . """
2176,What it says is that the character that children form at a very young age will affect their entire life .
2177,Only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future .
2178,This is the case .
2179,"Therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychologically , they do not have family love ."
2180,"Um , , if the parents work in the city , these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home ."
2181,Perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love .
2182,"Under this situation , I believe , I am not sure , um , I am unwilling to imagine what mentality and character these children will develop when they grow up ."
2183,Will they believe there is love in society or not ?
2184,"Will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it ."
2185,They have never completely experienced it .
2186,"Thus , if such a large group in society does not realize that love should be , um , given or received in society , I think this is , something that I do not want to imagine ."
2187,"Despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money , they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require ."
2188,"According to the survey , more than half of the left - behind children were dissatisfied with their current life ."
2189,58 percent of the left - behind children believed that they were unhappy .
2190,Are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by themselves ?
2191,Do they understand the living conditions of their children at home ?
2192,"They thought that this was a reality that they could not um , um , face ."
2193,They were condemned to this reality .
2194,"No doubt , I think some , um , parents have not had such profound consideration ."
2195,Why do n't they ?
2196,I believe people are all the same .
2197,"If they face such an urgent need for a livelihood , their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood ."
2198,"They can not consider the deeper issue of children 's safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved , satisfied , and guaranteed ."
2199,"For example , there were two sisters who lived in a cave dwelling in Shaanxi province ."
2200,Many people whom we interviewed lived in cave dwellings .
2201,Once there was a flood .
2202,", these sisters stayed in the cave dwelling to look after the home !"
2203,This happened in the rural area .
2204,These two children were looking after the home .
2205,Their uncle saved them when the flood was almost past their bellies .
2206,Their father called later to see if they were fine .
2207,The family told him that they were fine .
2208,He did not come back after that .
2209,He did not come back to check if everything was fine .
2210,I believe the reason he did not return was that he would ponder whether he should return or not .
2211,Tomorrow 's summit meeting will bring Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat to the resort city of Sharm El - eikh .
2212,Getting both to attend was not an easy task .
2213,"The last thing President Clinton did today before heading to the Mideast is go to church -- appropriate , perhaps , given the enormity of the task he and his national security team face in the days ahead ."
2214,"We do have to try to reduce the violee and take a turn back for a period of calmness so that we can move back to a peace process , but even if the violence subsides , Israelis and Palestinians will still have to deal with an open wound -- a scar so long and so deep from these last two weeks , it may be years before there is a real effort at talking peace again ."
2215,"Both sides have almost stepped back six years in terms of their statements and attitudes , six years or more -- before the Oslo accords , when the Israelis promised land and the Palestinians promised security ."
2216,Today there is only finger pointing .
2217,Arafat deliberately launched it in order to attract the attention of the world by paying with the blood of his own people .
2218,"I urge Mr. Barak to lift the siege of Palestinians , to speak to the Palestinians as its neighbors because they are his neighbors ."
2219,"The Palestinians clearly face the greatest pressure in this summit , since the Israelis are not the only ones blaming them for the outbreak of violence ."
2220,I think we all know that Arafat is in charge of the Palestinian Authority .
2221,He has the responsibility for controlling the violence .
2222,But it may not be so easy for Arafat .
2223,"Today , thousands of Palestinians are calling for continued fighting ."
2224,Half of the Palestinian population is under the age of 14 and many have been influenced by military factions like Hamas and Hezbollah -- not by Arafat .
2225,"When you talk about Arafat and the people around him , you have to understand how young this population really is -- how volatile , how close to exploding it really is ."
2226,Almost no one seems optimistic about the future of the Mideast .
2227,That 's the heartbreak of this region says one State Department official .
2228,"Whenever you take a step forward , you are bound to be pushed way back ."
2229,"Martha Raddatz , ABC News , the State Department ."
2230,Back to the Middle East tonight .
2231,the truce brokered by President Clinton between Israelis and Palestinians allegedly is in tatters .
2232,Palestinians now talking about a battle for independence .
2233,Israel says it may abandon the peace negotiations altogether .
2234,Nine Palestinians were killed today .
2235,"More than 70 people have been wounded , mostly Palestinians , but also several Israeli soldiers ."
2236,ABC 's Bob Woodruff is in the Palestinian territories tonight .
2237,Violence ripped through almost every major Palestinian town today .
2238,The worst was in Nablus .
2239,Four Palestinians were shot and killed .
2240,"In Ramallah , thousands of Palestinians rushed the Israeli checkpoint , then faced down Israeli guns ."
2241,"From Hebron to Gaza , the wounded were carried off so fast it was difficult to count them ."
2242,"As is so often the case , much of the trouble started with funerals that escalated into fury ."
2243,"Most significant , demonstrators who had been throwing stones this week , today turned to gasoline bombs ."
2244,Israelis who had been firing rubber bullets stepped up their use of real ones .
2245,"This was supposed to be the day the truce went into effect , when both sides would call off the violence , but that clearly has not happened , and here in the streets , peace seems very unlikely ."
2246,"Tonight on Israeli television , Prime Minister Barak said we can not go on as if nothing happened , and if the demonstrations do n't stop , Barak 's spokesman said Israel will continue to use live ammunition ."
2247,"They leave no other way for us but to respond with fire , we 'll have to do this ."
2248,"Palestinian leaders said their people no longer want a cease - fire , they want their own country ."
2249,We are under occupation and subjugation .
2250,The question should be what the Hosni Mubarak are they still doing there eight years after the peace process began .
2251,It is one of the major questions that was supposed to be addressed after the stoning and shooting had stopped .
2252,It certainly has not stopped .
2253,Not yet .
2254,"Bob Woodruff , ABC News , Ramallah ."
2255,We are going to take `` a closer look '' at the great Wind Cave in South Dakota .
2256,No easy matter .
2257,"We know caving is a popular pasttime for some Americans , a horrifying thought for others , especially anyone prone to claustrophobia ."
2258,We asked Judy Muller if she would like to do the story of a fascinating man .
2259,"She took a deep breath and said , okay ."
2260,"This wild landscape in South Dakota may evoke images of the frontier West , but the real frontier is far beneath ."
2261,Elevation plus 11 .
2262,The real pioneers are men like John Sheltons who explore underground caves .
2263,The most fascinating is the maze known as Wind Cave .
2264,"When you find one where no one has been there , you are the first person , the adrenaline is phenomenal ."
2265,He first came here as a tourist 30 years ago .
2266,He offered to map it for the Park Service .
2267,I thought would take a week or two .
2268,It 's now 30 years down the road .
2269,I 'm no closer to completing the agreement .
2270,The cave is seemingly endless .
2271,"3 miles of the cave have been surveyed , every inch logged by hand , then fed into a computer which plots every nook and cranny ."
2272,We 're only representing about 5 % of the known volume that could possibly be here .
2273,95 % of the cave is unmapped ?
2274,Yes .
2275,The first recorded discovery of the cave was in 1881 .
2276,A cowboy hunting in the area heard the sound of rushing wind .
2277,He followed it to this narrow opening .
2278,"The wind was so strong , or so the story goes , that it blew his hat off his head ."
2279,"Since then , many visitors have been drawn into this world of crystals , fossils and calcite formations known as forecast work and popcorn and rarest of all , fox work ."
2280,"Each new discovery means heading down another tight , dark hall ."
2281,Your stomach is against the floor and your back is against the wall .
2282,"As we crawled along , we found an item left by earlier explorers ."
2283,A 103 - year - old newspaper .
2284,The ultimate payoff is when they find a new chamber .
2285,"The knowledge that our lights are the first to light it up , our footprints were the first , our eyes were first to see it ."
2286,He calls it addictive .
2287,You get withdrawal .
2288,"I want to find more , something bigger or deeper ."
2289,He no longer expects to see the end of the cave in his lifetime .
2290,"That , he says , is just fine with him ."
2291,"Judy Muller , ABC News , Wind Cave National Park ."
2292,Some camera team as well .
2293,Some overseas news .
2294,"Barak , who has been forced to call national elections , offered to recognize a Palestinian state ."
2295,There 's one very difficult condition .
2296,There could be no discussion for now about who will have what status in Jerusalem .
2297,Palestinians do n't like it .
2298,"In Bethlehem , where Christians believe Jesus was born , Christmas plans have been scaled back because of the violence ."
2299,There is other news tonight overseas and at home .
2300,"While all this is going on , Mr. Clinton is overseas ."
2301,President Clinton was in Northern Ireland when he heard the Supreme Court decision .
2302,He talked to Al Gore on the phone from Belfast .
2303,"This is Mr. Clinton 's third visit to Northern Ireland , and the Irish Republic to do what he can to generate a lasting peace ."
2304,The Indonesian billionaire James Riady has agreed to pay $ 8.5 million and plead guilty to illegally donating money for Bill Clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign .
2305,He admits he was trying to influence American policy on China .
2306,"Good evening , everyone ."
2307,We begin tonight with a couple of urgent questions for the government .
2308,There 's a man on trial in New York for bombing the American embassy in Kenya two years ago .
2309,"The FBI says when they questioned him , he told them of another plot to bomb an American ship in Yemen , where the `` USS Cole '' was ultimately attacked ."
2310,"Question one , did the FBI make it clear what the man had told them ?"
2311,"Question two , did the Pentagon and the CIA get the message and do nothing about it ?"
2312,"Here 's your national correspondent , John M Wethy ."
2313,"In the days after the bombing of the American embassy in Nairobi , Mohammed Al - owhali was arrested by Kenyan authorities and interrogated by the FBI ."
2314,He told the FBI he participated in the attack under direction of terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden .
2315,ABC News has learned he also provided details of a plan to attack an American warship in Yemen .
2316,"Al - owhali said it would be a rocket attack , conducted by a Bin Laden terrorist cell , and it would come in the next few months ."

2646,"Just as he did that , that 's when you saw the child just walking just a few feet away from him but the officers were able to get the child away ."
2647,They handcuffed the man and they took him into custody .
2648,That was after he had actually barricaded himself inside that bus with the child .
2649,"So that one coming to a peaceful ending , what could have been a very gruesome situation involving that two - year - old child in Southern California ."
2650,That one is over in Long Beach .
2651,Some U.S. troops have not had a chance to call home since they were deployed for duty in `` Operation Iraqi Freedom . ''
2652,"For some wives , the kindness of strangers has eased their worries ."
2653,Beth Basin explains .
2654,Reporter :
2655,Jamie 's husband Jack was deployed a couple of weeks ago .
2656,She and her daughter Jordan often shuffle through these pictures of him taken before he left .
2657,"She has no idea where her husband is now , but thanks to a little help from a Delta flight attendant , she knew he got where he was going ."
2658,She had taken a picture of him and everything .
2659,Reporter :
2660,"Along with the picture , the flight attendant wrote a letter saying she was praying for Jack 's safe return ."
2661,The trip to Georgia was just the first leg .
2662,"He got on a flight to an undisclosed location , when Jamie got a second phone call from a flight attendant ."
2663,He asked us to call you to let you know he 's okay .
2664,And she told us that he whipped out pictures of our kids and everything and showed all the family pictures and stuff .
2665,Reporter :
2666,Jamie is not the only military wife who received a photo and letter .
2667,Her friend Anna also got one .
2668,Turns out Anna 's husband flew out on the same flight as Jack .
2669,"Although a small gesture , Anna says it 's meant a great deal ."
2670,"It made me realize that someone out there does care about my husband and the rest of the military , and it 's not all anti-war ."
2671,Reporter :
2672,"Even though neither of the women have ever met the flight attendants , they say they 'll never forget their act of kindness ."

2678,"Just go to our Website , cnn.com/wolf ."
2679,We read all of your e-mail .
2680,Much more coverage of the new Iraq and --
2681,Welcome back .
2682,We 're standing by for the White House press briefing .
2683,Ari Fleischer expected to come into the West Wing briefing room to brief reporters on a wide variety of subjects .
2684,"We 're all getting , this news in from the speech that the Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge is expected to be delivering at the international press club around 1:00 Eastern at the top of the hour ."
2685,"We 're expecting that the Homeland Security Secretary will announce , that this Iraqi lawyer , who provided the information to U.S. military authority IES has been granted asylum here in the United States , together with his wife and daughter ."
2686,"They 're currently in the Washington , D.C. area ."
2687,An official tells our justice producer Terry Frieden .
2688,So that development important .
2689,Might get more information from Secretary Tom Ridge when he delivers that speech over at the press club in the next hour .
2690,We 'll be monitoring that as well .
2691,"We also have an update on that disturbing development outside Baghdad , about 40 miles or so outside Baghdad in Fallujah where there was a shootout between U.S. troops and Iraqis who had been demonstrating there ."
2692,Karl Penhaul is joining us live on the phone with more .
2693,"First of all , Karl , how many Iraqis were killed in that incident ?"
2694,Back to the scene in Orlando Florida .
2695,"We were here moments ago where the man in the green in the forefront of the screen there , the former POW David Williams was speaking to the crowd rather emotionally and now you see he is taking down the black and white POW flag ."
2696,I wish I could tell you which site this flag was hoisted in .
2697,"We have the pictures coming in from Central Florida , News 13 ."
2698,"This is that City Hall in Orlando , now I 'm being told ."
2699,Quite an emotional scene this morning .
2700,"David Williams , one of the POWs whose face we got to know in the coverage that we saw coming from Iraq ."
2701,"Other POWs from Iraq after they were captured and released , that dramatic release that Sunday morning when they were picked up by a squadron of Marines who had wandered in a town in Baghdad and were told where they were being kept ."
2702,Dramatic rescue and then a return home .
2703,Quite an emotional experience and one of us can only imagine what it must have been like to endure .
2704,"As we said , quite an emotional moment in Orlando , Florida ."
2705,"And you see Apache helicopter pilot and his wife Michelle who was talking with us on the telephone the Sunday morning when the video came in of the rescue of the POWs and , she identified her husband and life just got better and better for her after that ."
2706,"Moving on now , in upstate New York Stock Exchange criminal charges have been filed in last month 's fraternity hazing death at Platsberg State University of New York ."
2707,11 members had been charged with negligent homicide for forcing 18 - year - old pledge Walter Dean Jenning to drink an excessive amount of water .
2708,"The fraternity also faces more than 150 charges for other hazing activities , as well ."
2709,`` Vanity Fair 's '' columnist Daniel Fair is here .
2710,"Quiting in the June edition , he describes the journey ."
2711,He said he found evidence that Hussein 's day of reckoning well overdue .
2712,Christopher Hitchens joins us from California .
2713,Good to have you with us .
2714,Thanks for having me .
2715,"Your journey , particularly to southern Iraq , what is evoked there a sense of both that you evoke is a sense of history of this regime ."
2716,Give us your insights as to what you think the future holds .
2717,Do you mean if I start with the Past ?
2718,Not at you will .
2719,Not at all .
2720,Not much of a trip .
2721,I was n't up the sharp end .
2722,I was n't taking risks .
2723,"I was n't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside Bagdad airport but I had long thought and I was in Iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , Saddam Hussein made the only self criticism ."
2724,"He said , I could either invade Kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon ."
2725,"Maybe before the weapon and then later he said , Oh , I should have got the nuclear weapon before I invaded ."
2726,"He was right about that , but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen - years war where the United States could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we 're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in `91 when it could have been finished ."
2727,"Should have taken the side of the rebels then , taken the risk of supporting a Shiite insurrection at that point , helping the Kurds , removing the regime ."
2728,Absolutely .
2729,We 'd be 11 years into nation building by now if we 'd done that .
2730,That seems to be the core of the argument .
2731,"As you point out , of course , for the fact of the matter is , the mistakes of Saddam Hussein made possible his removal from power ultimately ."
2732,"The mistakes of the United States , again , as you point out , Norman Schwarzkopf making a peace , permitting helicopters to fly ."
2733,Still hurts me to read this .
2734,"The little town I was in this southern Iraq , as far as I got , I ca n't boast of further , is where the talks took place ."
2735,We have the transcript of the meeting .
2736,"They say , Okay , we have lost this round , Do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things ? and he says , Yeah , that 's all right ."
2737,"They ask again , Are you sure they mean that ?"
2738,They ca n't believe the luck .
2739,"They use the gunships to kill , we think , not less than 50,000 inhabitants of southern Iraq and trying to do that to the Kurds , as well , so it was a knife edge ."
2740,"And it 's not just being wise after the event , I believe , to say that there was an argument in realtime between the Bush administration members ."
2741,Mr. Cheney 's the only one I know that changed his mind .
2742,"Most of those that took the view at that time , think until recently they were correct in saving Saddam Hussein ."
2743,"Of course , Mr. Cheney was in the chain of command with Swartzkopf and --"
2744,Many others .
2745,"When they made the decision not to move toward Bagdad with bad information , namely , the Republican Guard absolutely devastated ."
2746,Yes .
2747,"And , well , we know now the harvest of all that ."
2748,"It hurts to think of how many wonderful people in Iraq at the academic community , lawyers , human rights activists , civilians , intellectuals , people -- would now be alive , who have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and overflights ."
2749,"Mistakes made then , mistakes part of human experience , but now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes ."
2750,Is it your sense that the United States is on the right track ? that there is a commitment here on the part of the United States to --
2751,"Well , joining us now , the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , William Donaldson ."
2752,"MR. chairman , it 's good to have you here ."
2753,"Nice to be here , Lou ."
2754,"Let 's start with that surprise , the malfeasance that is crossing your desk ."
2755,Are you suggesting corporate America has not learned its lesson yet ?
2756,"Well , no ."
2757,I think that quote is a little out of context there .
2758,"there are 15,000 companies in the United States , and I think the great bulk of them are very honestly managed and so forth ."
2759,a number of people have had egregious fraud and so forth .
2760,There 's been a general loosening of morals across the board .
2761,"What I was referring to in that quote you had was the number of cases we see day in and day out at the lowest levels , scams and so forth , where considerable amounts of money are being made and lost by relatively small investors ."
2762,Is the investor today in your judgment secure ?
2763,"Well , I think that the marketplace is becoming increasingly secure ."
2764,"I think a number of the reforms that have come via the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and a number of things that we have done at the SEC are basically making everybody take a new look at how they 're performing their duty as a director , how they 're performing their duties on audit committees and compensation committees and in Wall Street ."
2765,I think the reforms that came as a part of the large settlement are going to change the way research and investment banking are done to the betterment of the individual investor .
2766,And some people are surprised and I might even add pleased in this city that your SEC has been quick to react when Phil Purcell of Morgan Stanley made a statement that your SEC did n't think and that you did n't think expressed appropriate contrition when Bear Stearns stepped out of line in the view of the SEC .
2767,"It was n't a polite phone call quietly made , either from your enforcement division or from your office , it was rather public ."
2768,Is that the way you 're going to operate ?
2769,"Well , Lou , we 're deadly serious about bringing reform into the marketplace ."
2770,"We 're deadly serious about some of the actions we 've taken , and when we see people who do n't appear to be taking it too seriously , we 're going to get to them right away ."
2771,And I think perhaps no one more surprised than some of the people running those firms on Wall Street .
2772,"You have also expressed concern about excessive executive compensation , particularly CEO compensation ."
2773,Is there really anything that can be done about this problem ?
2774,"I think so , Lou ."
2775,I think the real next step here is for compensation committees to spend a little more time than they do on what they 're really compensating for .
2776,I think there 's been too much emphasis on performance defined strictly by stock performance and earnings per share .
2777,"I think there are a number of other measures that indicate how well somebody 's doing running a company , and I think corporation boards need to spend more time on that dimension ."
2778,"And with you as Chairman of the SEC exercising your bully pulpit , one assumes that --"
2779,"As we said , earlier this week , Christine Todd Whitman stepped down and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why she stepped down , the job she 's done when she was in office and the job that has yet to be complete ."
2780,"From our New York bureau as I was introducing a moment ago , Dan Fagen , the environment writer for News Day ."
2781,"and Dan , Whitman did consider herself sort of the Republican environmentalist , but now there 's been an awful lot of Monday night quarterback quarterbacking taking place now that she 's stepped down ."
2782,What do you suppose took place here ?
2783,I think many people have watched this administration in action and watched Christy Whitman in action .
2784,The mystery is that she took the job in the first place or did n't leave earlier .
2785,"She was quite a misfit for this administration , and she showed that over and over ."
2786,"She was not good at all at communicating the administration 's message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even worse at bringing the EPA bureaucracy , the EPA environmental policy makers ' message to this administration because she saw herself undercut over and over ."
2787,"That 's interesting because leading into it , while she was New Jersey governor , she sued the EPA and she was very much considering herself to be an environmentalist , and then only to end up becoming the head of the EPA and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations ."
2788,Let 's hear what she had to say last Wednesday here on CNN just after announcing her resignation .
2789,"I 'm not leaving because of clashes with the administration , in fact , I have n't had any ."
2790,"I report to the President , and he has always asked me to give him my best unadulterated advice ."
2791,We have have been on the same page .
2792,I was never supportive of protocol because it did n't do what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned .
2793,I 'm leaving now because it 's the appropriate time to do it .
2794,"Dan , do you agree with that ?"
2795,She says the appropriate time .
2796,Do you suppose for personal reasons or perhaps she was out of step with the administration ?
2797,"I 'm sure that it was difficult for her personally , but I think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if everyday she did n't see herself being undermined and overruled ."
2798,"I mean if Christy Whitman and the White House were on the same page , I do n't think I 've seen a book large enough to contain a page that big ."
2799,"Over and over there were many , many instances over the last --"
2800,"Moving ahead now to a developing story , the hunt for so - called smoking gun , meant to prove that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction ."
2801,Here 's national security correspondent David Ensor .
2802,Reporter :
2803,"While U.S. forces still have n't found any weapons of mass destruction , the new CIA Pentagon report says officials are now confident the mysterious trucks filled with high - tech equipment found in Iraq are indeed mobile biological weapons production facilities , just as Secretary of State Powell predicted and presented the United Nations before the war ."
2804,It 's very important to recognize that programs that we had said existed do exist .
2805,Reporter :
2806,"Though no trace of biological toxin was found in the trucks , U.S. intelligence officials say they have largely eliminated any other possible use for the fermenters and other equipment ."
2807,Not everyone is convinced .
2808,"They could very well be biological weapons production facilities , but I do n't think the intelligence community has made an open and shut case ."
2809,Reporter :
2810,"The CIA - Pentagon reports admits the trucks were not an efficient way to produce biological weapons , but officials argue the point for the Iraqis was to produce some and not to be caught doing it ."
2811,"This was clearly a very inefficient way to produce anthrax , and the question is why did they invest such resources in a mobile --"
2812,"Moving on to the Laci Peterson case Bill , an unusual request from Scott Peterson 's attorney ."
2813,A pair of Laci Peterson 's missing shoes could be very important evidence in Scott 's murder trial .
2814,She is asking anyone who finds the pair to give them back .
2815,No sign of Geragos or Peterson in court yesterday when a judge was considering whether to unseal warrants obtained before Scott Peterson 's arrest .
2816,Peterson awaiting trial in the murder of his wife Laci and their unborn son .
2817,"Joining us , Beth Caras ."
2818,Good morning once again .
2819,Thanks for being with us .
2820,Now back to `` people in the news . ''
2821,Good to be -LRB- bleep -RRB- King .
2822,Reporter :
2823,"With the success of a new television show and last year 's Oz-fest tour ready to kick off , things were looking great for Ozzy Osbourne ."
2824,"He was sober , he was rich and surrounded by a family who loved him but once again , Ozzy 's high would hit a low ."
2825,"That July , Sharon Osbourne , Ozzy 's long - time manager , wife and best friend , announced to the world that she 'd been diagnosed with colon cancer ."
2826,Every fiber of Ozzy was shaken .
2827,He had to be sedated for a while .
2828,Reporter :
2829,Sharon would have to undergo rounds of chemotherapy all summer .
2830,Ozzy took time off from Oz-fest to tend to his wife .
2831,"Ever the rock , Sharon faced cancer head on ."
2832,"When you go in there and people so much worse than me , and it 's like , How lucky am I to have a great support system ."
2833,Reporter :
2834,"Even with Sharon trying to make things as easy as possible on her husband , he was still a mess ."
2835,His struggle with sobriety would be tested again .
2836,Ozzy 's not doing too good right now .
2837,Drinking ?
2838,Drinking and he 's very delicate .
2839,"He 's , like , dealing with it the best he can ."
2840,Reporter :
2841,"Despite Sharon 's illness , it 's business as usual for the family ."
2842,"Though pushed back , filming commenced last fall on a second season of `` the Osbournes . ''"
2843,"Some days when I 'm feeling bad , I say I ca n't do this anymore , and then you wake up and see the crew , and then , you know , you snap out of it ."
2844,Reporter :
2845,The larger question loomed .
2846,How could comedy come out of chemotherapy treatments ?
2847,Sharon is dealing with the diagnosis and illness but what 's interesting is humor is the same .
2848,Reporter :
2849,And the humor did remain the same .
2850,The show came back with a vengeance last fall chronicling Ozzy and Sharon dealing with cancer and the kids coping with new - found celebrity and one of the top rated shows .
2851,Ratings for the second season slid .
2852,"I 'm not banking my whole life on bringing , you know , number one rated show ."
2853,Having a nervous breakdown .

2858,His family said that his party life style caught up with him .
2859,"Now , with a third season set to start , will Ozzy 's role as a family man change the image in the annuls of heavy metal mad man ?"
2860,"I think Ozzy 's the guy that hit a head of a bat , you know ?"
2861,"Crazy , drug taking , hard drinking , hard living rock n roller ."
2862,"I think what the show does is also show that you might be those things , but also might be a pretty great dad , too ."
2863,I would n't be here now if it was n't for my wife .
2864,I always loved my wife but sometimes I do n't like her and sometimes she does n't like me but we love each other .
2865,"I hate these people that go , we 've been married for 56 years and never had a bad word ."
2866,They must have been living in a different planet .
2867,Reporter :
2868,Ozzy Osbourne 's life filled with incredible highs crashing into devastating lows .
2869,"A manic life , grounded in family values ."
2870,"Ozzy 's not going to like me saying this , but he 's a very tender , gentle man ."
2871,This is a guy whose world revolves not so much around music as around his wife .
2872,Rock `n roll !
2873,Part of the legacy of Ozzy Osbourne is a cautionary tale .
2874,"It 's also , you know , tale that includes family love , you know , and a lot of good things ."
2875,We have had it .
2876,Reporter :
2877,It 's a tale that continues to unfold .

2890,Canada is on the path to becoming the third country to allow gay marriage .
2891,The federal government will not appeal the court ruling that cleared the way for same - sex unions .
2892,Prime Minister Jean Chretien says the government will now draft legislation legalizing gay marriages .
2893,"And the U.S. government , can withhold the names of people detained as part of the 9 / 11 investigation ."
2894,That 's the decision from a federal appeals court reversing a lower court ruling .
2895,The Justice Department argued that releasing the names could hamper ongoing investigations .

2900,Convicted rapist and Max Factor heir Andrew Luster is back in California .
2901,Luster returned to Los Angeles yesterday from Mexico following his capture Tuesday by American bounty hunters .
2902,Luster skipped bail during his trial in January for raping and drugging three women .
2903,He was sentenced in abstentia to 124 years in prison .
2904,An occasion that marked the formal establishment between our two countries .
2905,Since then this relationship has grown in importance to us both through good times and bad .
2906,Both of my generation and Britain have special pause to remember the unacceptable sacrifice the Russian people made to defeat fascism in the Second World War .
2907,"Nothing , not even the fact that our countries became estranged in the war 's aftermath , has ever dimmed our memory of the scale of your loss ."
2908,"That experience should continue to inspire us , as we seek to build a more peaceful and secure world ."
2909,"When I visited your country in 1994 , I recall saying to President Yeltsin that he and I spent most of our lives believing such a visit would never happen , and that I hoped he was as delighted as I was to be proved wrong ."
2910,"I 'm just as delighted now , nine years later , to be able to welcome you here and to learn about the great changes which have occurred in your country since I was there ."
2911,Russia has established itself as our partner and our friend .
2912,"We work together bilatarily and on the international stage , and we are developing new links all the time in fields of commerce , culture , counterterrorism , energy , education environment ."
2913,I know you will be seeing evidence of some of this during your visit .
2914,"Mr. President , it is , I believe , a sign of genuine friendship that we are able to have disagreements , but remain firm partners ."
2915,"It is no secret that the significant differences between our two countries earlier this year on how best to handle Iraq , but we are now able to look forward together firmly in agreement on the route we have decided in the United Nations , although , the tragic loss of British lives today reminds us all of the difficulties to be faced ."
2916,"But as we look ahead , we know that our long - term partnership is of profound importance to both of us ."
2917,"This is clearly evident , if we look beyond the challenges of international politics ."
2918,"In the last few months alone , we have heard the announcements of major investments in Russia by British companies ."
2919,"We have also heard a different sign of Sir Paul McCartney playing to enthusiastic crowds in Red Square , and we , in turn , have been enthralled by the celebrations of your own city in Petersburg ."
2920,"At the same time , work continues to bring the young people of our countries closer together through language , teaching , school exchanges and university programs ."
2921,We have a vibrant and exciting relationship from which we both derive mass benefit .
2922,"Mr. President , your country is rich --"
2923,We have a major development to report tonight involving the crash of that Singapore Airlines 747 in Taiwan this week .
2924,Taiwanese officials thousand now say .
2925,"They confirm the pilot made a wrong turn , simply down the wrong runway ."
2926,Correspondent Ned Colt has our report .
2927,Tonight it appears at least 82 are dead from what may have been a wrong turn .
2928,Sources close to the investigation tell NBC News that Singapore Airlines flight 6 tried to take off on a runway closed for repairs .
2929,"She crash site today , the trail of evidence on the closed runway ."
2930,"Chunks of wreckage , fuselage , stretching in a straight line for hundreds of yards ."
2931,Twisted overturned construction equipment .
2932,This is what the 747 slammed into Tuesday night in a blinding rain storm .
2933,Today investigators say the pilot had confirmed with the control tower moments before taking off he had turned onto the correct runway but pilots behind him say he turned onto the wrong runway .
2934,"They say the plane took off , clicking the construction equipment , slamming into the ground and then breaking up ."
2935,As the plane was taking off this passenger noticed she did n't see any runway lights .
2936,I used to see the lights going by and I looked out and said it 's pitch black out here .
2937,"Reporter Lee , flying in from California , unsure if his wife was alive , today , identifying his remains , and tonight survivor John Diaz begins the long trip home to California ."
2938,"I just want to get home , never been so ready to get back to the United States ."
2939,"His flight number a reminder Singapore Airlines 006 , the same flight he survived Tuesday night ."
2940,"Gregg Jarrett , they did get a unanimous court for this decision ."
2941,"Absolutely , Brian ."
2942,"It was very stern , very direct and it left no question , I think , in the minds of anybody that this court unanimously believes that certification should include the manual recount , and that is a clear victory for Vice President Al Gore ."
2943,"The language here , really leaves no doubt ."
2944,"The right of the people to cast their vote , the court said , is paramount ."
2945,The amended certifications must be accepted by November 26 .
2946,"The reason they are picking that particular day is it allows , Brian , enough time for the aggrieved party , the losing party to file within 10 days a contest of the certification and that still allows enough time for the contest to be litigated through the courts primarily the circuit court and back to the Supreme Court if necessary and still meet the December 12 deadline for the Electoral College vote here ."
2947,"Now , Greg , the only question that means anything at this hour ."
2948,We know their view is the hand counts should now be included .
2949,Will it put Al Gore over the top in the race to match and exceed the votes of George W. Bush ?
2950,"It very well could , although , I must say that the Gore campaign has been somewhat disappointed by the number of votes they have not received thus far in the counties that are undertaking the manual recounts , Brian , but a lot of hand counts still must be tallied ."
2951,"We are also including the undervotes of 10,000 in Palm Beach and junt votes of 10,000 in Miami - Dade as well ."
2952,"Keep in mind , those were not registered by the computers because they either had a hanging chad or dimpled chad ."
2953,Those must be gone over by hand by each respective canvassing board .
2954,So there are a lot of votes remaining there .
2955,This is a Gore campaign to the White House .
2956,"Greg , just a logistic question , How long is it going take you to get the opinion run to you from the building behind you ?"
2957,I would say we should have it here in the next five minutes .
2958,It depends how quickly the line moves .
2959,"We have two producers , I believe , near the front of the line ."
2960,It how quickly they get handed .
2961,"It reversed the two orders of the earlier trial court , Circuit Court Judge Terry Lewis ."
2962,"The bottom line , this court rules unanimously the right of the people to have the votes counted is paramount , thus , the amended certifications to include the hand counts must be accepted by November 26 ."
2963,"In fact , it seemed to have some language here ."
2964,"In fact , Brian I do have it handed to me now ."
2965,Let me take a the .
2966,"Brian , if for some reason the Secretary of State would n't accept by the 26th , the certification , it could be certified elsewhere ."
2967,Gregg Jarrett .
2968,"I should point out , he is a former lawyer himself and so can help put this into English ."
2969,"Greg , go ahead , if you come to a passage we should hear ."
2970,I 'm flipping through the summary of enacts because that is not important .
2971,The summary of facts .
2972,You flag us when you come to the first portion we should hear aloud .
2973,"Recapping the developments of this disturbing day in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula -- at least six American sailors are dead , 11 still missing and 35 injured after what intelligence experts say was a well - planned terrorist bombing that ripped a 20 x 40 - foot hole in the Navy destroyer `` USS Cole '' in the Yemeni port of Aden ."
2974,The ship was there for refueling .
2975,"President Clinton , vowing retaliation ."
2976,"As we heard from David Gregory , one of Governor Bush 's main themes in these last days of the campaign is getting rid of partisan gridlock in Washington , which was exactly what the President was talking about today -- an attempt to reopen debate on a $ 240 billion tax cut plan , saying the version House Republicans passed is unacceptable , because it is unfair , according to the President , to children and seniors ."
2977,"Instead of meeting us on common ground , instead of working with the White House or congressional Democrats , the Republican leadership closed its doors to compromise -- literally closed the doors to compromise ."
2978,They crafted their own partisan tax package and passed it last night on a party - line vote .
2979,Republican leaders for their part said reopening the tax debate is not now realistic and the tax cut bill is probably tombed .
2980,They are angry that the President is threatening to veto it saying it 's wrong to have political budget battles right before the election .
2981,"NBC 's David Gregory is at his post as well in Austin , Texas ."
2982,David any reaction from the Bush team on the Democrats ' plan to contest the vote in Miami - Dade ?
2983,"Well , John , there has been reaction from the Bush team ."
2984,"You know , this decision by the Gore campaign , a refusal to concede even if they do not prevail in the manual recounts under way certainly carries some political risk , but the Gore team tonight defends the decision , saying that fellow Democrats and the public would not only accept but demand what they call a fair and accurate recount in all the relevant counties ."
2985,"The Bush team , responding quickly saying there would not be such support and that in that scenario Gore could only be seen as a sore loser ."
2986,"Despite the holiday , there is no letup in the fight for Florida ."
2987,"A holiday legal victory to be thankful for , George and Laura Bush , all smiles in Austin today before a pot luck Thanksgiving meal with their twin daughters and friends ."
2988,The Texas governor makes time for recreation with a morning jog and prepares for some fishing at his ranch this weekend .
2989,"The Vice President out of sight today at his residence , aides saying the entire family together for a meal and football on TV ."
2990,"While the Gore menu remains a family secret , the Bush clan all to happy to share some of his favorite fare -- jalapeno pecan cornbread stuffing and coconut cake ."
2991,"For vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney , turkey in the hospital with his wife and daughter this afternoon ."
2992,"After suffering a mild heart attack yesterday , his fourth , doctors say today he 's recovering well ."

2994,"I want everybody who tried to vote who legally voted to have their vote count , including service people ."
2995,Everybody .

3002,"And one of the longest running struggles for international justice reached a milestone today of sorts , when a Scottish court , meeting in the Netherlands , finally officially found someone guilty in the 1988 bombing that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 ."
3003,"He 's a Libyan intelligence agent and as NBC 's Jim Maceda reports tonight from the court , many of the families of the victims think the verdict did n't go far enough ."
3004,Today was D - Day in the murder trial which in the end brought some relief .
3005,"For grieving families , only a partial victory ."
3006,"After 12 years of waiting and a nine - month trial , family members of some of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 come to this special Scottish courthouse in the Netherlands one last time to hear the verdict against two Libyan defendants charged with murder ."
3007,"A split decision for Lamen Khalifa Fhimah , aquittal , but Abdel Basset Ali Al - megrahi found guilty as charged ."
3008,"The court ruled this senior Libyan intelligence agent planted the bomb that killed 270 , mostly Americans , when the plane bound for New York exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland ."
3009,"Inside the courtroom today , the elation overwhelming ."
3010,A good many of the relatives gasped .
3011,There was a big intake of breath .
3012,"Jim Swire , whose daughter died in the 1988 crash , collapses ."
3013,"He later recovered , blaming stress ."
3014,"But Al - megrahi 's sentence , 20 years in jail , too light for Brian Flynn ."
3015,His brother was on Flight 103 .
3016,It was n't one murder it was 270 people he murdered .
3017,"Frustration too that Moammar Khaddafi was immune from prosecution , one of the ground rules here ."
3018,You get the operatives .
3019,You do n't always get the higherups .
3020,"Reaction in Libya , where many followed the trial , mixed ."
3021,"Some anger in the streets , but government officials downplaying the conviction , calling for an end to international sanctions ."
3022,"Not yet , says President George W. Bush , at the White House today , demanding that Khaddafi meet certain conditions first , to accept responsibility for this act , and to compensate the families ."
3023,But even that would fall short for those who have lost loved ones .
3024,"Tonight , some of those families made it clear their battle is not over to get to the truth and however difficult , punish the real authors of this crime ."
3025,Tom ?
3026,"Thanks very much , NBC 's Jim Maceda tonight for the trial of the Lockerbie 103 Pan Am crash ."
3027,"And not far from Lebanon , a source at the Syrian interior ministry said that the military commander of the Tawhid Wal Jihad Organization in Syria blew himself up after being chased by the security forces at the Jdeidet Yabus border crossing ."
3028,"The source said that the man , called Omar Abdullah , also known as Omar Hamra , was carrying nine , uh , forged identity documents ."
3029,"The statement of the Syrian interior ministry said that Omar Abdullah , 28 years old , was first to open fire with a pistol in his possession , on security men who were suspicious of his identity ."
3030,"The young man , who leads the armed wing of the Tawhid Wal Jihad Organization , tried to escape but the security forces surrounded him , and he had no alternative , either to surrender or to commit suicide , so he chose the latter by detonating an explosive belt he had tied around his waist ."
3031,"In addition to the terrorist , as the authorities call him , two Syrian security men were injured ."
3032,"These incidents took place on the Syrian side of the border with Lebanon at the Jdeidet Yabus crossing point , at a distance of a few kilometers from the Masnaa post on the other side of the border ."
3033,"The official version says that Omar Abdullah , also known as Omar Hamra , was carrying nine different , forged identity documents ."
3034,It is not known whether he succeeded in moving around using them in the past or if this was the first time he tried this dangerous journey .
3035,"The man was wanted by the Syrian Security Services because of his connection with an organization they describe as extremist , in reference to the Tawhid Wal Jihad which the authorities consider a twin of the Jund Al - Shaab Organization ."
3036,"This organization , which was founded in Afghanistan by Islamists from Syria , Palestine and Jordan , is blamed for a number of incidents that have taken place in the country in the past two years ."
3037,"An attempt to attack the American Embassy last September was foiled by the Security Services and led to the death of five people , including four of the attackers ."
3038,"The Security Services also carried out what they call preemptive attacks in each of the following : Daff Al - Shawk in the capital , in Aleppo , and Khasham in the Al - Hasakah Governorate , in the north of the country ."
3039,"They also clashed extensively with gunmen in Hama , the city that is famous for the killing of thousands of its people in 1982 , when the authorities were engaged in quelling the Islamist movement there ."
3040,Philippine President Gloria Arroyo has declared that the Philippines is a disaster - stricken country because of the hurricane which hit the country last Thursday .
3041,"At the same time , devastated villages began to bury their victims as officials attempted to obtain food and water supplies ."
3042,"Rescue teams continued search operations for more bodies under the volcanic rubble , rocks and mud amidst predictions that the death toll would rise to around 700 ."
3043,"This is how the villages looked , buried by the mud , flood and rain waters which accompanied the destructive hurricane that swept across broad expanses of the eastern Philippines ."
3044,"At the same time , the country began a relief operation to reach the victims of the natural disaster which left behind around 700 dead and thousands of homeless , injured and missing people ."
3045,The country 's president Gloria Arroyo Macapagal declared the Philippines a disaster - stricken country entitled to aid .
3046,She called on the countries of the world and on international relief organizations to quickly send convoys of humanitarian aid which include medical and food aid and the necessary equipment to extricate bodies buried by mud under the rubble of their homes in poor villages .
3047,"This comes as the disaster - stricken villages , as a result of the mudslides in the east Philippines , began to bury their dead in a painful picture which reminded the world of the tsunami that struck the coasts of Asia at the beginning of last year ."
3048,"Rescue teams continued their search operations for more bodies under the volcanic debris , rocks and mud at the foot of Mayon volcano in the Albay province at a distance of 330 kilometers south of the capital Manila ."
3049,"For its part , the National Disaster Coordinating Council confirmed that at least 285 people had been killed in the province of Albay , the majority of their deaths caused by mudslides resulting from Hurricane Durian ."
3050,"At the same time , at least 292 people are still amongst the missing and it is feared that they may have died as well ."
3051,"The council said that Hurricane Durian which hit the east Philippines coast last Thursday with a maximum wind speed of 195 kilometers per hour caused the deaths of 18 other people in the provinces of Camarine Sur , Catanduanes , Quezon and Oriental Mindoro ."
3052,A local Red Cross official in Albay said that statistics suggested that the number of missing people could reach 779 people .
3053,Experts said that the torrential rain which accompanied Hurricane Durian stirred up volcanic ash sediments on the upper slopes of Mount Mayon causing severe mudslides which buried the surrounding areas .
3054,Hurricane Durian is still leaving more victims and destruction in its path .
3055,The hurricane caused the deaths of around 1200 people in the Philippines and dozens in Vietnam while authorities in the disaster - stricken areas fear an exacerbation of the situation and an increase in the number of victims of the sweeping hurricane .
3056,"From here Hurricane Durian swept over southern Vietnam , leaving no less than 37 people dead after killing over 1200 people in the Philippines ."
3057,The hurricane was accompanied by winds at a speed of 120 kilometers an hour which pushed the Vietnamese authorities to evacuate 3500 people from different areas .
3058,The authorities fear the toll will be worse in this flat region exposed to the winds .
3059,"On the island of Fukio , winds destroyed hundreds of boats moored off the shore , tore the roofs off houses and pulled up electricity poles as well as cutting off some roads ."
3060,8000 people were evacuated from Ho Chi Minh City .
3061,"In spite of the deaths left in the wake of the hurricane , material losses and the loss of roofs from houses , life quickly returned to the streets of Vietnam where some shops opened and the roads teemed with bicycles , the well - known means of transportation there ."
3062,Tropical Hurricane Durian cut off electricity at the beginning and sank over 800 boats along the southern coast of Vietnam until the storm changed course suddenly to head for south - west Vietnam .
3063,The National Search and Rescue Committee said that telephone and electricity lines had been cut off and roads closed because of falling trees in the village of Fong Tao to the east of Ho Chi Minh City .
3064,"The number of people affected by the storm in three provinces was at least 50,000 ."
3065,"So in just a few seconds , Hurricane Durian transformed more than one province into ruins and carried away dear ones , leaving behind lakes of water , mud , destruction and sorrow ."
3066,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed its support for the principle of fair geographic representation in the United Nations Security Council , in both its permanent and non-permanent memberships ."
3067,"It expressed the view that the purpose of developing the Security Council structure should be to strengthen the capabilities of the council to perform its role in an effective way , to achieve the desired objective of the international community in maintaining international peace and security ."
3068,"This came in the Kingdom 's speech before the General Assembly , in the sixty - first session on articles ten and one hundred and eleven , regarding the Security Council 's decision on the issue of fair representation in the Security Council , increasing the number of its members and the related issues , which His Royal Highness Prince Mishal Bin Abdallah Bin Abd - al - Aziz , Minister Plenipotentiary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , gave yesterday before the council ."
3069,His Highness said that the Kingdom confirms the extreme importance it places on the Security Council 's performance of its role and the full responsibility assigned to it to preserve security and peace in an effective way in all regions of the world .
3070,"His Highness said that the Kingdom at the same time expresses its disappointment at the effect of the resolutions and work procedures of the council and its double standard policy , which has prevailed in some of its works , especially those related to some security and peace cases in the Middle East region ."
3071,"His Highness added that the whole world watched the Israeli assaults on Lebanon and on Palestinian lands in a full - scale war aimed at the deliberate destruction of the infrastructure , and violations of human and national rights that targeted innocent civilians with assassination , detention and torture without any consideration for international agreements and treaties or humanitarian considerations ."
3072,"As many as 10,000 residential households and work units have been left without heating since the early hours of December 3 over a total area of four million square meters in the Shuimogou and Tianshan districts of Urumqi , Xinjiang , because there was a breakdown in the equipment of the electricity company responsible for the task of providing heat ."
3073,"According to monitoring readings taken by the local meteorological department , over the last two days , the lowest temperature at night in Urumqi has been about 14 degrees Celsius below zero ."

3085,"On the morning of the 24th , local time , Chinese State President Hu Jintao held talks here with Pakistani President Musharraf ."
3086,Both sides heaped praise on the all - weather friendship and comprehensive cooperation between China and Pakistan and stated in concert that they would jointly strive to continuously enrich and flesh out the content of the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries as well as deepen and expand pragmatic and mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields .
3087,"Hu Jintao said China and Pakistan were good neighbors , good friends , good partners and good brothers ."
3088,"In the fifty - five years since diplomatic relations were established , Sino - Pakistani relations have withstood the test of time and a changing international situation , erected an all - weather friendship and developed a comprehensive cooperation ."
3089,"The fruits of the exchange and cooperation between the two sides in politics , economics and trade , military affairs , technology , culture , education and other spheres have been remarkable ."
3090,In international and regional affairs they have coordinated closely and supported each other .
3091,"China is grateful to Pakistan for the long - term and treasured support it has given China on Taiwan , Tibet , human rights , combating terrorist powers and other issues ."
3092,"China will support Pakistan as always as it strives to safeguard its independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity ."
3093,"According to a BBC report on the nineteenth , a study group composed of American and Russian scientists recently discovered several kinds of microbes composed of special substances ."
3094,"Following their research , the scientists made a bold supposition : that some of the earliest simple life forms on Earth were very likely attached to meteorites from Mars that came to Earth ."
3095,"In their research , the American and Russian scientists discovered that these special microbes can live even after being exposed to radiation thousands of times greater than the radiation the human body can withstand ."
3096,"Because of this , they think that these special and rare microbes have already gained some kind of ability to resist powerful radiation while maintaining moisture ."
3097,The scientists do not believe that any life forms originated on Earth would be able to develop these special capabilities .
3098,"Because there is evidence indicating that there have not been large fluctuations in radiation levels on Earth during the past four billion years , they think that these super-microbes could have originated from Mars and come to Earth as they hitched a ride on meteorites , and ultimately become the earliest simple life forms on Earth ."
3099,The results of their research will be published in the latest edition of the journal Astrobiology .
3100,"However , many other scientists have nevertheless expressed doubts on this ."
3101,Some scholars have pointed out that the DNA of these super-microbes does not differ in many ways from regular microbes .
3102,"Other scientists have also pointed out that of the tens of thousands of meteorites already found on Earth , only twenty or so came from Mars ."
3103,"Even if these super-microbes had existed on Mars , the possibility that they hitched a ride to Earth on meteorites is not very great either ."
3104,"In view of the important characteristics of warfare in a modern information rich environment , a training base in the Lanzhou Military Command has taken care to create a complex electromagnetic environment when organizing army exercises , in order to improve through training the military 's ability to win battles in an information - rich environment ."
3105,"During one recently organized exercise , to create the electromagnetic environment for the blue force 's command and communication system , they used the method which combines real and simulated set - up , aerial and land - based , fixed and tracking , and real and fake measures ."
3106,"Using advanced electronic information technology and simulation technology , they produced things like mimic radar communication vehicles and mimic satellites communication vehicles that simulate electromagnetic properties ."
3107,They placed actual objects inside the blue force 's positions to mimic the electromagnetic environment that various kinds of weaponry would create during a battle .
3108,"Through the combined operation of many techniques , they chiefly worked to create a relatively complex electromagnetic battlefield for the army ."
3109,"Against a complex electromagnetic environment and countermeasures , they guided the army to carry out exercises in electronic reconnaissance and anti-reconnaissance , jamming and anti-jamming , suppression and anti-suppression actions and other operations ."
3110,This effectively trained and improved the army 's ability to carry out multiple combat operations in an information - rich environment .

3121,"Community leaders of Iraqi Shiite , Sunni , and Kurds have also held a joint press conference to appeal to the public to remain calm ."
3122,"Yes , well , yesterday the Chinese Foreign Ministry , uh , at this routine press conference , especially answered reporters with regard to this kind of questions ."
3123,"Well , the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not disclose specific content of the trilateral and bilateral meetings , uh , among China , the US , and North Korea held yesterday ."
3124,"However , the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the top priority for the current six - party talks is to put the various parties back on a track of dialogue and negotiation ."
3125,And at present the Chinese side also hopes very much that the various parties can make use of this rare opportunity for contact to %pw express everyone 's ideas and concerns .
3126,"Well , at the same time , uh , with everyone valuing this opportunity for contact as well , they can work together to promote these six - party talks , to resume the talks as early as possible and to achieve substantive progress ."
3127,"Yet as for the specific time that the talks will resume , which is the %pw , common concern of everyone , Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu did not give a clear answer ."

3135,"Sidney Yates was first elected to the U.S. house in 1948 , when Harry Truman was President and for more than 4 decades he trounced every challenger to face him in congressional election ."
3136,"He sat out 1 term after losing a U.S Senate race in the 1960s , but for 24 terms , Yates represented Chicago 's northern lake front and northern suburbs ."
3137,The congressman was known as a fervent liberal and supporter of the arts and he was noted for his success in getting congress to finance for national endowment for the art .
3138,"In 1993 , Yates was awarded a Presidential Citizen 's Medal for his efforts ."

3142,"In what may have been a ripple effect of the Middle East crisis , an explosion today killed at least four sailors on a US Navy destroyer in the Yemeni port of Aden ."
3143,"American investigators are going to the scene but in Washington at the White House , the Pentagon and the State Department , US officials are already expressing suspicions that today 's explosion was an act of terrorism ."
3144,The World 's Clark Boyd reports .
3145,"The blast , which occurred just after noon local time in Yemen , ripped a 20 x 40 foot gash in the USS Cole , a state - of - the - art destroyer that had stopped in Aden to refuel before joining the carrier George Washington in the Persian Gulf ."
3146,"Speaking at the Cole 's home base in Norfolk , Virginia , Admiral John Foley said that the Navy is investigating the incident ."
3147,I do n't know whether it was terrorism or not .
3148,"It was an act of certainly a severe belligerence but we do n't know the source , nor can I comment any further on that ."
3149,"But in Washington , Pentagon officials went further saying that they had every reason to suspect that the blast was caused by terrorists ."
3150,"The officials said that reports from the scene , including one from an Army officer working in Aden Harbor , suggested that a small rubber craft that was helping the Cole dock came alongside the destroyer and caused the blast ."
3151,"Many , including retired Admiral Eugene Carroll , are suspicious that the small boat may have been loaded with high - power explosives and that the attack was planned ."
3152,"That craft that approached the Cole is a rubber boat , not a big craft , but they would have had to pack it fully with explosives to do the amount of damage that they did to the Cole and that certainly would have taken time to get that put together ."
3153,"While both the Pentagon and the Justice Department today dispatched teams of experts to Yemen to investigate the explosion , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged caution saying it was too early to jump to any conclusions ."
3154,"Still , she promised that the United States would take appropriate action if terrorists were found to be behind the blast , a sentiment echoed later in the day by President Clinton ."
3155,"If , as it now appears , this was an act of terrorism , it was a despicable and cowardly act ."
3156,We will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable .
3157,"If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East , they will fail utterly ."
3158,"For some terrorism experts today 's attack , which occurred against the backdrop of intense clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in the Middle East , has an eerily familiar ring to it ."
3159,Bruce Hoffman is the director of the Rand Corporation 's Washington office .
3160,We have seen often in the past how violence and conflict and tensions in the Middle East often embroil the United States .
3161,"One only has to recall the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 , also a month before presidential election , also at a time when Israel was involving suitable ferment at that point in Lebanon now with the Palestinians , where the United States was also attempting actively to provide some stabilizing influence and unfortunately and tragically got caught up in the maelstrom and that seems to be the salient fact of this attack ."
3162,"And if this attack turns out to be the work of terrorists , Hoffman says it would signal a dangerous new trend ."
3163,Maritime or marine - borne terrorist attacks are actually quite rare .
3164,That being said it could well be the beginning of a new pattern .
3165,"We have made it far more difficult , appropriately so , for terrorists to attack our ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula ."
3166,"So , I think terrorists prevented from attacking their targets using their more conventional means ` truck bombs ' have merely adjusted their tactics slightly and obviously they have been successful with it today ."
3167,"On Yemeni TV today the country 's President expressed his heart - felt condolences to those who were killed and injured , but denied that the explosion on board the cole was caused by terrorists , although , admits Mohammed Al - Qadhi , editor of the Yemen Observer newspaper in the capital Sana , anti-American sentiment has been running high in Yemen because of events in the Middle East ."
3168,"The people now in the streets are gathering because they feel that not just as Arabs , as human beings , that what is happening in Palestine is not humanitarian ."
3169,"Regarding the United States ' attitude in this regard , we find that the United States until now are supporting Israel ."
3170,The people here feel that United States should do something .
3171,"With tensions running high throughout the Middle East , today 's incident off the coast of Yemen serves as a warning ."
3172,US armed forces and diplomatic personnel might be on high alert for sometime to come .
3173,For The World this is Clark Boyd .
3174,"In the other major story out of the Middle East , Arab Foreign Ministers met today in Cairo in advance of Saturday 's Arab 's summit ."
3175,"Egypt called the emergency summit to declare support for the Palestinians in the wake of three weeks of violence that has left at least 106 people dead , almost all of them Palestinian ."
3176,"Violence has abated somewhat since the deal was struck at Sharm el - Sheikh two days ago , but Arab governments are under pressure from their own citizens to take a tough stance against Israel ."
3177,"James Drummond , covering the Arab summit in Cairo for the Financial Times ."
3178,"James , there 's a reason why the Arabs wanted this pre-summit meeting ."
3179,What is the pressure on them prior to the summit ?
3180,"Well , I think they want to try and iron out any potential difficulties before the heads of state come into town on Saturday and Sunday ."
3181,So this is a preparatory exercise to reach some sort of agreement beforehand .
3182,"Of course , the problem is that not all Arab states are speaking again with one voice ."
3183,What do they hope to achieve ? and what can you claim from the statements made today ?
3184,"It is difficult to say , Arab 's summit have traditionally been exercises in division ."
3185,"We have already seen problems from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Tuesday who appeared on Al - Jazeera , the pan-Arab satellite channel , and , rubbish , what he said was a draft statement for the end of the summit on Sunday ."
3186,And he was very categorical that it was too weak and did not harm Israeli interests sufficiently .
3187,So we have Gadafi on the one hand .
3188,"On the other hand we have Egypt which was the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish state , which is of course also a top recipient of US aid ."
3189,The Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is more of a voice of moderation against the other side .
3190,Tell us about what he has been saying .
3191,"Well , Mr. Mubarak has been , as you say , a voice of moderation ."
3192,"He has invested an awful amount in the peace with Israel , and really he can not afford to let it fail ."
3193,"We have seen some more power techniques perhaps from his Foreign Minister Amre Moussa over the last few weeks , but Amre Moussa today at the Foreign Minister 's meeting was calling simply for the return of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians , in stark contrast to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al - Shara who was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations between Israel and the two Arab states that happen ."
3194,So Egypt is playing a calming role .
3195,It will not want to see anything too strong coming out of this summit due to end on Sunday .
3196,What seemed to be the prevailing voices at this point ?
3197,There are certainly calls for war against Israel .
3198,Is there much support for that ?
3199,"Well , actually President Mubarak was very categorical today in condemning calls for war , which he said were very serious and people should understand the implications of just what it meant ."
3200,Egypt and Jordan do not want to see any sort of conventional war against Israel .
3201,"They have both invested enormous amounts in it , and both regimes would be more vulnerable if the peace process were to fail , because detractors and opponents within each country would have ammunition by which to fire at them ."
3202,How much is the United States entering into the conversation and how much pressure seems to be coming from the United States ?
3203,Well today not too much .
3204,I mean Madeleine Albright was in Saudi Arabia yesterday where she met with crown prince Abdullah and the new Syrian President Bashar Al - Assad .
3205,Interestingly enough she is quoted as telling General Sanholi back to the US that she did not really get too much of a reception from Bashar Al - Assad in terms of lightening the traditionally antagonistic Syrian align towards Israel .
3206,"Nonetheless , the fact that she did meet with Bashar Al - Assad and it was n't Saudi Arabia which is traditionally being more dovish and has supported US policy , it is significant ."
3207,"So , as of today , I would say certainly on the surface there has been little US action ."
3208,"Well , thank you very much for the update ."
3209,"James Drummond , correspondent for the Financial Times of London speaking to us from Cairo ."
3210,Thank you James .
3211,Thanks .
3212,"With this month 's ouster of strongman Slobodan Milosevic , Yugoslavia is rapidly joining the international community ."
3213,"Today , the country was admitted into an international Balkan development program ."
3214,"Belgrade now hopes to join the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank ."
3215,"At home , President Vojislav Kostunica says that he intends to promote democracy and free speech , but Kostunica just might have second thoughts , once a theater group that roasted his predecessor over the coals starts turning him on a spit ."
3216,The World 's Nened Chebeck reports from the Yugoslav capital .
3217,"These days at almost every street corner in central Belgrade , there is a stall selling compact discs with protest songs against the former regime , and the most popular tune blaring out of the speakers goes like this , `` attention , attention , last train for Serbia via day stop Kosovo and The Hague is departing with a ten hour delay ."
3218,It 's the latest hit by the satirical theater called `` Index '' .
3219,They started off 20 years ago in a local radio station and became an enormous success on stage and not just here in Serbia .
3220,"They toured the world and performed wherever there is an emigrant community from the former Yugoslavia scattered by the wars here , from Australia to New York where Index will be returning in late November ."
3221,"This song is from their latest play , The Last Train for Serbia , which was recorded on the day protestors stormed the federal parliament in Belgrade and the main television stations ."
3222,The song speaks of panic in the household of Slobodan Milosevic .
3223,"Even before the former President conceded defeat , the Index Theater performed live on an improvised stage outside the parliament , in front of a crowd of some 300,000 people ."
3224,Actor Drugewbo Unitich tells how the show began .
3225,The first thing that I told them was please let us close our eyes and just listen .
3226,"When they did that and I saw them and I told them in a voice of Milosevic , `` Ladies and gentleman , I am definitely finished . ''"
3227,Only 3 or 4 hours after that he appeared on television and said something very similar to that .
3228,Yubitrich is one of Belgrade 's most popular actors and he owes it to his skilful portrayal of Slobodan Milosevic .
3229,"Getting into Milosevic 's shoes even on stage , was quite a temptation says Yubitrich ."
3230,"I always felt when I enter his person , Okay , that I can do whatever I want and I always molested our fellow players you know ."
3231,So being Milosevic is something which I can compare to taking a dangerous drug .
3232,"But with Milosevic out of the way , what next for Serbia 's most popular satirical group ?"
3233,Writer Vojislav Jonetic says he is confident the new Yugoslav government will provide plenty of fresh material .
3234,"We will have plenty of politicians , which we can play ."
3235,We will have plenty of idiotic situations in Serbian politics .
3236,"Political satirical theater is something which you can apply best to the societies , which are in some kind of crisis ."
3237,"We are still in crisis and we will be I think for a while , but the current crisis Jonetic hopes will at least be one where government critics will not be branded as traitors and be banned from public performances ."
3238,"Index Theater is planning a huge comeback now with a series of shows in Belgrade , but even though Milosevic is under de facto house arrest in Belgrade , he is very much present on the repertoire of political humors , says his impersonator , Dragewbo Yubitrich ."
3239,I would like to share one joke with the listeners of The World .
3240,It 's the year of 2004 .
3241,"In Serbia it is 57th round of elections from September 2000 and Slobodan Milosevic appears on national tv and says , `` I want to greet you as your new President , my name is Vojislav Kostunica '' ."
3242,"Yubitrich says , he has already set his sights on the new Yugoslav President , Kostunica and will most likely be impersonating him in the future ."
3243,"He is not as easy to make fun of yet Yubitritch says , unlike Milosevic , but that does n't mean he will escape the scrutiny and sharp wits of Index Theater ."
3244,"For The World , this is Nenad Chebeck in Belgrade ."
3245,"This is The World , I am Lisa Mullins ."
3246,Up next a global hip - hop beat laid down in New York and danced to in the West African nation of Senegal .
3247,The World 's Marco Warman has today 's musical finale .
3248,"Imagine trying to translate the lyrics of the Sugar Hill Gang 's notorious rap classic , Rapper 's Delight ."
3249,"Fortunately for rap fans in the Senegalese capital , Dakar translating these tunes is n't necessary ."
3250,The city has its own homegrown hip - hop scene .
3251,"It is a hip - hop but African hip - hop with African instruments , you know , African chant , traditional sounds ."
3252,"That is Amidu Barry , one half of the duo Positive Black Soul or PBS ."
3253,"They are the doyens of Dakar 's hip - hop scene , the Sugar Hill Gang of Senegal if you will ."
3254,"Positive Black Soul sings in Senegal 's main language Wolof but if the music sounds like it comes straight out of the Bronx , well , you are not far off ."
3255,PBS produce their albums in New York .
3256,Lead singer Amidu Berry says New York producers make hip - hop in any language come out sounding right .
3257,They know how to make a hip - hop record sound good .
3258,"They know the sound of hip - hop , you know , and they have got the equipment and the engineers and they know how to handle it ."
3259,But Positive Black Soul 's music is first and foremost Senegalese music .
3260,"When American saxophonist David Murray recorded his acclaimed afrocentric jazz album , Fo Juke Review in Dakar , he recruited Amidu Berry and DJ Awadi from PBS to show what an edge West African music can really have ."
3261,"When Awadi and Barry performed , they managed simultaneously to bathe in the group of American hip - hop and they keep a clear sense that they are from Senegal ."
3262,This connection to national and musical identities results partly from the fact that many Senegalese artists want to stay in Senegal to live and work says PBS singer Tidia Awadi .
3263,It is because they know they have the inspiration in their country .
3264,"I think everybody want to stay in his country , want to die in his country ."
3265,"If you can stay and make it happen , the place where you was born , where you grew up then try to make it there ."
3266,It 's possible .
3267,Senegalese rappers are also identified by what they say in their tracks .
3268,Western hip - hop lyrics often revolve around the accumulation of material wealth and throwing parties .
3269,PBS and other Senegalese rap groups have different concerns .
3270,"In the grim lyrics to Leboho Inwa , the executioner is black ."
3271,PBS raps that Africans are their worst enemies .
3272,Front man Amidu Barry may look like he got his moves on the streets of Brooklyn but his critique of post-colonial finger pointing in Africa tells a different story .
3273,"You know , in Africa every time you know something bad happens , everybody like you know is because of the white man , you know the colonization , the slavery ."
3274,They do n't realize that you know the real execution is really black 's black like them .
3275,"So before they say it is a white man tangle you know it 's because of a white man that this happens and they got to , you know , check around and they say who is the real guilty ."
3276,"We got to accept it and try to , you know , change the things , make the things better ."
3277,"Positive Black Soul are now the oldsters of Dakar 's hip - hop scene and they have established the template of social consciousness that many Senegalese hip - hop groups follow like Bootin Bye , which recently scored this hit about AIDS prevention ."
3278,Again Amidu Barry from Postive Black Soul .
3279,"When we started there were maybe two or three hip - hop groups in Dakar and now today we got more than 2000 groups only in Dakar , let 's say in Senegal ."
3280,Two thousand hip - hop bands ?
3281,"Hip - hop bands only in Dakar , not the whole Senegal ."
3282,So you know it is amazing .
3283,"It 's fantastic , extraordinary ."
3284,Just how extraordinary can be heard on a recent French recording .
3285,The Hop is a compilation featuring Dakar 's biggest rap stars from Bidu Bubes to the current kings of Senegalese hip - hop Daura G .
3286,That kind of success needs no translation .
3287,"For The World , I am Mark Warmen ."
3288,Clashes continued today in the West Bank and Gaza .
3289,Palestinian gunmen fired on an Israeli car killing the driver .
3290,Earlier today Israeli soldiers guarding a Jewish settlement shot and killed a Palestinian man who was later identified as an intelligence officer .
3291,The Israeli Army said the man had been approaching the guard post in a suspicious manner .
3292,"In Haiti , Jean - Bertrand Aristide has been declared the winner in last Sunday 's controversial presidential election ."
3293,NPR 's Jerry Hadden reports .
3294,Former President Aristide won with 92 percent of the vote according to Haitian election officials .
3295,The sweeping victory was expected since Aristide ran virtually unopposed .
3296,Opposition candidates boycotted the vote citing tainted legislative elections last May .
3297,Aristide was elected President for the first time ten years ago and served just months before a military coup sent him into exile in the United States .
3298,He now faces huge obstacles as Haiti 's leader .
3299,His country is the poorest in the hemisphere and much of the world community has shunned him .
3300,On Wednesday UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on his organization to close its mission in Haiti citing the unstable political climate .
3301,"Though a spate of pre-election violence kept some Haitians away from the polls on Sunday , the voting itself went relatively smoothly ."
3302,"Jerry Hadden , NPR News ."
3303,This is The World .
3304,I am Tony Kahn .
3305,"Gao Xingjian arrived in Stockholm this week and when he leaves the Chinese born writer will have something extra in his suitcase , the Nobel Prize for Literature ."
3306,"Today Gao , who now lives in France , gave the traditional Nobel lecture as part of the festivities leading up to Sunday 's ceremony , and on the same day he collects the prize ."
3307,Gao 's 1989 novel ` Soul Mountain ' will be published for the first time in America .
3308,"If you want to know what Gao Xingjian is all about , as a thinker and as an artist , our international book critic Christopher Meryl says Gao 's masterpiece is an ideal starting point ."
3309,His politics are embedded in his writing and his writing is first and foremost a celebration of freedom .
3310,"This novel ` soul mountain ' , which is just being released in the United States this week is in every possible way a celebration of what freedom means ."
3311,"It 's a large novel , full of all kinds of ideas and incidents and stories and tales and a polyphony of voices ."
3312,"It is , if you like , the whole world wrapped up in 500 pages ."
3313,"It is the world at its most carnival - like , and yet it is virtually impossible , is n't it , for a Chinese artist to do something or to make a statement without its having some kind of either political effect or be political in origin ."
3314,"I mean this man took the trip on which the novel was based for political reasons , did he not ?"
3315,Certainly .
3316,He is born in 1940 .
3317,He is a product of the Cultural Revolution .
3318,"In fact he had to burn up an entire suitcase full of hundreds of poems and plays and stories at the start of the Cultural Revolution in fear of going to prison , and then in 1983 after being diagnosed with lung cancer , which had killed his father three years earlier and being convinced that he himself was going to die , he gets a kind of reprieve ."
3319,"He gets a second chest X-ray , discovers that he does n't have lung cancer , recognizes that by virtue of the kinds of things that he is writing , his openness to Western literary ideas , that he is in political trouble again , and so he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey of some 15,000 kilometers , mostly on foot , which he takes through southwestern China ."
3320,"He had survived , if you will , a death sentence , and now in that new freedom of the life in front of him , he takes to the road in the tradition of old Chinese poets and records what he sees , what he hears , the stories that he is told ."
3321,"The book is filled with marvelous descriptions of the gorges through which he walks , the mountains that he climbs , indeed the book is called Soul Mountain , the mountain on which he hopes in some way or another to get in touch with his soul , his individual soul , as opposed to that mass kind of soul being enforced upon him by the Communist Chinese authorities , the social realism that the cadres would have him write in ."
3322,"Not only can this fellow write , he can paint too , ca n't he ?"
3323,He is best known among his neighbors in Paris as a painter .
3324,He has had more than 30 one - man shows and his paintings are quite delicately done and there he is also very well known as a playwright .
3325,I think he has published about 18 plays now and he writes his plays in French .
3326,"Just one last thing quoting him and I wonder if you could respond to this , Christopher , he said at the very beginning of his wonderful speech to the Nobel Prize Committee , he said , `` I do not wish to waste this talk on literature by saying too much about politics and history , What I want to do is to use this opportunity to speak as one writer in the voice of an individual . ''"
3327,"Is that true basically not only for him that day , today , but of all of his work ?"
3328,"Well , the work that we have so far in English translation suggests that , and indeed this novel , which is a celebration as well of the self of the individual , goes so far as to even divide up to the self ."
3329,"Characters proliferate out of the imagination of the narrator so that at a certain point , you have a new he , you have a new she , you have a you , and each one of these characters tells stories , each story of which is designed to give you a deeper sense of the richness and the complexity of life in China ."
3330,Christopher Meryl is Director of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa and our international book citric .
3331,"Thanks , Christopher ."
3332,Thank you .
3333,China released a government policy paper today about population and development .
3334,The paper said Beijing hopes to cap its population at 1.6 billion by the year 2050 .
3335,NPR 's Rob Gifford reports from the Chinese capital .
3336,The Chinese government today credited the one child policy with dramatically improving the quality of life for citizens of the world 's most populous nation .
3337,"China 's population currently stands at 1.26 billion , still the largest in the world , but the paper says that if it were n't for the one child policy that figure would be 300 million higher ."
3338,The white paper says the economy still faces a daunting challenge coping with the net annual increase of 10 million people over the next decade .
3339,"At the same time , it says , China will grapple with problems associated with a rapidly aging population and lack of an extensive social security system ."
3340,"Rob Gifford , NPR News , Beijing ."
3341,President Clinton has pardoned a former leading member of the House of Representatives convicted of corruption charges in 1996 .

3347,Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has given a defiant speech to mark the tenth anniversary of the Gulf War .
3348,He says Iraq has triumphed over the evil of the West .
3349,Barbara Plett reports from Baghdad .
3350,Saddam Hussein addressed the nation in a speech filled with rhetoric and a declaration of victory .
3351,"`` Iraq has triumphed over its enemies , '' he said , `` and it will triumph in the remaining rounds of the battle . ''"
3352,The Iraqi leader said the Gulf War was a confrontation between good and evil that continues to this day .
3353,"He was referring to his struggle against the US , which strongly supports the economic embargo meant to force him to disarm ."
3354,After the speech demonstrators gathered in a public show of support for their President .
3355,A sense of nationalism has grown stronger here as many people rally against what they say is a siege on their country .
3356,"Barbara Plett , BBC News , Baghdad ."
3357,Welcome to another hour of news and information here on the Voice of America .
3358,I 'm Victor Moralis along with David Chadwick on VOA News Now .
3359,"India has signed a series of deals with Russia to acquire an aircraft carrier , fighter jets and tanks ."
3360,The deals were signed as Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded his talks with Indian leaders in New Delhi .
3361,"The two countries also signed a strategic partnership agreement , obligating both countries to avoid joining political or military alliances against each other ."
3362,They also agreed to form a joint working group for mutual concerns on terrorism .
3363,News Now 's Susan Yakie spoke with our New Delhi correspondent Jim Teeple about the Russian leader 's visit and his comments about the situation in the disputed Kashmir region .
3364,"He said exactly what the Indians wanted to hear , which is that the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan should be solved bilaterally and that there should be no outside interference , as he put it in this question ."
3365,Now this is something the Indians have been saying all along .
3366,"Of course , Pakistan wants international attention focussed on Kashmir , and Mr. Putin also said that he supports India 's tough approach to the external violence in Kashmir as he described it ."
3367,"This is another thing that the Indians were glad to hear him say , and he also said that both India and Russia suffer from the same sort of terrorism , as he put it , referring of course to the separatist militancies in Chechnya and Russia and in Jammu and Kashmir ."
3368,So on balance I do n't think that the Indians heard anything from Mr. Putin that they did not want to hear .
3369,What sort of hold does Russia have on India and Pakistan ?
3370,"Russia has very little influence with Pakistan , but of course Russia supplies India with 70 % of its military hardware and that was of course the second pillar here of Mr. Putin 's visit , which was to finalize some very substantial arms deals ."
3371,"In fact , we 're hearing that those deals have now been finalized , that Russia will sell India 300 tanks , T - 90 tanks , very advanced tanks , that Russia will also sell to India some Sukoi - 30 bombers , fighter - bombers ."
3372,"They are going to allow India to assemble about 140 of these bombers here in India , and they are also going to finalize a deal whereby India will acquire the Admiral Gorshkov ."
3373,"That 's an old Russian aircraft carrier that India has wanted to get for some time because India only has one other aircraft carrier , and this carrier in particular would allow the Indian Navy to extend its strategic strength much farther than it currently can now ."
3374,So indeed Russia does have quite a bit of influence here .
3375,"These ties have gone way back , nearly 40 years , and they were strengthened considerably by this visit ."
3376,In fact both countries have now agreed to combat what they call terrorism with joint groups .
3377,"They have also set up a joint working group on Afghanistan , which is of course a cause of concern for both countries ."
3378,Mr. Putin 's visit is the first by a Russian leader in seven years .
3379,Why does the trip come now ?
3380,"Well , his trip has actually been delayed for a couple of years ."
3381,"Russian President was supposed to visit India as early as 97 - 1998 , but of course Boris Yeltsin 's health problems got in the way of that , and then of course , Mr. Yeltsin 's abrupt resignation last year another visit and then the subsequent election campaign and inauguration of Vladimir Putin took some time , so it 's been put off for a couple of years ."
3382,But there have also been a lot of delays in other areas .
3383,These arms agreements that we were just speaking about have taken quite some time to finalize .
3384,How does this visit by Mr. Putin compare to President Clinton 's visit earlier this year ?
3385,"That 's an interesting question because Vladimir Putin on Wednesday addressed the Indian Parliament just as Bill Clinton had done six months ago , and I think it 's safe to say that Mr. Putin actually probably accomplished more than Mr. Clinton did in the hard concrete terms of arms sales and that sort of thing , but it was Mr. Clinton that stole the Indian lawmakers ' hearts ."
3386,Of course you will recall when he spoke to the parliament there was an ecstatic welcome for him .
3387,The Indian lawmakers were sort of clambering over each other to shake his hand as he left the parliament building .
3388,"There was none of that for Mr. Putin , but he did receive a very warm welcome , although most ordinary Indians who were actually rather captivated by Mr. Clinton 's visit did not really pay much attention to Mr. Putin 's visit ."
3389,"In fact his visit has somewhat been ignored and in fact the main news story here in India has been sort of a local controversy over the roll - back of fuel prices rather than Mr. Putin 's visit , but he did do what he had to do and he certainly strengthened ties in a strategic sense between Russia and India ."
3390,That 's VOA correspondent Jim Teeple .
3391,"In a joint statement Wednesday , India and Russia called for further measures against Afghanistan 's dominant Taliban faction ."
3392,The statement accuses the Taliban of supporting international terrorism .
3393,The United States and the European Union will start lifting economic sanctions against Yugoslavia today .
3394,Among the sanctions imposed against the regime of former President Slobodan Milosevic during the fight over Kosovo are an oil embargo and a ban on commercial air traffic .
3395,French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Sunday that relieving the pressure on Belgrade 's devastated economy is the first step towards supporting the new President Vojislav Kostunica and reintegrating Yugoslavia into a democratic Europe .
3396,"Israeli helicopter gunships struck Palestinian targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , Thursday ."
3397,Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers .
3398,"This morning , the entire world was the witness of a cold - blooded brutal lynch of two or three Israelis within a Palestinian police station in Ramallah in the Palestinian - controlled territories ."
3399,"Late Thursday , Mr. Barak invited Likud opposition leader Ariel Sharon to join him in a government of national emergency ."
3400,It was a visit by Mr. Sharon to a Jerusalem religious holy site that sparked the violence that began last month between Israelis and Palestinian protesters .
3401,"UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who is leading mediation efforts in the Middle East urged Palestinians and Israelis , Thursday to show restraint ."
3402,Both Jordan 's King Abdullah and Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad charged Israel with insulting Arabs and Muslims by violating their rights at holy sites .
3403,President Clinton has told a memorial service for the victims of the deadly bomb attack on the USS Cole that justice will prevail .
3404,Mr. Clinton promised the gathering at the Norfolk Naval station Wednesday that those who carried out the deadly attack that killed 17 sailors will be found .
3405,"To those who attacked them , we say you will not find a safe harbor , we will find you and justice will prevail ."
3406,"Meanwhile , in Yemen President Ali Abdul Salay said important evidence had been uncovered in the investigation ."
3407,President Salay was quoted as saying two people responsible for the blast were killed in a suicide mission and that the attack had been planned for a long time .
3408,His comments were not immediately confirmed by US officials who are leading the investigation with Yemen 's help .
3409,The Voice of America presents differing points of view on a wide variety of issues .
3410,"Next , an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government ."
3411,This month 's visit of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to Washington is further evidence of the strengthening ties between the United States and Bangladesh .
3412,"It follows a visit last March by President Bill Clinton to Dhaka , the Bangladesh capital ."
3413,That was the first time a US President had visited Bangladesh .
3414,The US is Bangladesh 's largest trading partner and foreign investor .
3415,US investment in Bangladesh has increased over the past four years from 20 million dollars to around 800 million dollars .
3416,Prime Minister Hasina and President Clinton expressed the hope that this trend will continue .
3417,It will depend on the implementation of investor - friendly policies .
3418,"Both the US government and American businesses , welcomed the willingness of Bangladesh to embrace innovative approaches towards sustainable economic growth ."
3419,"Among other things , the US has worked with Bangladesh to establish the Tropical Forest Conservation Fund , the first of its kind in the world ."
3420,The Fund will make it possible for Bangladesh to redirect some debt repayment money to projects and at preserving unique eco-systems and protecting the environment .
3421,The Bangladesh government also deserves credit for making significant progress toward eliminating child labor in the garment industry .
3422,The US is committed to working with Bangladesh on this and other core labor standards including freedom of association and collective bargaining .
3423,"In addition to growing economic ties , the US and Bangladesh share a commitment to democracy at home and to meeting responsibilities abroad ."
3424,Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to international peacekeeping operations .
3425,"Its personnel have served with US forces in Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia , and Kosovo ."
3426,Bangladesh is also the first South Asian nation to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .

3497,US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has extended an emergency order to keep electricity flowing to California .
3498,The measure will require western suppliers to sell power to the state for at least another week .
3499,"As we hear from Michael Sullivan , the official also proposed an energy price cap for the West , but the suggestion had a mixed response from western governors ."
3500,The extension of the federal order will require power suppliers in the West to keep sending their surplus electricity to California .
3501,Electrical resources in the West Coast state are stretched to their limit with a looming threat of rolling blackouts .
3502,"California 's utility companies are not able to generate all the power their customers need , so they have turned to outside suppliers and in the face of rising prices the state 's two largest utility firms have sunk more than eight billion dollars in debt ."
3503,"Suppliers outside California had threatened to cut off the power , afraid that the cash - strapped utilities were not able to pay for it ."
3504,The emergency order last week and the extension announced in Denver at a meeting of western governors will keep electricity flowing to California through the middle of next week .
3505,"The crisis began three years ago when California imposed a price freeze on its private utility firms to protect consumers while the state deregulates its energy sector , but the lifting of market controls led to wild price fluctuations on the wholesale market ."
3506,This was made worse by several factors .
3507,No new generating stations have been built in the state in recent years and some existing generators are offline for repairs .
3508,At the same time California has been growing .
3509,Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says it is a case of demand outpacing supplies .
3510,I know in California alone in the last year electricity demand has increased 13 % .
3511,"California 's wholesale electricity prices , which had been capped at 250 dollars per megawatt hour in a regulated market , have peaked under deregulation at 1400 dollars per megawatt hour ."
3512,"With the current price freeze , utilities have been prevented from passing along the increase to consumers ."

3514,Oregon 's Governor supports the idea .
3515,Some other western leaders are not convinced that a price cap will solve the problem .
3516,"Energy suppliers oppose a cap , saying instead they need incentives to build more generating stations ."
3517,"Last week federal regulators imposed a so - called soft cap on California , which requires power firms to justify prices above 150 dollars per megawatt hour ."

3589,"In Dongguan at the turn of the 21st century , however , it is the Taiwanese business people who have been playing the leading roles ."
3590,High concentration of Taiwan firms
3591,"Before the 21st century had even arrived , a bright economic star had risen over southern China ."
3592,"Ever since economic reforms accelerated on the mainland when Deng Xiaoping made a tour of the south in early 1992 , four southern Cantonese cities - Zhongshan , Dongguan , Shunde , and Nanhai - have earned a reputation as the "" four tigers "" of Guangdong Province ."
3593,Dongguan leads the pack .

3596,In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei .
3597,"Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields ."
3598,"It has since been completely made over into a "" boundless industrial park "" with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms ."

3600,"Hong Kong firms , with their proximity and fluent Cantonese -LRB- also the local dialect in Dongguan -RRB- , were first ."
3601,"The Taiwanese , first coming about 1989 , followed ."
3602,Each arrival seemed to bring many more on its heels .
3603,Taiwan firms are now the most important source of foreign investment in Dongguan .
3604,Consider the booming electronics industry .
3605,"Eighty percent of Dongguan 's 1,800 computer - related companies are from Taiwan , Hong Kong and Macau ."
3606,"In terms of production value , they account for at least half of this RMB 50 billion local industry ."

3609,"Guangdong Province can boast one - third of the total , of which 3,200 are in Dongguan ."
3610,"Most of these are telecom , cable , plastics , shoes , electronics and electric machinery companies ."
3611,Why has Dongguan been such a magnet for Taiwan firms ?
3612,Kao Wen - lai points out that Dongguan is strategically located between Shenzhen and Guangzhou -LRB- Canton -RRB- and accessible to the entire Pearl River delta .
3613,It is three hours by car to Hong Kong and one and a half hours by boat to Humen .
3614,"When compared to Shenzhen , moreover , land and labor in Dongguan are cheap ."
3615,""" The local cadres have been smart , providing all manner of land and tax incentives , "" says Chen Ming - chih , TBAD 's secretary general ."
3616,Two keys to the miracle
3617,"One afternoon in the days before the Chinese New Year , Chinese businessmen wearing suits arrived at the People 's Government administration building in Dongguan 's Qishi district ."
3618,"After a long wait , they sat down at a table to negotiate with Qishi 's Communist Party secretary , the district chief , and various staff from its foreign economic office ."
3619,"Qishi 's factory rents , electricity charges and land leases were all focuses of discussion ."
3620,"TBAD , as is frequently the case , introduced the two parties ."
3621,""" The factory rent was set at RMB 8.00 -LRB- about NT$ 32 -RRB- a square meter ."
3622,"The electricity charge was RMB .87 a kilowatt hour , and there were various tax incentives , "" explains Wang Jung - tuo , who notes there is still room for negotiation ."
3623,"All in all , it was a very attractive package ."
3624,"In 1990 , Wang went to Malaysia thinking about opening a factory there , but he discovered that Malaysia 's market was much smaller than the mainland 's and its labor costs twice as high ."
3625,"The style of life was too different there , there was a language divide , and the roads were poor ."
3626,The mainland was a much better fit for him and his printed circuit boards company .
3627,"Now , little more than a decade later , its 20 - 30 workers have grown to 2,000 ."
3628,The company is once again preparing to expand its physical plant .
3629,"He acknowledges that it was a risky move to come to mainland China , but "" if you 're going to die , you might as well die among your own people . """
3630,"He traces his ancestry to Guangdong and affirms that his decision to set up in mainland China "" involves ethnic pride . """
3631,"Although low land and labor costs are Dongguan 's main attractions , Taiwan firms also choose the locale for the networks of people and producers that have been built up among Taiwanese in Dongguan over the last ten years ."
3632,"These two kinds of networks , says H.D. Yeh - who served as TBAD 's president for two terms - were instrumental in creating the "" Taiwanese economic miracle . """
3633,H.D. Yeh points out that competition in the 21st century is all about speed .
3634,"When customers in America make purchase orders , the whole process , including drawing up the contract and manufacturing the goods , requires four months ."
3635,But Taiwanese firms can deliver in 15 days .
3636,""" There are two keys , "" he says ."
3637,""" One is that all the upstream and downstream factories are here ."
3638,"You can assemble a computer completely from parts made within 50 kilometers . """
3639,"And the second key is that when you deal with Taiwanese companies , you do n't have to endure a long contract process ."
3640,Everything starts rolling with a single telephone call .
3641,"Taiwanese business people are always playing golf , singing karaoke or chewing betel nut together ."
3642,""" Everyone is always asking how everyone else is doing - it 's a way of networking and building up good relations , "" Yeh says ."
3643,"Andrew Yeh recalls that when the company first set up in Dongguan in 1990 , "" Even screws had to be brought in from Taiwan . """
3644,But now the company sources virtually all of the necessary raw materials and parts on the mainland and is reliant for very little on Taiwan .
3645,""" What does industrial emigration entail ?"
3646,"Usually it means downstream industries coming first , forcing the mid-stream industries to follow , "" says Sylvia Yang , deputy chairperson of TBAD 's women 's division ."
3647,"And in Dongguan downstream Taiwan firms have expanded into the mid-stream , becoming more vertically integrated ."
3648,Tahsin Printing only made paper boxes in Taiwan but when they set up a plant in Dongguan they discovered that it was hard to obtain the paper rolls they needed and thus learned how to make them themselves .
3649,Now the company makes paper boxes both from rolled paper and from colored flat paper .
3650,To each its own domain
3651,Many companies have expanded into new business realms in Dongguan .
3652,"A frequently cited example is Primax , H.D. Yeh 's electronics firm ."
3653,The company rented a factory in Dongguan in 1989 and at first produced labor - intensive power surge protectors .
3654,"After three years , they began in 1992 to invest massively on the mainland , establishing computer mouse production lines ."
3655,"Thereafter , Primax launched new products every year : cellular phone parts , overhead projectors , paper shredders , scanners . . ."
3656,"Constantly expanding its product lines and production capacity , Primax expanded from a single Dongguan plant with 25 workers in 1989 to its current nine factories and 4,000 - plus workforce ."
3657,"Primax 's performance , H.D. Yeh notes , pushed its mother company in Taiwan to go public seven years ago ."
3658,"Primax is one of the few Taiwan electronics companies with a definite "" China orientation . """
3659,""" It does n't cost much to set up a factory in mainland China , and shipping times are stable ."
3660,"These are helpful to the mother company both in terms of controlling costs and filling large orders , "" says Yeh ."
3661,"Dongguan Hsu Fu Chi Foods , which sells candy , cakes and candied fruit in the mainland domestic market , is another good example ."
3662,"They began production there in 1992 , formally opening their own plant in Dongguan in 1994 ."
3663,"The company now has three factories in Dongguan , with a combined area of 120,000 square meters , that produce 200 tons of candy , 70 tons of Chinese - style cakes , and 180 tons of gelatin and pudding a day ."
3664,""" We produce 300 - 500 container loads of food a month ."
3665,"You can find our cakes in supermarkets all the way from Guangzhou to Tibet . """
3666,"Norman Hsu , the company 's vice president , says that after one invests on the mainland , layouts of Taiwan factories seem exceedingly cramped ."
3667,""" There 's a totally different sense of space . """
3668,""" Dongguan is by itself one - thirteenth the size of Taiwan , "" notes Chen Ming - chih , secretary general of the Taiwan Business Association ."
3669,In Dongguan factories are more than ten times the sizes of similar plants in Taiwan .
3670,One factory building at the Talingshan furniture plant is 380 meters long .
3671,"Walking the perimeter of a leading electronics plant in Qishi is "" like playing four holes of golf . """
3672,"Like soldiers , workers often have to take different shifts in the cafeteria ."
3673,"The Pouchen shoe plant , Dongguan 's largest , employs 100,000 ."
3674,"The compound has a nursery , hospital and an operating room ."
3675,""" We always jokingly refer to it as Fort Pouchen , "" says Yeh ."
3676,Victory to the strivers
3677,"Although the Taiwan firms in Dongguan have left home , their success can largely be attributed to an ethos they transplanted from Taiwan - that "" victory goes to those who strive the hardest . """
3678,""" In Taiwan , we used to take the children somewhere fun on weekends and holidays , "" says Chang Mei - liang of TBAD 's women 's division ."
3679,"But since she 's moved the factory , "" there has n't been a single meal the whole family has eaten together . """
3680,"If you want to open a plant on the mainland , you 're going to have to sacrifice family intimacy . """
3681,"In Taiwan , a boss just has to set the factory 's basic course and at the very most supervise the executives , "" explains Sylvia Yang , the women 's division 's deputy chairperson ."
3682,""" But on the mainland , a boss has to supervise everything : customs , tax payments , workers ' disputes , meal preparation . . . ."
3683,"There 's always the feeling that everyone will start to slack off once the boss leaves . """
3684,All the job - related pressures and evenings out with fellow Taiwanese business people or Communist Party cadres result in ill health for many Taiwan business people on the mainland .
3685,One of Chen 's tasks as chairperson of TBAD is to handle funeral arrangements for Taiwanese business people there .
3686,""" Many of them die suddenly , "" he says ."
3687,The association has been trying to promote healthier lifestyles .
3688,""" Instead of just going out to karaoke bars and drinking , why not play golf too , "" recommends H.D. Yeh ."
3689,Dongguan has four or five golf courses within city limits .
3690,"About 1,000 people play every day , and 80 - 90 % of them are Taiwanese ."
3691,The Taiwanese entrepreneurial spirit has blossomed here by processing goods for export through Hong Kong in addition to making the most of connections between local Taiwan firms .
3692,"With 3,000 Taiwan - owned businesses here , and 10 - 20,000 Taiwanese business people and their dependants coming in and out every day , the Dong - guan area has already developed an economic circle in which Taiwan firms can conduct most of their business among themselves ."
3693,"In the vibrant district of Houjian , there is an area that locals call Taiwan Town ."
3694,"A casual look around reveals shop signs familiar to any Taiwanese : Taichung Goose , Ah - shui Shih 's Pig Knuckle Kingdom , Yungho Soy Milk , the Mantu Hair Salon . . . . and most of the customers are Taiwanese ."
3695,"Restaurants serve up authentic Taiwanese fare like "" pineapples and bitter melon chicken "" and "" sesame oil chicken . """
3696,"In November 1998 Global Express , a Taiwan firm , even opened up a shuttle bus to Hong Kong 's airport ."
3697,Global Express serves as a good example of Taiwanese corporate agility .
3698,"Originally , arrivals from Taiwan en route to Dongguan had to board buses run by a Hong Kong - based and mainland - financed travel agency ."
3699,""" But we felt that the service left something to be desired , and that a lot of time would always be wasted while holders of ' Taiwanese Compatriot Visas ' cleared customs , "" notes David Chang , Global Travel Holding 's executive director ."
3700,"Two years ago , this Taiwanese travel agency began to talk with the mainland customs and border inspection agencies and negotiated a deal to get the route ."
3701,""" We tell Taiwanese business people that riding our buses is safe , the service is good , and that it makes the trip through customs easy . """
3702,In enemy territory
3703,"As soon as you 're through customs at Hong Kong , you see them : women draped with beauty pageant - like sashes with the Chinese characters for "" Global Travel "" emblazoned across them ."
3704,"Pushing small luggage carts , they lead customers to the buses ."
3705,"They have become a "" must - see "" tourist sight for Taiwanese visitors to Dongguan ."
3706,""" At first we thought of talking with Hong Kong airport about renting a counter , "" explains Chang ."
3707,""" But for just one - fourth of a six square - meter booth , the rent comes to HK$ 200,000 . """
3708,So the company thought that instead of spending that much money on a booth it made more sense to lower operating costs and pass these along in the form of lower fares for its customers .
3709,They never expected that the luggage carts would in fact make it much easier for customers to find them in sprawling Hong Kong airport and would become an easily recognizable company trademark .
3710,""" Now mainland Chinese travel agencies have started copying the way we use the carts , "" says Chang , laughing ."
3711,"Since Global buses started plying this route in November 1988 , daily bus departures have risen from 4 to 27 , with over 20,000 riders a month ."
3712,"Global plans to introduce new services , including car rentals and plane ticket reservations and confirmations ."
3713,Dongguan appears to have a bright future .
3714,""" The Taiwan firms here now are powerful enough to get two or three members of the Legislative Yuan to represent their interests , "" holds one senior reporter ."
3715,"Although TBAD 's Yeh believes that investment prospects on the mainland are good , he does acknowledge the precariousness of their position in hostile territory ."
3716,Taiwan business interests can not put down their guard .
3717,"Because of Taiwan 's experience with rapid modernization , many CCP cadres have sought employment with Taiwanese firms , hoping to learn from the masters ."
3718,"At the first opportunity , however , they leave to set up shop for themselves ."
3719,""" The student then challenges the master , "" explains Sylvia Yang , detailing how these mainland upstarts go on to compete with the very Taiwan firms that taught them all they know ."
3720,This scenario should be familiar to Taiwanese .
3721,""" It happens in Taiwan too . """
3722,"Apart from keeping up their guard , it is even more important that Taiwan firms raise their productivity and technological level ."
3723,""" Many manufacturers , even those in mainland China , will not survive , "" says Yeh ."
3724,"Taiwan firms find it difficult to adjust to the instability of the mainland 's investment environment , as well as the laws there that seemingly change overnight ."
3725,"The year before last the mainland announced a new tax system , under which raw materials imported by foreign firms would be taxed at a rate of 17 % , with 9 % being returned to the manufacturer when finished goods were exported ."
3726,""" When I went to Beijing to negotiate , "" recalls Yeh , "" I asked cadres in the foreign trade office to consider the impact of the tax on the electronics industry ."
3727,Profit margins are at best 3 - 5 % .
3728,"How can manufacturers afford to pay a 17 % import tax ? """
3729,"In June of last year the PRC authorities announced the "" Document # 35 "" rules ."
3730,These stipulated that companies would be given grades according to the quantity of their exports and their records of breaking customs regulations .
3731,Those meriting only a B would have to offer a deposit of 40 - 50 % against the value of their raw material imports .
3732,This terrified Taiwan firms in Dongguan .
3733,"According to TBAD 's statistics , 75 % of the Taiwanese firms were given Bs ."
3734,"The announcement caused quite a stir , but its effect on Taiwanese investment is as yet unclear ."
3735,"In August of last year , as the mainland customs authorities took aggressive moves against smuggling , 12 Taiwan business people in Dongguan were detained ."
3736,The charges ran the gamut from not filling out proper forms to purchasing phony export contracts and trying to pass them off to customs .
3737,Seven business people were arrested and charged with smuggling and are still in jail .
3738,""" I 'm constantly thinking about them ."
3739,"I 'm meditating and have gone vegetarian , but I 'm still not at peace , "" Yeh says ."
3740,"On the mainland , the highest penalty for smuggling is death ."
3741,""" Last year the mainland sent nine customs officers to the firing squad , "" notes Yeh ."
3742,The fate of these Taiwanese businessmen will depend entirely on the mainland 's political climate .
3743,"Whether its arrival was by accident or design , a new age for Taiwanese firms in Dongguan is here ."
3744,It is a far cry from the days when Taiwan firms enjoyed tremendous advantages .
3745,"From the various revisions to trade law adopted by the PRC last year , Chang Han - wen extrapolates that the PRC both wants to protect its uncompetitive state firms and turn from low - tech processing to high - tech production ."
3746,""" This is because state enterprises pressure the government with appeals about their right to survival , "" Yeh says ."
3747,"When foreign firms in the mainland are confronted with threats to their safety and property , "" Hong Kong can count on the cooperation of the government , US and Japanese businesses can turn to their ambassadors , but what can Taiwan firms do ? "" asks Yeh ."
3748,In Dongguan they can help each other .
3749,"Currently , more than 80 % of the 3,000 Taiwanese firms in Dongguan have joined TBAD ."
3750,"TBAD has 29 local branches in Dongguan and is , moreover , the only Taiwan business association in mainland China with a women 's division ."
3751,"Major companies listed on the TAIEX , including Lite - on Electronics and Delta Electronics , are members of TBAD ."
3752,It is the largest and strongest of all Taiwan business groups on the mainland both in terms of organization and operations .
3753,"Many Taiwanese believe that at a time of cross-strait tension , Taiwan firms have made their own decisions to invest in the mainland and therefore should bear the risk themselves too ."
3754,"And by investing their money , technology and so forth on the mainland , are they not to some degree abandoning Taiwan ?"
3755,TBAD takes issue with this view .
3756,"H.D. Yeh points out that in 1998 Taiwan had an overall trade surplus of US$ 5.9 billion , and a surplus of US$ 12.76 billion with mainland China ."
3757,"If not for its trade with the PRC , therefore , Taiwan would have had a trade deficit ."
3758,""" We make our money here , but we pay taxes in Taiwan , and most of our families and children do most of their consumer spending in Taiwan , "" insists TBAD chairperson Chang Mei - liang ."
3759,"Chang notes that after the major earthquake in Taiwan on September 21 , Taiwan business associations throughout mainland China contributed NT$ 60 million ."
3760,TBAD contributed NT$ 30 million all by itself .
3761,"Hence , he argues that it 's very unfair to say that Taiwanese businesses in the mainland are n't contributing to Taiwan ."
3762,"The question is , how should the ROC government view Taiwan firms in the mainland ?"
3763,And for that matter how is the PRC government looking at the Taiwanese in Dongguan ?
3764,TBAD 's spiritual leader H.D. Yeh often goes to Beijing to represent Taiwan firms in negotiations with the government .
3765,"Once , in the presence of many Communist Party cadres , a high - ranking official of the State Council 's Taiwan Affairs Office asked him this question : "" You 've gathered so many Taiwan firms in Dongguan and stirred up such enthusiasm among them - but for what purpose ? """
3766,It threw him for a loop .
3767,Yeh is still trying to figure out what the mainland authorities think of TBAD .
3768,"For Taiwan firms in Dongguan , investing in mainland China is a road of no return ."
3769,""" In recent years many Taiwan business people have also tried to invest in Vietnam , only later to close their factories there , "" says Chang Han - wen ."
3770,Mainland China shares the same language as Taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions .
3771,It would be surprising if it did n't attract Taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore .
3772,"Amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that Taiwan firms in Dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss ."

3779,Thomas Lu is the doyen of the Chinese news media .
3780,"Still out on the journalistic front lines at 81 , this spry , forthright veteran has an immense zest for life ."
3781,"At 78 , drawing on his astonishingly sharp memory , he completed his reminiscences and "" record of emotional regrets . """
3782,"He is not only one of the "" wonders "" of Taiwan 's journalistic world , but is also recognized by those of his generation as a gentleman and a "" good - looking man . """
3783,A person 's looks change with their age and their state of mind .
3784,Many friends have told me I look better the older I get .
3785,"People do n't know that when I was young I had dreadful protruding teeth , but now not only do my teeth no longer show , but the lines of my face have also softened ."
3786,"People who know me know that there have always been two great loves in my life : the news , and women ."
3787,"Now that I 'm in my 80s , looking back I think I can say I 've done alright in both respects , and I 've learnt that both reporting the news well , and finding favor with women , depend on your character and conduct ."
3788,"Journalism is not just a profession , but should also be a vocation - you have to throw yourself fully into this infinitely broad field of endeavor ."
3789,"Intellectually and spiritually , in work and in love , I have gained experience and fulfilment ."
3790,I have always remembered the encouragement which Mr. Yu Youren gave me as a young reporter .
3791,"He said that to be a fearless champion of social justice , as is expected of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty ."
3792,"You have to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed by the great and powerful ."
3793,"A president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated the same way ."
3794,"Funnily enough , an unassuming attitude is also advantageous in relations with the opposite sex ."
3795,"Chinese society is male dominated , and women are mostly regarded as having a subsidiary role ."
3796,"In this kind of unfair situation , an upstanding man should cherish and respect women all the more ."
3797,A considerate attitude can be expressed in little things .
3798,"For instance , when you see that a hair has fallen onto a female friend 's shoulder , you should lightly pick it off for her , and throw it away or put it in your pocket ."
3799,"If sincere , this kind of action is attractive in a man ."
3800,"If a woman expresses her liking for you , then no matter whether she is pretty , or whether you find her attractive , you should respond in the same way , and with the same respect ."
3801,"When I was a young reporter stationed in Europe , there was a British woman reporter who liked me very much ."
3802,"Once I was driving her somewhere to report a story when we had an accident , and she suffered some badly broken bones ."
3803,"Although I was n't attracted to her in that way , I went to see her every day in hospital , and this left a deep impression on her of how considerate Chinese men can be ."
3804,"Looking back at my life , I 've hardly had any really bad experiences in my relationships with women , and this is because just as in my professional life , I 've always maintained a self - critical attitude towards my emotions , and always tried to prevent myself acting like a male chauvinist ."
3805,"Looks are something you are born with , but character is something you can work on , and it can outweigh your appearance ."
3806,"Luo Jialun , one of the leading lights of the May Fourth Movement , is a famous example ."
3807,"Luo was not good looking , and was even ridiculed as "" looking like a cross between a pig , a dog and a bear . """
3808,"But he was tremendously well - read , had a beautiful writing style , and for a time he was Chinese ambassador to India ."
3809,"His wife was a universally admired beauty , the envy of all ."
3810,"So I say , "" handsome is as handsome does . """
3811,"I was imprisoned by both the Kuomintang and the Communists , and at times I might have been killed ."
3812,"Perhaps other people in the same situation might have wallowed in self - pity , but I saw it as a rare opportunity in life ."
3813,"In 1951 , in a dark prison cell during a big Communist purge , what came into my mind was not fear of death ."
3814,"Instead , I wondered what kind of headline my death would merit in the newspapers ."
3815,""" 10,000 Rush to See Lu Executed "" ?"
3816,Perhaps it was this eternal optimism which changed my frame of mind and my appearance .
3817,This is the advice I 'd like to give young people :
3818,"it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look ."
3819,But do n't overdo it .
3820,"It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive ."
3821,Powerful Tools for Biotechnology - Biochips
3822,-LRB- Chang Chiung - fang / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
3823,"The enterovirus detection biochip developed by DR. Chip Biotechnology takes only six hours to give hospitals the answer to whether a sample contains enterovirus , and if it is the deadly strain Entero 71 ."
3824,"Worldwide , biotechnology is a rising star of the industrial stage ."
3825,"In Taiwan , in recent years the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the National Science Council and the National Health Research Institutes have been strongly pursuing "" biochip "" research programs ."
3826,"In the last two years , three biochip companies have also been set up in Taiwan ."
3827,Just what are biochips ?
3828,What use are they to mankind ?
3829,Why do so many people have such confidence in their future ?
3830,What is the current state of this field in Taiwan ?
3831,And what are the prospects for future development ?
3832,Let 's take a closer look .
3833,"In just a few years ' time , or a few decades , the following scenario could become a reality :"
3834,"When you 're feeling under the weather , all you need to do is buy a diagnostic biochip from the chemist 's shop , put a drop of urine onto it , and you will find out what is wrong with you - a health check will be as easy as a pregnancy test today ."
3835,Everyone will carry with them a biochip bearing a record and analysis of their own DNA .
3836,"From it one will not only be able to see one 's own physical condition , but even to predict what diseases one will have in the future ."
3837,"It will be like an ID card , needed when looking for work , buying insurance or even seeking a partner for love and marriage ."
3838,"Laboratories will no longer need all kinds of large instruments , for all stages of their experiments will be carried out on little biochips , saving time , effort and money ."
3839,"Today , the scenes outlined above may just seem like pipe dreams ."
3840,"But these dreams could yet come true , and the key to that happening is those little biochips ."
3841,A dream come true ?
3842,"Developments such as the sequencing of the human genome and the rapid development of genetic engineering have spawned biotechnology industries like bioinformatics , biomaterials and pharmaceutical engineering , which have emerged as the rising stars of 21st - century industry ."
3843,"As part of the government 's efforts to promote the biotechnology industry in Taiwan , in July 1999 the Industrial Technology Research Institute -LRB- ITRI -RRB- set up the Biomedical Engineering Center -LRB- BMEC -RRB- to actively develop biomedical engineering technologies ."
3844,Biochips are one of the core technologies in the field .
3845,BMEC general director Dr. Johnsee Lee says that the ITRI 's four - year R&D program in biochip applications and technology is now in its second year .
3846,"Its initial objectives are mainly focused on developing sensor chips to screen for infectious diseases , while later goals will be to develop technologies to test for genetic diseases and cancers ."
3847,"As well as this new research establishment , in the two years since September 1998 three commercial companies have been set up in Taiwan to make biochips : U - Vision Biotech , Taiwan Genome Sciences and DR. Chip Biotechnology ."
3848,"Of these , DR. Chip attracted much attention this year when it developed a chip to detect enteroviruses , a deadly epidemic of which has gripped Taiwan over the last two years ."
3849,Fever chips
3850,DR. Chip Bio-technology was set up in September 1998 .
3851,Vice president Wang Shin - hwan states that the company successfully applied to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for funding to help it pursue a development program for enterovirus detection chips and test technology .
3852,"Today , the enterovirus chip is in the testing phase , and DR. Chip is collaborating with Taipei Veterans General Hospital to obtain samples with which to establish the accuracy of the chip ."
3853,What is so remarkable about the enterovirus detection chip when compared with traditional test methods ?
3854,There are 68 known forms of non-polio enterovirus .
3855,"The detection chip does not simply determine whether a person is infected with enterovirus , but can also differentiate between different virus groups , for instance showing whether a sample contains the deadly Entero 71 virus , or Coxsackie A16 , which is easily confused with Entero 71 ."
3856,"In addition , the chip and its accompanying PCR kit greatly reduce the time required for testing ."
3857,"Wang Shin - hwan notes that traditional bacterial and viral cultures take seven to ten days to prepare , and even with the newer molecular biology testing techniques it takes three days to get a result ."
3858,"But DR. Chip has developed methods to reduce the sample preparation time , which enables a result to be obtained in only six hours when used in combination with their enterovirus chip ."
3859,"Furthermore , the initial results of joint trials by DR. Chip , Chang Gung University and National Cheng Kung University suggest that the chip is over a thousand times more sensitive than traditional test methods ."
3860,""" In addition to enterovirus , we plan to develop chips to detect other infectious diseases such as hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV , "" says Wang Shin - hwan ."
3861,"Apart from the enterovirus chip , which is already at the testing stage , the ITRI 's Molecular Biomedical Technology Division is also conducting research and development on biochip applications and technology ."
3862,"Research program director Pan Chao - chi states that at present they are actively developing a "" fever chip "" with a wide range of applications ."
3863,"Pan explains that in clinical practice , the causes of fever are difficult to quickly diagnose ."
3864,"A "" fever chip "" bearing the DNA of common fever - causing viruses and bacteria could be used to determine the cause of the fever and the type of pathogen involved would be a valuable tool ."
3865,"However , Pan points out that because of the difficulties in substantially reducing the time needed for sample preparation , the usefulness of such a fever chip is still limited , so that it can not yet be widely promoted ."
3866,Where the real money is
3867,"At present , most applications for biochips are in academic research and the development of new pharmaceutical drugs ."
3868,Demand for them is growing rapidly .
3869,"Johnsee Lee says that according to US market research estimates , the worldwide annual consumption of microarray chips is currently around 250,000 ; in two years this is expected to grow to 1.2 million ."
3870,"Based on a market price per chip of US$ 1,000 , the size of the world market in biochips could grow to US$ 1.2 billion in 2003 , and to US$ 40 billion over the next decade ."
3871,"Thus some people have set their sights on the biochip market , and believe that following Taiwan 's success in the semiconductor field , the island could go on to be a major center for contract manufacture of biochips ."
3872,"Be that as it may , the small number of biochip companies so far established in Taiwan still find their market in domestic research establishments and pharmaceuticals manufacturers ."
3873,"Although they are also actively developing overseas markets , what interests them most is not biochips per se , nor are they content merely to be contract manufacturers ."
3874,""" The chips are only a tool , and the big money is not in chip sales ."
3875,"What counts is the R&D behind them . """
3876,"Jerry Huang , executive vice president of U - Vision Biotech , reveals that U - Vision , which was set up in September 1999 , has signed a contract with the US company Zen - Bio to jointly develop human adipocyte cDNA microarray chips ."
3877,"Huang states that research in recent years has revealed that adipocytes -LRB- fat cells -RRB- are active regulators of the energy balance in the body , and play an important role in disorders such as obesity , diabetes , osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease ."
3878,Thus it is hoped that research into human adipocytes can help in the search for drugs and other therapies to treat these disorders .
3879,"Apart from this , U - Vision is also conducting a one - year bacterial genome project , which aims to map the genome of a certain drug - resistant bacterium as a basis for developing new vaccines and drugs ."
3880,Drug development
3881,"Taiwan Genome Sciences -LRB- TGS -RRB- , which was set up in November 1999 as a joint venture by the Uni-President Enterprises Group , Yuen Foong Yu and Tuntex Groups , only entered the biotechnology fray in April of this year ."
3882,"CEO Andrew Kuo says the investors came to the view that Taiwan needs to develop its biotechnology industries , and therefore they combined their resources to make a long - term investment in the field ."
3883,"TGS 's strategy is to invest in a number of US genome research companies , and to sign technology transfer agreements and chip production contracts with them ."
3884,Kuo comments that contract production of chips is merely a service activity and a source of income for the company - TGS 's ultimate goal is in doing R&D work to identify gene sequences as targets for developing new drugs .
3885,"Kuo states that at present , the number of known target sequences for disease - treating drugs is only around 500 , but as the human genome is mapped out this number can be expected to increase tenfold ."
3886,"Currently , TGS has its sights set mainly on doing research into diseases which are especially prevalent in Asia , such as liver and stomach cancers ."
3887,A chip revolution
3888,"However , the potential uses for biochips go far beyond the medical applications outlined above ."
3889,"Dr. Johnsee Lee , who as well as heading up the Biomedical Engineering Center is also general director of Union Chemical Laboratories , a research institute under the ITRI umbrella , says that due to biochips ' advantages of miniaturization , parallelism , speed and the ability to reveal the "" big picture , "" they have a very wide range of applications ."
3890,"They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing ."
3891,"Biochips come in two main types : the microfluidics chip or "" lab - on - a - chip , "" and the microarray chip or "" DNA chip . """
3892,"Microfluidics chips bring together biotechnology , microelectronics , micromachining and other technologies to integrate the functions of multiple laboratory instruments onto a single chip in miniaturized form ."
3893,"Meanwhile on microarray chips , biological molecules such as gene segments , oligonucleotides , proteins or antibodies are bound to the chip surface in an array of tiny spots , and a single chip may carry many tens of thousands of such spots ."
3894,BMEC researcher Pan Chao - chi uses the example of blood screening for a blood bank to illustrate the difference between the two kinds of chips .
3895,"To test a blood sample using a microarray chip , the sample must first go through many preparatory steps such as purification , nucleotide extraction , copying , amplification and labeling before being put onto the chip where the "" hybridization "" reaction takes place ."
3896,"Finally , the results are analyzed using a detection system ."
3897,Hence these chips are only suitable for use in the laboratory .
3898,"In contrast , with a lab - on - a - chip system , all the laboratory preparation stages will be done on the chip itself , so that the user need only place a drop of blood directly onto the chip to obtain a result ."
3899,"At present , microfluidics technology is not yet mature , and no such chips have been launched as commercial products anywhere ."
3900,"But , says Pan Chao - chih : "" This is the way future biochip development will go . """
3901,The poor man 's chip
3902,"Future prospects also seem infinite for microarray chips , which are already widely used in laboratories and research establishments ."
3903,Jerry Huang notes that DNA chips are an indispensable research tool in molecular biology .
3904,"On one little biochip , tens of thousands of gene segments can be arranged to simultaneously detect the expression of tens of thousands of genes ."
3905,"In other words , whereas in the past researchers had to investigate each gene individually , today , using biochips , they can obtain test results for tens of thousands of genes at once ."
3906,"In particular , biochips not only can speed the pace of research , but can also replace laboratory animals such as rats and rabbits in many experiments , with tests being carried out directly on human genes on the chip ."
3907,"Thus as research tools biochips are not only convenient and quick , but also more humane ."
3908,"Dr. Konan Peck , an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica 's Institute of Biomedical Sciences -LRB- IBMS -RRB- , says that biochips need to be made more widely available as a molecular biology research tool ."
3909,"With this in mind , Peck has developed nylon - based biochips which have been called "" the poor man 's biochip , "" since they cost a third less than glass chips ."
3910,"Apart from the material itself being cheaper , the nylon chips use a visible - spectrum colorimetric system to display results , so that they can be read using an ordinary optical scanner , which costs 50 - 70 % less than using a special laser detector ."
3911,The nylon membrane biochips currently produced by TGS and U - Vision Biotech are all derived from the technology developed by Konan Peck .
3912,Cutting edge
3913,"Can Taiwan really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry , to become a major production center for biochips ?"
3914,"BMEC director Johnsee Lee observes that the level of scientific and technical know - how required for biochip production is very high , so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited ."
3915,"However , due to Taiwan 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills ."
3916,"Thus , says Lee , "" Taiwan should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . """
3917,"The potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome ."
3918,"Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player ."
3919,""" Because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , "" says Johnsee Lee ."
3920,"In his view , this problem may be resolved in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players ."
3921,"In other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations ."
3922,"At present , the BMEC has over 10 patents pending in the areas of microfluidics biochips , chip surface processing technology and probe design and applications ."
3923,Pushing the envelope
3924,"Although at their present stage of development , biochips are already a great help to researchers , they are still far removed from ordinary people 's lives ."
3925,But one day they will play an important role in all our lives .
3926,""" Applications and commercialization are our goal , "" says Johnsee Lee ."
3927,He says that only if research results are commercialized does research produce an economic payback .
3928,"Equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users ."
3929,"Lee points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low ."
3930,"He predicts that in one to two years , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today ."
3931,"IBMS associate research fellow Konan Peck agrees that in the foreseeable future , diagnostic chips will enable everyone to learn their current state of health and know what diseases they may develop in the future ."
3932,"But in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology , the medical problems so discovered may not be treatable ."
3933,"Mankind is always challenging his limits , and when , in the near future , biochips lift the veil of many diseases , the next challenge will have only just begun ."
3934,"Turning to the Constitution on the "" One China "" Issue"
3935,"Still wrestling with the vexed issue of "" one China , "" the President 's Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations met for its sixth and seventh sessions during November , amid frenzied media attention ."
3936,"The group eventually reached a consensus that the "" one China "" principle advocated by the mainland should be addressed "" in accordance with the constitution . """
3937,"How president Chen Shui - bian responds to this proposal will determine whether or not the "" one China "" stalemate can be broken , and if there is to be a set timetable for implementing the three direct links ."
3938,"After assuming the presidency , Chen Shui - bian recruited a number of leading politicians , industrialists , academics and other personages for a non-partisan advisory group , intended to build cross-party consensus on the subject of relations with the mainland ."
3939,"Chaired by Academia Sinica president Lee Yuan - tseh , the Presidential Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations first met in early September ."
3940,Since then the Group has held a series of intensive discussions on Taiwan 's fundamental position regarding the cross-strait relationship .
3941,"The Group entered the final phase of discussions on the "" one China "" issue during November , but differences between pro-unification and pro-independence participants continued to stymie the effort to produce a statement acceptable to all ."
3942,"As DPP legislator Shen Fu - hsiung pointed out , the Group had to draft something "" palatable both to the pro-unification and pro-independence camps ; something which the DPP ca n't shun and yet which does n't make Beijing wince . """
3943,Clearly no easy task .
3944,"On the evening of November 18 Advisory Group chairman Lee Yuan - tseh , meeting over dinner with DPP faction leaders , described the cross-strait situation as extremely precarious , and said that since time is not on Taiwan 's side we need to step up efforts to resume dialogue with the mainland ."
3945,"Separately , during his report to the Legislative Yuan on the Academia Sinica 's budget , Lee reiterated : "" If the whole population could arrive at a consensus on ' one China , ' then President Chen would have no grounds for not accepting that consensus . """
3946,"Lee added that he hoped the Advisory Group would shortly come to a firm conclusion on the "" one China "" issue ."
3947,"Lee Yuan - tseh 's appeal made little impression on the governing DPP , however ."
3948,"Furthermore , DPP chairman Frank Hsieh himself came under fire within the party after stating : "" The constitution of the ROC is itself a one China framework ."
3949,"Since the DPP has participated in the process of constitutional amendment it ought to accept this constitution , and as the party of government we ca n't afford to override or reject it . """
3950,"According to DPP lawmaker Lin Cho - shui , Chen Shui - bian has shown more goodwill to Beijing as president than Lee Teng - hui ever did , but without any response -"
3951,"so why should he once again be expected to respond on the "" one China "" issue ?"
3952,"Also , Lin disagrees with Lee Yuan - tseh 's assertion that "" time is not on our side , "" and instead feels that things are no worse than before ."
3953,"Meanwhile , the opposition alliance has been calling for the DPP to "" shed its ideological baggage . """
3954,"On November 24 the New Party , which had already pulled out of the Advisory Group , published an article in the press signed by leading members such as Yu Mu - ming and Chen Kui - miao , in which they called on the government to take the constitution as its starting point for breaking the "" one China "" deadlock ."
3955,"They pointed out that Chen and the DPP had competed in elections in accordance with the constitution , winning the presidency and a share of seats in the legislature and the National Assembly , and had also participated in the process of revising the constitution ."
3956,"Now , with its constitutionally granted mandate , the party has an obligation to fully uphold the constitution ."
3957,"As the politicians argued , Formosa Plastics boss Wang Yung - ching convened a meeting with other captains of industry to come up with some advice for the government on economic policy ."
3958,"For the first time Wang voiced support for Lee Yuan - tseh 's proposal that "" with ' one China ' as the precondition , each side can have its own interpretation . """
3959,"Wang also agreed with Lee 's notion that time is running out for Taiwan , in the belief that Taiwan will only have time on its side once it starts to carry out well - intentioned engagement with the mainland ."
3960,"Consensus on the "" one China question "" is an urgent priority for both sides if there is to be a peaceful future ."
3961,"Wang Yung - ching 's demand for a review of the government 's "" go slow "" policy , and opening of the three direct links , brought a personal phone call from the president , who invited him to come and discuss policy ."
3962,On November 25 Wang and a handful of other leading industrialists went to call on the president at his official residence .
3963,"The businessmen said that shelving the "" one China "" issue was not the right thing for the government to do , and that Taiwan could no longer afford to play word games ."
3964,"They stressed the need for early restoration of the mechanism for cross-strait economic dialogue , and said that the government should also think about moving towards political dialogue ."
3965,"The Presidential Advisory Group met again on November 26 , and discussed a proposal , made earlier by Public Television System chairman Wu Feng - shan and already favored by most members of the Group , for "" one China "" to be addressed through "" three acknowledgements and four suggestions . """
3966,"A firm consensus was finally arrived at , and the Group submitted to the president its proposal that Taiwan should "" respond to the mainland 's ' one China ' proposition in accordance with the constitution of the ROC . """
3967,The government and opposition parties continued to disagree regarding this consensus .
3968,"DPP legislator Lin Cho - shui described it as "" acceptable , if not very satisfactory . """
3969,"PFP spokesman Li Ching - an called it "" a conclusion without a conclusion . """
3970,"New Party convenor Hau Lung - pin said the statement was too ambiguous , tending towards "" one China , with each side free to make its own interpretation , "" and added that it was highly unlikely to be used by the president as a guide for cross-strait policy ."
3971,"Ting Shou - chung , deputy executive director of the KMT policy committee , said this so - called consensus was simply a case of going round and round on the spot , and would do nothing to solve the core problem ."
3972,"In a November 28 press release , the Mainland Affairs Council -LRB- MAC -RRB- , the government body in charge of cross-strait affairs , diplomatically stated that it would observe and implement the suggestions of the Advisory Group if and when they become official government policy ."
3973,"Speaking on the topic of the three direct links , MAC chairwoman Tsai Ing - wen said that these will be phased in according to conditions , with the first phase being the opening of direct business links as necessitated by the admission of both sides to the WTO ."
3974,"And according to economics minister Lin Hsin - yi , the government recognizes that the "" go slow "" policy needs to be relaxed , and will give a more thorough accounting of this before the end of the year ."

3977,"In paintings , a white cloud layer swirls over Mt. Kuanyin ;"
3978,waves on the river drift like a breeze ;
3979,a red sun dances on golden water ;
3980,a yellow moon sings from a deep purple sky . . . .
3981,"The Tanshui of illustrations is a place of unblemished beauty , a myth that remains unshakeable ."
3982,"In the 300 - plus years since its founding , this port town - formerly called Huwei , now Tanshui Township - has seen days of prosperity and has also been through a baptism of fire ."
3983,What makes it special among the 309 urban and rural townships of Taiwan ?
3984,How do the people of Tanshui live today ?
3985,How do they recall the past ?
3986,And how do they see the future ?
3987,""" You want to know how Tanshui has changed ?"
3988,"I would say that the biggest change is that the old streets are gone . """
3989,"So declares Tu Hsiu - yuan , proprietor of the Hui Yuan Pharmacy , and also director of the Huwei Cultural and Historical Workshop ."
3990,"His pharmacy is located on what is now called Chungcheng Road , one of the oldest streets , which Tanshui natives still call Huwei Street ."
3991,"Tu , who has lived his whole life in the old neighborhood , has watched from his doorstep as old shops have refurbished themselves in modern style , and modern shops have adopted the look of the old ."
3992,"For the convenience of cars , the streets have been widened repeatedly ."
3993,"In 1988 , the last train on the old Tanshui Line of the railroad chugged into history , taking that old slower pace of life with it ."
3994,"In 1997 the Tanshui Line of the mass rapid transit system opened , bringing floods of visitors to the town ."
3995,"Yet , while these tourists bring a human touch to the streets on weekends and holidays , on ordinary weekdays the silence is accompanied only by leftover garbage , empty shops , and those Huwei people who refuse to leave their old homes ."
3996,The golden age of Huwei
3997,"There are different explanations as to the origins of the word Huwei , the original name for Tanshui ."
3998,Some say it was a transliteration of the place name used by the indigenous people .
3999,"But others say it comes from a long - gone fishing practice , using a shi hu -LRB- "" stone pool "" -RRB- ."
4000,"Early fishermen used stones to carve a long , narrow catchment -LRB- the so - called "" pool "" -RRB- in the sand , waiting for the tide to carry in fish which they could then easily scoop up ."
4001,"Since the place now known as Tanshui was at the tail end -LRB- wei -RRB- of this stone pool , it came to be called Huwei ."
4002,Tanshui occupied an important place in the transport network connecting Taiwan to Southeast Asia .
4003,"Even before the arrival of Westerners in Taiwan , Han Chinese often crossed over from China to Tanshui , which is relatively close to the mainland ."
4004,"Here they engaged in barter trade with the Pingpu -LRB- meaning "" plains "" -RRB- aborigines , with deer skins and sulphur being the most coveted products ."
4005,"As Western powers turned their eyes to Asia , Tanshui became strategically important ."
4006,"In the 17th century , first the Spanish , and then the Dutch , built forts here as symbols of their claims to territorial control ."
4007,"In the mid-17th century , China took control of Taiwan , and closed Tanshui to international trade ."
4008,"Later , as a result of the Sino - French war of 1884 , Tanshui was again opened up to Western access ."
4009,"During Tanshui 's golden age , large and small boats were constantly coming and going in the harbor , and it was not unusual to see enormous steamships ."
4010,"In the latter part of the Qing dynasty , Tanshui was the largest port in Taiwan , and was the "" customs headquarters , "" also charged with overseeing port activities at Keelung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung ."
4011,"However , during the Japanese occupation , as a result of silting , and because the Japanese invested a huge effort in developing the port at Keelung , Tanshui faded in importance , never again to see the likes of its glory days ."
4012,"Tanshui is a place of many historic sites , a place that invites reflection on things past ."
4013,"In the "" foreign district , "" a missionary named George Mackay established the first hospital for Western medicine in Taiwan ; it was here that in 1878 the first case of paragonimiasis in the world was diagnosed ."
4014,The old church next to the hospital is a mecca for Tanshui painters .
4015,"The schools , homes , and consulates in the foreign district - some long gone , some still standing - testify to the fact that this was a place of intensive interaction between Chinese and Western cultures ."
4016,"If you go up Sanmin Street , you will discover the head of an old and disused water pipe ."
4017,"This could be a relic left behind by one of the major Japanese infrastructure projects , the first tap water station ."
4018,"Or you could walk instead next to the MRT station and see another first for Taiwan : the first seaplane landing area , also built in the Japanese occupation era ."
4019,Or you could visit the venerable Tamkang Secondary School .
4020,"As you watch the children laughing and arguing and playing , you can think back to the time when the Japanese government did not allow Taiwanese and Japanese to attend school together ."
4021,"Under those circumstances , Tamkang Middle School became a cradle for the training of Taiwanese elites ."
4022,Gradually you will discover that Tanshui is a bookish place .
4023,This little town has everything from nursery schools to graduate schools .
4024,"During the reign of the Guangxu emperor of the Qing dynasty -LRB- which began in 1875 -RRB- , and prior to the beginning of the Japanese occupation in 1895 , Tanshui produced two successful candidates in the highest level military exam , one in the highest level civil exam , and countless successes in lower - level imperial exams ."
4025,"Even in modern times , the town has not passed up chances to embrace knowledge : When the idea of founding Tam - kang University in Tanshui was going to be abandoned because of a lack of land and money , local residents offered cheap land , donated money , and lobbied so that the university could set its roots in town ."
4026,"These historic sites are near the river , but do n't spend all your time there ."
4027,"Do n't forget the Tatun Mountains , which shelter the town ."
4028,"In the old days , Tanshui folk who cultivated farms on the slopes had to walk for an hour to get to their crops ."
4029,These days you can take a local mini-bus .
4030,In the mountains you will see the occasional terraced field grown over with weeds .
4031,"This land , which has gone from grass to grain and back to grass again , is where many an old Tanshui native played when they were children ."
4032,The Tanshui mystique
4033,The mountains are also filled with old stories .
4034,The often - renovated Hsing Chung Tang shop is more than a century old .
4035,"Owner Li Yung - kun is a descendant of the eminent Li family of Tanshui , which produced three juren -LRB- a successful candidate in provincial - level exams , held every three years -RRB- ."
4036,"The house testifies to this past : It has a swallow - tailed roof and a flagpole , features that only the home of a juren was entitled to have ."
4037,"Li Mingbin -LRB- whose name by birth is Li Minghui -RRB- , a scholar from Beijing University currently working at Chinese Culture University on an exchange program , is a descendant of the juren Li Yingzhen , who was wounded resisting the Japanese occupation and fled to the mainland , where he settled down ."
4038,"Like his elders , Li Mingbin bridges the gap across the Taiwan Strait , as he is capable of conversing fluently in either Beijing dialect or the southern Fujian dialect used in Taiwan ."
4039,"Of course , stories do n't have to be old to be interesting ."
4040,Today 's Tanshui residents are living their own stories .
4041,"The crotchety but modest guy who delivers the newspapers , the seafood restaurant owner who has made his fortune from scratch , the old man at the roadside food stall , the hostess in the tea house greeting and sending off guests . . . ."
4042,"Some are active in the early morning , some late at night ."
4043,"Though the founders of many of these shops have passed away , the second generation has taken the baton ."
4044,"In the old bamboo tea shop , the now elderly hostess still plays her role amidst the ambience of wine and tea , offering a feminine presence to help put at ease her customers who come looking for a little relaxation , evoking the bewitching atmosphere of Tanshui at night ."
4045,"Businessmen from outside , smelling profits , have set up gaudy storefronts and neon signs , hoping to trade on Tanshui 's mystique to sell coffee , seafood , antiques , and snack foods ."
4046,"Students , who have enough money to keep several streets of shops going , carelessly wheel their motorcycles through the narrow streets , their minds elsewhere , thinking of youthful fun or romance ."
4047,"Happy couples and jilted lovers line the river , displaying their joy or sadness in their postures : two people 's shadows are melted together by the darkened river behind , while others stand alone on the riverbank like statues ."
4048,The weeping river
4049,Have you heard of the weeping junks ?
4050,"During the Sino - French war , Taiwan governor Liu Mingchuan , attempting to obstruct a French landing , scuttled several of these boats ."
4051,"It is said that , late at night , the sunken junks make moaning sounds ."
4052,But I think that it may be the river itself that is moaning .
4053,"In 1998 , the government produced a plan for a riverside expressway to Tanshui ."
4054,"The road , which was expected to have three levels , would have cut through rare mangroves and created a barrier between the river and the town of Tanshui ."
4055,"If the plan had been implemented , people who wanted to go to Tanshui and gaze out over the river would have had to find some very high vantage point in town to do so !"
4056,"Fortunately , thanks to efforts by cultural and environmental activists from Tanshui , the plan was first postponed , and then was ultimately killed after an environmental impact assessment released in September refused to approve the scheme ."
4057,But a question remains : Is something like this bound to come sooner or later ?
4058,""" For the purposes of development , the Tanshui coast has been constantly exploited ."
4059,"But what will be result of this incessant struggle against nature ? "" says an agitated Tu Hsiu - yuan ."
4060,"And Hsieh Teh - hsi of the Tamsui Culture Foundation adds : "" High - rises are going up one after another in Tanshui New Town [ a huge government - planned development ] , but many of the apartments remain empty ."
4061,"Everybody here knows that when the northeast winds blow in during the winter , that is the coldest place around ."
4062,"No wonder those apartments are not selling ! """
4063,"Tu says , with disbelief and exasperation in his voice : "" Do you know that they are going to build a huge bridge between Tanshui and Pali ?"
4064,"It 's such a beautiful and historic location , but they are just going to stick up a bridge there , and they are even talking about having a rotating restaurant on top ! """
4065,"Lovers of Tanshui , while keeping close watch over her , are fearful that the giant beast of development may eventually come and bulldoze Tanshui away one piece of land at a time ."
4066,"They fear that their children , like they themselves , will have to search through photographs and memories to find Tanshui 's traditional simplicity and the joys of being close to nature ."
4067,"When the old buildings are gone , and people lose contact with the great outdoors , will Tanshui even be worthy of its reputation anymore ?"
4068,Scattered wooden fishing boats bob in the river .
4069,I have n't met any of the fishermen who these days go out and catch only small fry .
4070,They might relate how in the old days they could just put a hand in the river and come up with a big catch .
4071,The lonely fishing boats are waiting for the Tanshui - Pali ferry to pass by and say hello .
4072,"Those lanterns moving through the river are actually the ferry , while those stars flashing in the distance are beams of light that come from the lighthouse every five seconds ."
4073,"It is only now that I realize that , even in the drabbest weather , Tanshui is still beautiful ."
4074,Taiwan 's Townships
4075,"When you look at a map , what do the 309 townships of Taiwan mean to you ?"
4076,Do you draw a complete blank on all of them ?
4077,Or do some of the names evoke beautiful memories ?
4078,What do these townships have to offer visitors ?
4079,What interesting or famous characters have they given birth to ?

4082,Tanshui Facts and Figures
4083,Tanshui Township -LRB- also spelled Tamsui -RRB- is part of Taipei County .
4084,"It abuts Sanchih Rural Township to the northeast , the Kuantu area of Taipei City to the southeast , and the Taiwan Strait to the northwest ; to the southwest it faces Pali Rural Township over the Tanshui River ."
4085,"It covers an area of just over 70 square kilometers , and has a population of 115,000 ."
4086,It is the largest paddy - rice producing area in Taipei County .
4087,"In days gone by , because the Kuroshio current passes close by , the waters offshore were rich fishing grounds ."
4088,"However , in recent years , pollution from the Tanshui River and exhaustion of fish stocks have caused the catch to dwindle ."
4089,"Among the more famous tourist sites are Fort San Domingo , Yin Shan Temple , the Lixuetang school -LRB- known in English as Oxford College , founded in 1882 to train missionaries -RRB- , Huwei cannon emplacement , the mangrove conservation area , Shalun beach recreation area , the historic buildings of the Mackay Hospital and Tamkang Middle School , "" Antiques Street "" -LRB- Chungcheng Road -RRB- , and the ferry pier ."

4102,The Remaking of Linpien
4103,Home of the Black Pearl Wax Apple
4104,-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / photos by Jimmy Lin / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
4105,"Even if the township of Linpien does n't have a monopoly on the cultivation of "" black pearl "" wax apples , it was orchards in the Linpien locality that earned black pearls their national renown ."
4106,"A little town formerly notorious for its ground subsidence problem , Linpien is now turning itself into one of Southern Taiwan 's premier tourist attractions ."
4107,"The impetus for this change has come chiefly from local historians , along with various voluntary groups ."
4108,"Just before Christmas break , the rural township of Linpien , on the Pingtung Plain at the mouth of the Linpien river , held its first ever Wax Apple Festival ."
4109,"The festival , in the town 's riverside park , was held to promote black pearl wax apples and celebrate the local volunteer spirit ."
4110,"It was a scorching hot day , and heavily perspiring visitors were to be seen wandering among the stalls , lugging bags of wax apples and commenting on their remarkable sweetness ."
4111,""" There 's a lot more than you 'd think to growing wax apples , "" says local farmer Chen Sheng - tzung ."
4112,""" How you take care of the orchards , which equipment you use - it all has an affect on the shape and texture of the fruit . """
4113,"Prices for wax apples range widely , from around 3 pounds for NT$ 100 to NT$ 150 a pound ."
4114,Fruit that shows a hint of black through the red color of the skin fetches the best price .
4115,"Huang Wan - fu , whose family farms two hectares of orchard with more than 700 wax apple trees , and who has over 30 years ' experience as a fruit grower , says that while other parts of Pingtung County also grow wax apples , "" Linpien stands out for its growing techniques , developed through trial and error by the growers themselves , and for vernalization rates of up to 90 % . """
4116,Ugly duckling no more
4117,The wax apple is a tropical fruit originating from the Malay peninsula .
4118,"The Dutch brought it to Taiwan from Java , in the 17th century , and it became commonly grown as a shade - giving tree ."
4119,"Old folk in the South remember when wax apples were "" just something to munch on "" - the kind of fruit that grew freely and that you could help yourself to ."
4120,"But wax apples have increased in value during the past 30 years , thanks to advances in the way that they are grown ."
4121,"For example , the "" bag - wrap "" method was originally a way of protecting budding fruit from birds , but once it was introduced to Linpien , in around 1994 , farmers found it enabled them to grow more lustrous , shiny - looking wax apples , with less pesticide on the skin ."
4122,The method soon caught on throughout the district .
4123,Another popular technique involves covering the trees with black mosquito nets to improve yields .
4124,"This reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the trees , causing nutrients from the leaves and branches to be diverted into producing fruit ."
4125,The net - covered trees blossom earlier and produce more fruit .
4126,"As a result of this technique , black pearl wax apples are now available throughout most of the year ."
4127,"The "" black pearl "" tag did n't originate in Linpien , but it was Linpien wax apples that made the variety famous and prompted the dramatic growth of its market ."
4128,"In 1983 the then - provincial governor Lee Teng - hui visited the town and praised the quality of its black pearl wax apples , so assuring the renown of the fruit ."
4129,"Subsequently , as president , Lee Teng - hui often gave gifts of black pearl wax apples to foreign dignitaries ."
4130,Green hills
4131,"The success of black pearl wax apples gave Linpien a much - needed boost , bringing some of the younger generation back to the area to grow the fruit ."
4132,The credit for putting wax apples at the heart of the town 's revival and for mounting the Wax Apple Festival belongs with a group of volunteer workers - local people committed to the town 's regeneration .
4133,"How does a small town like Linpien come to be home to such a well - organized volunteer effort , and just how did the volunteers set about giving their town a make - over ?"
4134,The story begins with the town 's riverside park .
4135,"The road linking the town 's main street with the riverside park , where locals like to stroll and chat at the beginning and end of the day , used to be overgrown and lined with trash ."
4136,"Now , however , thanks to a coordinated effort involving volunteers , residents and landlords , the verges are planted with sunflowers and lantana , while a former mud patch , donated rent - free by its owner , has been converted into a carp - filled lotus pool ."
4137,"The revamping of Linpien started eight or nine years ago , when schoolteacher Tsao Chi - hung - now a DPP deputy in the national legislature - along with fellow members of the Linpien Residents ' Democracy Association launched a program to sweep the streets and keep the riverbank clean ."
4138,"Wu Wu - ta , a plumber who runs the Democracy Association , says : "" People were already doing their bit for the community over ten years ago , but not openly ."
4139,"They swept the streets before dawn because they did n't want people to see them and call them crazy . """
4140,"It was only three years ago , with the founding of the non-political Linpien Natural History Conservation Association , that residents began to publicly support the project ."
4141,"The flood - prone Linpien River has been dyked and dredged since the Japanese colonial era , but the bare concrete embankments never did much for the scenery ."
4142,"In 1999 Tsao Chi - hung learned that the Water Conservancy Bureau was planning to renovate the flood defenses , and he proposed a scheme for "" greenification "" of the riverside area ."
4143,"Objections were raised , however , with some pointing out that the site , if left untended , could easily get overgrown and become a breeding ground for snakes and vermin ."
4144,The issue was discussed and finally the Bureau agreed to let volunteers maintain the riverside area for two years .
4145,If the scheme did n't work out then the Bureau would concrete over the site as originally planned .
4146,"Following the lead of the conservation association and the Democracy Association , various volunteer groups in the district - including the senior citizens ' club , members of Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation , the Presbyterian Church , and followers of the I - Kuan Tao sect - signed up to share responsibility for the riverside park , which was divided into 90 - meter - long plots for the purpose ."
4147,"Turf was laid , flower beds appeared , and the embankment soon became a 1.2 km - long "" green Great Wall . """

4151,"Chen frets about the way the media has focused the spotlight on him alone , when numerous other individuals are also involved , all chipping in what they can ."

4160,In the middle of the 17th century the Ming dynasty loyalist Zheng Chenggong -LRB- also known as Koxinga -RRB- brought an influx of settlers to Taiwan from the Fujian and Guangdong regions of China .

4162,"The oldest recorded use of the name "" Linpien "" is on a stele , erected in 1762 , next to the town 's Sanshan King Temple ."
4163,"The name , which means "" beside the forest , "" indicates that the early settlers must have had a tough time clearing land for their crops ."
4164,Moving to center - stage
4165,"In the past half century or more Linpien has concentrated on a series of different forms of produce , from rice , to bananas , to prawn and eel farming , to wax apples - today 's main crop ."

4172,"For Yang , the way that those most active in the renewal effort routinely pass the credit to others is itself impressive ."

4174,But can it now push its way to center - stage as a tourist attraction ?
4175,"Says Chen Chin - chao : "" We ca n't yet say how things will turn out for Linpien ."

4210,Tips for Getting through Middle Age
4211,-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
4212,Middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door .
4213,"Many people peacefully go through it , growing wiser and losing their rough edges ."
4214,A minority do n't know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap .
4215,"Middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one 's life , when one 's responsibilities are heaviest ."
4216,"As a result , the crises experienced by a minority of middle - aged people can involve a lot of other people , so their impact can not be overlooked ."
4217,"Middle age , those years between 40 and 60 , is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that 's easiest to overlook ."
4218,"In comparison to youth or old age , the middle years are often thought of as the time when power , ability , wealth , and physical strength are all at or near their peak , so that one has no excuse for feeling melancholy ."
4219,"Even if there are problems , it is commonly thought that one should be able to resolve them by oneself , notes Chiu Chia - li , director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center , who has worked on many middle - aged cases ."
4220,Social bias makes many of the middle aged afraid to discuss their problems .
4221,"This is particularly the case for men , who generally find it difficult to talk about their feelings ."
4222,"But by keeping everything inside , they may cause irreparable harm to their health ."
4223,"In recent years cancer , sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age , which shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked ."
4224,How do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years ?
4225,Here are a few suggestions :
4226,1. Live well at every stage of life
4227,"Li Liang - che , a professor of psychology at National Chengchi University , looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology ."
4228,"He points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood , to youth and middle age ."
4229,Smoothly passing through any period of life helps make getting through the next period easier .
4230,"In other words , the people most at risk during middle age are those who have had difficulties earlier in life ."
4231,Foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways to get out of trouble .
4232,Is it too late to start talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged ?
4233,"Chang Der - chung , an associate professor in the Department of Living Science at National Open University who worked at a counseling hotline for over a decade , argues that any step in the right direction is worthwhile , no matter when you start ."
4234,"Middle - aged problems are rather predictable , and they 're not hard to avoid ."
4235,Are you worried that your marriage is growing stale ?
4236,"Then no matter how busy you are , you 've got to set aside some time to be with your spouse ."
4237,Are you worried about losing your job ?
4238,Then start developing a second skill and get into the habit of saving and managing your money .
4239,Are you worried about how to care for your parents when they get old and sick ?
4240,"Then spend more time with them , and encourage them to get more exercise and take care of themselves ."
4241,There are so many things to be concerned about during middle age that you had better get an early start .
4242,"Otherwise , you 'll end up being overwhelmed ."
4243,2. Start over
4244,"In China it used to be said that middle age was the period when one was "" heir to the ancient sages and the teacher of posterity . """
4245,But now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving today 's problems .
4246,To assume a posture of superiority based on one 's seniority will make one despised .
4247,"Hence , it is necessary to cast aside one 's old self and start over ."
4248,"Chiu notes that many middle - aged who have worked diligently for years to attain management positions look down on the younger generation for being reckless and disorganized , but they do n't realize that creativity and energy may be ready to explode from underneath these flaws ."
4249,"Stuck in the past and full of bitterness , they may end up getting discarded onto the scrap heap of history ."
4250,"With each new era , role models change ."
4251,"Until the new role models have been established , it is important to maintain flexibility ."
4252,"For instance , today 's middle - aged Chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women 's liberation movement ."
4253,"They set high expectations for themselves , but their disappointments are likewise large ."
4254,Many women are torn between conflicting desires : to be good homemakers like their mothers and to have successful careers like their fathers .
4255,"Their candles are burning at both ends , because they are trying to live up to two old role models rather than establishing a new one for themselves ."
4256,Then there are men who insist upon being strict fathers and disciplinarians or staying at the same company until they retire .
4257,And there are women who are determined to play the role of the traditional Chinese wife and mother .
4258,"Ignoring the changing times , they place tremendous pressure on themselves ."
4259,3. Turn the focus from outside to inside
4260,"Life is a process that moves from the "" outward "" to the "" inward , "" says Alice Lu , director of the International Family Life Education Center , getting to the heart of the matter ."
4261,"Lu explains that as children people yearn for the affection of their parents ; as adolescents they want the affirmation of their peers ; and as adults , they set their sights on educational qualifications , finding a good job , making money , marrying a good spouse and so forth ."
4262,"Everyone puts the emphasis on outward manifestations of success , and this emphasis on the glitter of outward achievement continues up to middle age ."
4263,""" By middle age , people have gotten from the outside world just about all they can , "" says Lu ."
4264,""" What they have n't attained yet they probably wo n't attain ever , so it 's not worth getting all worked up about it ."
4265,"This is the time of life when the doubts set in . """
4266,"Many middle - aged people begin to ask themselves , "" Is this really what I want ?"
4267,"What has been the point of all my hard striving ? """
4268,"When the doubts come , some people continue trying to find answers from outside , thinking that everything would be fine if they could just change jobs or wives !"
4269,But then they rashly switch jobs or foolishly get involved in an affair only to find that they 've just made things worse .
4270,""" In middle age you start to listen to what 's going on inside , "" says Lu ."
4271,""" It 's the time of life when you start to hone your skills at conversing with your soul . """
4272,People ask themselves : Am I truly happy ?
4273,Do I like the person I see in the mirror ?
4274,Why ?
4275,What dreams can I pursue ?
4276,"At this point , there is no longer any need to try to measure oneself against outside standards ."
4277,Instead it 's more important to accept oneself and attempt to find an inner balance .
4278,""" One need not compare one 's inner achievements with those of other people , "" notes Chiu ."
4279,"Everyone 's circumstances and personalities are different , and they place different expectations on themselves ."
4280,"It 's not a matter of being better or worse than anyone else , and there 's no need to follow the currents of fashion ."
4281,Everyone is unique .
4282,Morris Chang was in his fifties when he became an entrepreneur and founded Taiwan Semiconductor .
4283,"Many others at the same time in life have opted to take early retirement and find a guru in India , work as a volunteer , or do whatever else they want to do ."
4284,"In the modern age when people value different things , you can find a purely personal kind of happiness and success ."
4285,4. Realistically strive for one 's dreams
4286,"When focusing inward , many dreams that have long been discarded will end up floating to the surface ."
4287,"At such times , one should remember to ask oneself three questions :"
4288,""" What do I want ? "" "" What can I do ? "" And "" What must I do and have ? """
4289,"Chang Der - chung reminds people to think clearly about their needs , and then think about the costs ."
4290,Will meeting these personal needs necessarily come into conflict with meeting one 's responsibilities ?
4291,Is there some way that the two can be accomplished simultaneously ?
4292,"When facing problems at work in Taiwan , many people decide to change careers or even to pursue their fortunes in mainland China or Southeast Asia ."
4293,"Pursuing some dream of really making it big , many men use up their savings , leaving their wives as the sole source of family support and suffering loneliness in a foreign land ."
4294,"There 's no right or wrong here , and there 's no way to guarantee a venture will be successful , but beforehand one must at least be realistic and prepare oneself psychologically for all possible outcomes , so that one wo n't suffer losses larger than one can bear ."
4295,""" It is indeed the case that when one is young , one 's quiver is full of arrows and opportunities abound , so that one can shoot at will , "" says Chang by way of analogy ."
4296,""" Once you get into middle age , you 've got to make every arrow count . """
4297,"Chang explains that everyone has dreams , and that continually working toward those dreams is an excellent method of relieving stress at any age ."
4298,"Middle - aged people have heavy burdens , and sometimes they may feel as if they are suffocating under them ."
4299,""" But accomplishing a lot of little changes can bring about a big change . """
4300,"If you make an effort to do what you can , you will immediately find that your burdens have been lightened ."
4301,"Chang cites this example : Say you hate being tied up by your work , and would like to go back to school ."
4302,Why do n't you try a weekend class ?
4303,Maybe that would help to alleviate your anxiety .
4304,"Or if you are a housewife , taking care of three generations and resentful that you ca n't go out and get the sense of accomplishment that comes with a full - time job , then maybe you could work as a volunteer in a community organization ."
4305,This would both put you into contact with other people and help you gain a sense of accomplishment .
4306,And you can help to sweat off your middle - aged anxieties by making a habit of regularly exercising .
4307,"What 's more , do n't worry too much about time being short ."
4308,Remember that most modern people live long lives that can be divided up into many stages .
4309,"In middle age , when you discover that your personal desires are coming into conflict with the demands of your family or society , decide which of your problems are the most urgent ."
4310,Do n't try to accomplish all of your dreams at once .
4311,Maintain an unhurried frame of mind and peacefully wait for opportunities to present themselves .
4312,5. Change your perspective
4313,"In middle age , one 's life is already half over , and one has already amply tasted of life 's fruits , both the bitter and the sweet ."
4314,""" I am thankful for the bad times , for they have given me more insight into life and a better opportunity to understand myself , "" says Lin Hung - kuei , an I - kuan Tao devotee , who has studied the Book of Changes and fengshui ."
4315,"Taking care of your parents , losing your job , illness and even being cheated out of money can be embraced as opportunities to experience life ."
4316,They are lessons that the middle - aged learn from to become more proficient at the art of living .
4317,""" By changing perspective , you can understand the insignificance of your problems , "" points out Chiu Chia - li ."
4318,It is very important to adjust your frame of mind .
4319,You should n't think that there is only one way that you can be .
4320,"As long as you can accept yourself , then everything is all right ."
4321,"As for losing your job in middle age , some people make NT$ 100,000 and it 's not enough ."
4322,"Other's find that NT$ 20,000 is more than enough to support the family ."
4323,"The problem is that by insisting on making NT$ 100,000 a month , you may pass by a suitable job that pays NT$ 20,000 ."
4324,"Chang also notes that when people come to forks in the road when they reach middle age , they may look around in all directions and feel at a loss , but they 've got to encourage themselves to keep pressing ahead ."
4325,""" Even if you feel uncertain , it should be a positive feeling of uncertainty . """
4326,"At the very least , you 've got to work hard at establishing a sense of direction ."
4327,"When Li Liang - che starts feeling sorry for himself , he uses the age - old method of considering those who are even worse off ."
4328,"Those people who are always complaining about their lot in life should take a walk around a cancer ward , "" Li says ."
4329,"Then they 'll realize how lucky they are . """
4330,"Chiu Chia - li , on the other hand , encourages the middle - aged not to close themselves off ."
4331,"They must get out and make friends , so as to get things off their chests and find support from each other ."
4332,This makes it easier to get through the bad times .
4333,"Finally , there is something that may seem a little cliched but is often very useful - namely the realization that things will get better , that tomorrow is another day ."
4334,""" Whether you are depressed or going berserk , it 's important to remember that hormones are raging inside the bodies of the middle - aged , "" says Chang ."
4335,"Much like rebellious adolescents , they may merely need to pass through into another stage for the sky to become blue again ."
4336,"Do n't give up hope too early , and do n't be afraid of asking for assistance ."
4337,"When you feel at a loss emotionally , the experts will be able to help ."
4338,p. 18
4339,The shackles of midlife make middle - aged steps heavy .
4340,"How can one escape from one 's commitments to snatch half a day of freedom , and appreciate the world from a new perspective ?"
4341,p. 20

4343,The middle - aged have dreams .
4344,"If built on a solid foundation , they can make life more enjoyable and fulfilling ."
4345,p. 22
4346,Is life getting you down ?
4347,"Go into the crowd , find things to do , and you will rediscover a sense of the value of life ."
4348,"While residents of the richest province in Bolivia , Santa Cruz , were fervently celebrating the victory of a referendum on autonomy , President Morales warned that the referendum was "" illegal and unconstitutional "" ."
4349,"In a speech broadcast to the nation , Morales said , "" The election is illegal and unconstitutional . It is not as successful as some families wished . """
4350,"He claimed that the election was a "" complete failure "" , and stressed that the high rates of voter abstention and opposing votes has already made this referendum not legal ."
4351,"He said , "" Unfortunately , the referendum has already split up the province of Santa Cruz . """
4352,Many people are worried about widespread instances of violence in Santa Cruz after the referendum .
4353,"During the referendum , numerous conflicts have occurred between supporters and militants opposed to autonomy , injuring at least 20 people ."
4354,Military leaders of Bolivia said that they take this action of fighting for autonomy as a threat to the country 's territorial integrity .
4355,"Next month , three other provinces in the lower eastern region that are held by the opposition party will hold referenda on autonomy . By that time , this crisis will deepen ."
4356,Two other provinces are also considering following suit ; there are a total of nine provinces in Bolivia .
4357,"Since realistic toy weapons could be mixed up with real ones , confuse the police 's attention , and threaten social safety , 15 U. S. states attempted to enhance impacts on imitation weapons on top of the current gun control bills ."
4358,"The United States "" Ming Pao Daily News "" reported on the 4th that according to a statistics of National Conference on State Legislature , there are seven proposed bills on restrictions of imitation firearms being discussed in 15 of the U. S. states ; there have been 21 such bills passed and implemented since 1990 ."
4359,"These bills concern the prohibition of placing imitation firearms in cars , or prohibiting sales of toy guns in convenience stores ."
4360,"Tennessee state lawmakers are considering a proposal by state representative , DeBerry ."
4361,"The proposal will make it a misdemeanor to "" intentionally display or expose an imitation firearm in a public place in a threatening manner . """
4362,"However , exceptions include justifiable self defense , lawful hunting , and displays such as a museum collection ."
4363,"DeBerry said that this proposal would help to prevent a tragedy that occurred in West Memphis last year , when a 12 - year - old boy holding a toy gun was killed by the police ."
4364,"A few days ago , the People 's Olympic Forum with the theme "" 2008 Beijing Olympics : Humanistic Ideals and Harmonious World "" was jointly held by the China Democratic League Central Committee and the China Democratic League Beijing Municipal Committee to act in the ideal of humanistic Olympics and give full play to the power of all circles in society ."

4367,He proposed the vast numbers of league members in Beijing to lead by example and be the first to set an example around the humanistic Olympics ideal and be good champions and practitioners in heightening public civilization in the capital .
4368,"Experts attending the forum made excellent speeches in respective areas including "" humanistic Olympics "" , "" safe Olympics "" , "" cultural harmony "" and "" urban public civilization "" ."
4369,"Huang Yaling , Director of Beijing Sport University Center for Olympic Studies , advocated people to show more concern about Olympic safety and not to neglect safety issues in food , transportation , and venues ."

4381,"First , the endless junk text messages , and then the torture of the "" one - ring calls "" at all hours of the day and night ."
4382,"The most annoying is that up until now , besides the positions made known by relevant government departments , there is still no concrete action to resolve the problem ."
4383,"It seems that since consumers have chosen to use mobile phones , they should endure this unexpected torture ."
4384,"The continuous concern by the media has helped people to heighten their awareness against "" one - ring calls "" ."
4385,"It is no longer easy to use "" one - ring calls "" to defraud mobile phone user fees ."
4386,"However , it does not mean that people can tolerate the existence of "" one - ring calls "" and that they can give up the close questioning of the responsibilities of relevant government departments and telecommunication operators ."
4387,"The first response of many mobile phone users when they hear the "" one - ring call "" is : "" Why does n't anyone attend to this ? """
4388,"A survey conducted by websites including Sina and Tencent with close to 200,000 netizens showed that over 70 percent of people frequently encounter "" one - ring calls "" and 68.5 percent of people believed that telecommunication operators take part in the profit - sharing of "" one - ring calls "" ."

4409,"Secondly , if there was any Syrian citizen that might have been involved in this crime , then he would be a criminal and punished in the same way as any criminal appearing before the impartial Syrian courts "" ."
4410,"He clarified that the United Nations had resorted to setting up international courts in other parts of the world such as Sierra Leone and the former Yugoslavia because "" the courts there had collapsed but our courts are independent and fair and so we will not agree to any Syrian citizen being brought before an international court because we have confidence in our courts "" ."
4411,"President Bush is now drowning in a sea of recommendations . . whose goal is to lift him out of the Iraqi quagmire that has been drowning him for 44 months : 79 recommendations from the Baker - Hamilton Commission alone , recommendations from the Pentagon , from State Department , from the National Security Council , from Congress , and a memorandum that he received very late from his former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld . . All of them pushing for change , and all of them involving an implicit admission of military and political failure . ."
4412,"As a whole , and because of their great number , variety , overlap , and sometimes contradictions , they may cause him more confusion and distraction , and hinder his ability to choose the most realistic approach ."
4413,He now appears open to the idea of change .
4414,But to what extent is he ready for radical change ? And in which direction ?
4415,And who ultimately will decide the most appropriate approach ?
4416,"Is it he or his new Defense Secretary , or the military leadership , or the Congress with its Democratic majority ?"
4417,"Bush has previously excluded some of the fundamental suggestions of the Baker Commission , including holding direct talks with Iran and Syria , linking the Iraqi War with the Palestinian issue , and setting a timetable for a withdrawal , as well as penalizing the Iraqi government if it fails to impose security ."
4418,"And if the evaluation and assessment were to be left to him , he may not find in this report magical solutions for his Iraqi crisis , nor recommendations that convince him of a need for radical change in his Iraqi policy ."
4419,"He had a previous position vis - a - vis the report as a whole , and he decided that it will not be a binding working paper ."
4420,It appears that he has a particular sensitivity towards it after it was said that the team of Bush Senior had come to rescue the Prodigal Son .
4421,"In any case , the report is a very long road map to deal with the issues of the Middle East , and is not a quick solution to stopping the violence and anarchy in Iraq ."
4422,The Arab Water Council is currently looking into the provision of financial funding in order to update studies relating to the financial situation in Arab countries and to prepare regular reports on the Arab water situation and the recommendations needed to face future crises linked to water security .
4423,"Cairo was host to the 3rd Regional Arab Water Conference last week , attended by irrigation ministers , the Egyptian Mahmoud Abu Zaid , the Iraqi Abdul Latif Rasheed , the Moroccan Abdulkarim Zahoud and the Sudanese Joseph Joakok , as well as 350 experts from 22 Arab and foreign countries , in the course of which they warned of Arab countries ' increasing reliance on imported food ."
4424,Abu Zaid asserted that the time has come to rely on non-governmental organizations and civil society associations to provide suitable conditions to face the challenge of water scarcity and pointed out that one of the priorities of the work of the Arab Water Council is to set up a program funded by eminent Arab sponsors .
4425,"Abu Zaid said that the scarcity of water in the region dates back 50 years and continues to increase at a rate in line with the population increase , alongside threats to water resources from rivers shared with neighboring countries and a worsening economic situation in several Arab countries which impedes steps towards development ."
4426,He said that the difficult equation in the region is that of achieving food security since food production uses up around 80 % of Arab water resources .
4427,"This means that there has to be cooperation in order to make use of the excess in some countries , alongside increased Arab investments in the field mentioned and the creation of cooperation strategies ."
4428,"The head of the National Center for Water Research in Egypt , Shadin Abduljawad , presented a report to the conference which said that 65 % of our water resources originate from outside the borders of Arab countries and that the percentage of water desalination in the arid Arab region is close to 70 % ."
4429,"Former American President Jimmy Carter is braving a savage Israeli campaign in the United States and the rest of the Western countries because he dared to speak out and break the barrier of silence , by comparing the Hebrew state to the white racist regime of South Africa and exposing the violations by its governments of the rights of the Palestinians ."
4430,"President Carter faced a series of accusations beginning with anti-Semitism and ending with spreading lies , while he is the man who won the Nobel Peace Prize , and achieved for Israel the greatest strategic accomplishment in its short history , which is the signing of the Camp David Accords that split Arab ranks and got Egypt out of the confrontation , and established the first diplomatic relations between Israel and the largest Arab State ."
4431,"President Carter 's book , which is on the best - seller book list , came as a shock to the Jewish lobby and a breach of its domination in the American media and political institutions , at a time when the whole world is paying an exorbitant price for the wars of the neo-conservatives , Israel 's supporters , in Iraq , Afghanistan , and soon in Iran ."
4432,"And perhaps some might argue that President Carter did not speak as forcefully and dare to confront the Jewish lobby until after he left power , and is nearing the last stages of his senior age , which is true ."
4433,"But the man did not last in power more than one term -LRB- four years -RRB- , and when he began to understand the truth of the conflict in the region , he lost the presidential elections ."
4434,"President Carter sided with his conscience as a human being , and he decided to speak his mind strongly and sharply against a racist state which hijacked , through its supporters , the White House and the decision - making circle in it , and exploited it to serve its interests and its wars , and to cover for its crimes against the Palestinian people and the entire Arab nation ."
4435,"Australian Prime Minister John Howard mentioned today , Friday , that he had no plans to send additional forces to Iraq , nor to reduce the number of troops in the war - torn Gulf country ."
4436,Howard 's announcements came after speculation that the United States was planning to increase the number of troops in Iraq .
4437,"Howard told the Nine Network , "" I do not have any plans at present to increase the number of Australian troops , nor do I have any plans to reduce them . """
4438,"Howard said that he would be notified if the US President decided to send more troops , but that did not mean that Australia would do the same ."
4439,"He added that "" The situation at the next elections will depend on the situation in Iraq ; the thing we wo n't do is to be part of any withdrawal , as it grants victory to the terrorists "" ."
4440,"Howard admitted that Australia depends on the United States , and asserted the necessity to continue this alliance ."
4441,"Australia , a strong supporter of the war on terror led by the United States , has 1,400 soldiers deployed inside and outside Iraq ."
4442,There are speculations that the United States has asked Australia to send more troops to Iraq .

4445,He expected the unemployment situation to continue to improve since the internal demand in Hong Kong remains very strong on the eve of the lunar new year .
4446,"After attending the launching ceremony of "" Youth Employment Home Base "" by the labor department yesterday , Cheung Kin - chung said that from August to October this year , 34,000 college graduates and departed students successfully found jobs , an increase of 3,100 people compared with the same period last year ."

4450,"The Russian police have said that Litvinenko , the defected Russian spy who was fatally poisoned , could have died because of a high level of business competition ."
4451,"But based on information in the hands of British police and Litvinenko 's final denunciation before his death , the focus of the investigation has locked onto the possibility that it was a political assassination involving the Russian security agency ."
4452,"Russian police revealed that while he was alive , after he fled to England , Litvinenko was taken on by Erinys , a British company , where he was responsible for employee training ."
4453,The international company is in charge of security for the petroleum industry and has more than ten thousand employees .
4454,Russian police claim that Erinys has an important competitor RISC .
4455,"The last people Litvinenko saw while he was alive , Lugovoi and his friends , were all engaged in these industries ."
4456,Lugovoi is also a client of RISC .
4457,An analysis by Russian police states that Litvinenko died because of business competition .
4458,"Besides an investigation being carried out by British police in Russia , international criminal police organizations have already become involved ."

4460,It 's not even certain if we can take a bus now .
4461,"Public transportation enterprises say that there needs to be a two - thirds increase in the number of buses if they are not going to be "" overloaded "" ."
4462,One can well imagine how many people will be refused entry to buses when overloading them is really prohibited .
4463,I do n't know how those ordinary people can get around then ?
4464,By private car or taxi ?
4465,"They are clearly unable to afford either , so the only choice left for them is to choose to walk or ride a bike ."
4466,But the city of Guangzhou is so big that getting around on foot or by bike will be an extremely torturous affair .
4467,Every citizen has his own right of the road .
4468,Citizens all have the right to independently choose when and how to use the road .
4469,"In the aim of achieving harmony and order in city traffic , ordinary people have already relinquished a fairly large part of their right to the road by allowing wider roads for the owners of private cars ."
4470,"Morally speaking , the government and the rich should actually feel greatly indebted to them ."
4471,But the truth is different .
4472,The elite have greatly deceived the people and with insatiable avariciousness have deprived ordinary people of the pathetic little remaining right to the road with which they have been left .
4473,"It seems that in their eyes , biking or walking is the obvious choice of ordinary people ."
4474,"As an ordinary person who can not afford a private car , living in Guangzhou is simply too depressing ."
4475,"But other than a few curses , what else can we do ?"

4487,"The intelligence unit of The Economist of Britain has predicted that in 2007 , U.S. economic growth will slow down significantly , and the growth rate will be a mere 2 % ."
4488,This is largely caused by the profound changes that have occurred in America 's housing markets .
4489,"After years of wild increases , the housing prices and trading volumes of real estate in the U.S. are both declining ."
4490,The booming housing market was one of the main impetuses for the development of the U.S. economy to reach its climax from 2004 to 2006 .

4523,Ports of Call Inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed .
4524,The agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring .
4525,The company said a portion of the $ 32 million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended air - charter operations .
4526,Earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of Boeing Co. 707s because of increasing maintenance costs .
4527,A consortium of private investors operating as LJH Funding Co. said it has made a $ 409 million cash bid for most of L.J. Hooker Corp. 's real - estate and shopping - center holdings .
4528,"The $ 409 million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ 300 million in secured liabilities on those properties , according to those making the bid ."
4529,"The group is led by Jay Shidler , chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corp. in Honolulu , and A. Boyd Simpson , chief executive of the Atlanta - based Simpson Organization Inc ."
4530,Mr. Shidler 's company specializes in commercial real - estate investment and claims to have $ 1 billion in assets ; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L.J. Hooker .
4531,"`` The assets are good , but they require more money and management '' than can be provided in L.J. Hooker 's current situation , said Mr. Simpson in an interview . ``"
4532,Hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell .
4533,We want to build and hold . ''
4534,"L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ."
4535,"Its parent company , Hooker Corp. of Sydney , Australia , is currently being managed by a court - appointed provisional liquidator ."
4536,"Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker , said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee ."
4537,The $ 409 million bid is estimated by Mr. Simpson as representing 75 % of the value of all Hooker real - estate holdings in the U.S. .
4538,"Not included in the bid are Bonwit Teller or B. Altman & Co. , L.J. Hooker 's department - store chains ."
4539,"The offer covers the massive 1.8 million - square - foot Forest Fair Mall in Cincinnati , the 800,000 square - foot Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia , S.C. , and the 700,000 square - foot Thornton Town Center mall in Thornton , Colo ."
4540,The Thornton mall opened Sept. 19 with a Bigg 's hypermarket as its anchor ; the Columbia mall is expected to open Nov. 15 .
4541,"Other Hooker properties included are a 20 - story office tower in midtown Atlanta , expected to be completed next February ; vacant land sites in Florida and Ohio ; L.J. Hooker International , the commercial real - estate brokerage company that once did business as Merrill Lynch Commercial Real Estate , plus other shopping centers ."
4542,"The consortium was put together by Hoare Govett , the London - based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of Security Pacific Corp ."
4543,"`` We do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid , '' said Allan Campbell , the head of mergers and acquisitions at Hoare Govett , in an interview ."
4544,Hoare Govett is acting as the consortium 's investment bankers .
4545,"According to people familiar with the consortium , the bid was code - named Project Klute , a reference to the film `` Klute '' in which a prostitute played by actress Jane Fonda is saved from a psychotic businessman by a police officer named John Klute ."
4546,L.J. Hooker was a small home - building company based in Atlanta in 1979 when Mr. Simpson was hired to push it into commercial development .
4547,"The company grew modestly until 1986 , when a majority position in Hooker Corp. was acquired by Australian developer George Herscu , currently Hooker 's chairman ."
4548,"Mr. Herscu proceeded to launch an ambitious , but ill - fated , $ 1 billion acquisition binge that included Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. , as well as majority positions in Merksamer Jewelers , a Sacramento chain ; Sakowitz Inc. , the Houston - based retailer , and Parisian Inc. , the Southeast department - store chain ."
4549,"Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company , and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in 1988 ."
4550,"Since then , Hooker Corp. has sold its interest in the Parisian chain back to Parisian 's management and is currently attempting to sell the B. Altman & Co. chain ."
4551,"In addition , Robert Sakowitz , chief executive of the Sakowitz chain , is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company ."
4552,The Merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by First Boston Corp .
4553,"Reached in Honolulu , Mr. Shidler said that he believes the various Hooker malls can become profitable with new management ."

4563,"As small investors peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend , big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals : cash ."
4564,"Unlike the weekend before Black Monday , the funds were n't swamped with heavy withdrawal requests ."
4565,And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week .
4566,"At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987 ."
4567,The Boston firm said stock - fund redemptions were running at less than one - third the level two years ago .
4568,"As of yesterday afternoon , the redemptions represented less than 15 % of the total cash position of about $ 2 billion of Fidelity 's stock funds ."
4569,"`` Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around , '' said C. Bruce Johnstone , who runs Fidelity Investments ' $ 5 billion Equity - Income Fund ."
4570,`` This feels more like a one - shot deal .
4571,People are n't panicking . ''
4572,The test may come today .
4573,Friday 's stock market sell - off came too late for many investors to act .
4574,Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices .
4575,Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle did n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday .
4576,But fund managers say they 're ready .
4577,"Many have raised cash levels , which act as a buffer against steep market declines ."
4578,"Mario Gabelli , for instance , holds cash positions well above 20 % in several of his funds ."
4579,"Windsor Fund 's John Neff and Mutual Series ' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20 % and 30 % , respectively , this year ."
4580,"Even Peter Lynch , manager of Fidelity 's $ 12.7 billion Magellan Fund , the nation 's largest stock fund , built up cash to 7 % or $ 850 million ."
4581,"One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions , the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September ."
4582,"`` I 've let the money build up , '' Mr. Lynch said , who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes ."
4583,"Not all funds have raised cash levels , of course ."
4584,"As a group , stock funds held 10.2 % of assets in cash as of August , the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute ."
4585,That was modestly higher than the 8.8 % and 9.2 % levels in August and September of 1987 .
4586,"Also , persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash ."
4587,"But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said ."
4588,A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday .
4589,"Stock - fund sales have rebounded in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels ."
4590,"`` There 's not nearly as much froth , '' said John Bogle , chairman of Vanguard Group Inc. , a big Valley Forge , Pa. , fund company ."
4591,Many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy .
4592,"Vincent Bajakian , manager of the $ 1.8 billion Wellington Fund , added to his positions in Bristol - Myers Squibb , Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday ."
4593,"And today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly , Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines ."
4594,"Fidelity 's Mr. Lynch , for his part , snapped up Southern Co. shares Friday after the stock got hammered ."
4595,"If the market drops further today , he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol - Myers and Kellogg ."
4596,"`` If they croak stocks like that , '' he said , it presents an opportunity that is `` the kind of thing you dream about . ''"
4597,Major mutual - fund groups said phone calls were arriving at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday .
4598,But most investors were seeking share prices and other information .
4599,Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal .
4600,"Still , fund groups are n't taking any chances ."
4601,They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund investors in October 1987 .
4602,Fidelity on Saturday opened its 54 walk - in investor centers across the country .
4603,The centers normally are closed through the weekend .
4604,"In addition , East Coast centers will open at 7:30 EDT this morning , instead of the normal 8:30 ."
4605,T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests .
4606,The Baltimore - based group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money - market funds .
4607,"But most investors seemed to be `` in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice president ."
4608,"And Vanguard , among other groups , said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through ."
4609,"In an unusual move , several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll - free phone lines ."
4610,"`` We view -LCB- Friday 's -RCB- market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long - term investors , '' a recording at Gabelli & Co. funds said over the weekend ."
4611,The Janus Group had a similar recording for investors .
4612,Several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize .
4613,Some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits .
4614,"Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25 % through September , according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc ."
4615,"Elaine Garzarelli , who runs Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's $ 335 million Sector Analysis Portfolio , predicts the market will open down at least 50 points on technical factors and `` some panic selling . ''"
4616,But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than 10 % to 15 % from recent highs .
4617,"`` This is not a major crash , '' she said ."
4618,"Nevertheless , Ms. Garzarelli said she was swamped with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders ."
4619,"`` Half of them are really scared and want to sell , '' she said , `` but I 'm trying to talk them out of it . ''"
4620,"She added , `` If they all were bullish , I 'd really be upset . ''"
4621,"The backdrop to Friday 's slide was markedly different from that of the October 1987 crash , fund managers argue ."
4622,"Two years ago , unlike today , the dollar was weak , interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued , they say ."
4623,"`` From the investors ' standpoint , institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson ... by selling at the lows '' on Black Monday , said Stephen Boesel , manager of the $ 580 million T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund ."

4625,"Atco Ltd. said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants , some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 851 million -RRB- , in Great Britain and elsewhere ."
4626,"C.S. Richardson , Atco 's senior vice president , finance , said its 50.1 % - owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada , and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere , including Britain , where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private - sector suppliers as part of its privatization program ."
4627,`` The projects are big .
4628,"They can be C$ 1 billion plus , '' Mr. Richardson said ."
4629,"`` But we would n't go into them alone , '' and Canadian Utilities ' equity stake would be small , he said ."
4630,"`` Ideally , we 'd like to be the operator -LCB- of the project -RCB- and a modest equity investor ."
4631,"Our long suit is our proven ability to operate '' power plants , he said ."
4632,"Mr. Richardson would n't offer specifics regarding Atco 's proposed British project , but he said it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to privatize its massive water and electric utilities ."
4633,"Britain 's government plans to raise about # 20 billion -LRB- $ 31.05 billion -RRB- from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities , beginning next month ."
4634,"The planned electric utility sale , scheduled for next year , is alone expected to raise # 13 billion , making it the world 's largest public offering ."
4635,"Under terms of the plan , independent generators would be able to compete for 15 % of customers until 1994 , and for another 10 % between 1994 and 1998 ."
4636,"Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$ 1.16 billion , mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta , where the company serves about 800,000 customers ."
4637,"`` There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , '' Mr. Richardson said , and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it ."
4638,"`` This is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries , though he would be specific ."
4639,"Canadian Utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain , in anticipation of the privatization program ."
4640,"`` We 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England , '' said Bruce Stram , vice president , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with Enron Corp. , Houston , a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator ."
4641,Mr. Stram said Enron is considering building gas - fired power plants in the U.K. capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $ 300 million to $ 400 million .

4645,"The well flowed at a rate of 2.016 million cubic feet of gas a day through a 16 64 - inch opening at depths between 5,782 and 5,824 feet ."
4646,"Diamond Shamrock is the operator , with a 100 % interest in the well ."

4648,Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. said it formed a $ 53.4 million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in California suitable for residential development .
4649,"The partnership , Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership , is a 50 - 50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp. , a unit of Heitman Financial Corp. , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills , Calif ."
4650,"Kaufman & Broad , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors ."
4651,"The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals ."
4652,"The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad ."
4653,`` There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash .
4654,"Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind ."
4655,`` We usually operate in that conservative manner . ''
4656,"By setting up the joint venture , Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , Mr. Karatz said ."
4657,"The company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture ."
4658,"`` This is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company , '' Mr. Karatz said ."
4659,"RJR Nabisco Inc. is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time , just a month after moving 11 of the group 's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta ."
4660,"A spokesman for the New York - based food and tobacco giant , taken private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion leveraged buy - out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit , and dismissing its 14 employees , in a move to save money ."
4661,"The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network - buying plans with its two main advertising firms , FCB / Leber Katz and McCann Erickson ."
4662,"`` We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost , '' said the spokesman , who declined to specify how much RJR spends on network television time ."
4663,"An executive close to the company said RJR is spending about $ 140 million on network television time this year , down from roughly $ 200 million last year ."
4664,"The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1 , and the move wo n't affect RJR 's print , radio and spot - television buying practices ."
4665,"The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago , when RJR 's previous management moved it to Atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer ."
4666,One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future . ''
4667,"He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies ."
4668,The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' upcoming season .
4669,"`` The studies -LCB- on closing the unit -RCB- could n't be completed until now , '' he said ."
4670,"The group 's president , Peter Chrisanthopoulos , was n't in his office Friday afternoon to comment ."
4671,"The U.S. , which is finalizing its steel - import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries ."
4672,"Meanwhile , the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community ."
4673,"Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five - year steel quotas , which expired Sept. 30 ."
4674,"Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990 ."
4675,"In recent years , U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation ."
4676,"Of the remaining 20 % needed , the steel - quota negotiations allocate about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which is n't included in the quota program ."
4677,"Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel ."
4678,Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas .
4679,"The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until March 31 , 1992 ."
4680,"It also said it would use that two - and - a - half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments ."
4681,"The U.S. termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension ."
4682,"Mexico , which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S. , virtually doubled its quota to 0.95 % of the U.S. steel market from 0.48 % under the previous quotas ."
4683,"South Korea , which had 1.9 % under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 % ."
4684,That increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the U.S. market if a joint Korean - U.S. steel project is included .
4685,"Meanwhile , Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43 % share it has had in recent years ."
4686,The EC and Japan -- the U.S. 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent .
4687,"The EC steel industry , which has been coping with strong European demand , has been supplying about 5 % of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 % ."
4688,Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5 % of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9 % .
4689,"In the recent talks , the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons , to 7 % of the U.S. market from 6.7 % in 1988 ."
4690,But its quota has been as high as 6.9 % in 1984 .
4691,"Japan , however , has agreed to cut its quota to about 5 % from 5.9 % previously ."
4692,"Japan , the EC , Brazil , Mexico and South Korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program ."
4693,"The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela ."
4694,The U.S. had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks .
4695,That was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting Japan 's allowance .
4696,Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1 % of the U.S. steel market to allocate .
4697,These optional 1 % - a - year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration 's steel - quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries .
4698,"Britain 's retail price index rose 0.7 % in September from August and was up 7.6 % for the year , the Central Statistical Office said ."
4699,Quest Medical Inc. said it adopted a shareholders ' rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of Oct. 23 .
4700,"The company said the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for Quest , a maker and marketer of hospital products ."
4701,The rights allow shareholders to purchase Quest stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than 15 % of the company 's common stock or announces a tender offer .
4702,Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room .
4703,Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload .
4704,The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds .
4705,"It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as Kao Corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S. ."
4706,"The Cincinnati consumer - products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets ."
4707,"`` They do n't want to get caught again , '' says one industry watcher ."
4708,"Retailers in Phoenix , Ariz. , say P&G 's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November ."
4709,A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month .
4710,She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others .
4711,Superconcentrates are n't entirely new for P&G .
4712,The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack .
4713,"When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % ."
4714,"With the help of Lemon Cheer , P&G 's share is now estimated to be 12 % ."
4715,"While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders ."
4716,"The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best - selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach ."
4717,"With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry ."
4718,"In the early 1980s , P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe ."
4719,"But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped ."
4720,"P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience ."
4721,But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading .
4722,"And retailers are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space ."
4723,"`` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' says Hugh Zurkuhlen , an analyst at Salomon Bros ."
4724,"But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case ."
4725,"If the new Cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates ."
4726,"Then retailers `` will probably push the -LCB- less - established -RCB- brands out altogether , '' he says ."
4727,Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. .
4728,"To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G , which has about 23 % of the market ."
4729,"Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co. , a Cincinnati hand - lotion maker ."
4730,It also has a product - testing facility in California .
4731,Some believe P&G 's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese .
4732,"`` This is something P&G would do with or without Kao , '' says Mr. Zurkuhlen ."
4733,"With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening , many Japanese had feared last week 's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills ."
4734,They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. .
4735,"Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long - term view ."
4736,Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher .
4737,Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade .
4738,He said such results should be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan .
4739,"But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . ''"
4740,She added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest . ''
4741,How such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months .
4742,American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills .
4743,Many called it simply a contrast in styles .
4744,But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic .
4745,Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand .
4746,And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade .
4747,"Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's , Mrs. Hills replied : `` I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration . ''"
4748,Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly `` conciliatory . ''
4749,"`` I think my line has been very consistent , '' Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon ."
4750,"`` I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement ."
4751,I do n't feel very ferocious .
4752,I do n't feel either hard or soft .
4753,I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . ''
4754,"When she met the local press for the first time on Friday , Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill ."
4755,She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified .
4756,But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world - wide free trade and open competition .
4757,She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets .
4758,"At her news conference for Japanese reporters , one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief ."
4759,"`` My impression was that you would be a scary old lady , '' he said , drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues ."
4760,`` But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity . ''
4761,"Mrs. Hills ' remarks did raise questions , at least among some U.S. officials , about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market ."
4762,The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years .
4763,"Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise ."
4764,"At one of her news conferences , Mrs. Hills said , `` I believe we can do much better than 20 % . ''"
4765,"But she stressed , `` I am against managed trade ."
4766,I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market .
4767,"Information International Inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized newspaper - publishing system , alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system ."
4768,A spokesman for Information International said the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system 's about $ 3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure to pay royalties .
4769,"Information International said it believes that the complaints , filed in federal court in Georgia , are without merit ."
4770,"Closely held Morris Communications is based in Augusta , Ga ."
4771,The units that filed the suit are Southeastern Newspapers Corp. and Florida Publishing Co .
4772,"Syms Corp. completed the sale of its A. Sulka & Co. subsidiary , a men 's luxury haberdashery , to Luxco Investments ."
4773,Terms were n't disclosed .
4774,"As Syms 's `` core business of off - price retailing grows , a small subsidiary that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction , '' said Marcy Syms , president of the parent , in a statement ."
4775,A spokeswoman said Sulka operates a total of seven stores in the U.S. and overseas .
4776,Syms operates 25 off - price apparel stores in the U.S. .
4777,The oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year .
4778,"Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability ."
4779,"The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year - earlier performance ."
4780,"The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview ."
4781,"`` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added ."
4782,He did n't forecast Phillips 's results .
4783,But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard - hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third - quarter earnings .
4784,"So , too , many analysts predict , will Exxon Corp. , Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp ."
4785,"Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene , a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies ."
4786,It has plunged 13 % since July to around 26 cents a pound .
4787,"A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents , peaking at about 34 cents last December ."
4788,A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion .
4789,"Beginning in mid-1987 , prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand ."
4790,Companies added capacity furiously .
4791,"Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower ."
4792,Third - quarter profits from gasoline were weaker .
4793,"`` Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year , '' said William Randol , a securities analyst at First Boston Corp ."
4794,Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't materialize .
4795,The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period .
4796,"In addition , crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier , further pressuring profitability ."
4797,"Refiners say margins picked up in September , and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter ."
4798,"During the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits ."
4799,Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year .
4800,Prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations .
4801,"Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter ."
4802,"`` We could see higher oil prices this year , '' said Bryan Jacoboski , an analyst at PaineWebber Inc ."
4803,"That will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a barrel in the fourth quarter ."
4804,"While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse ."
4805,"In the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988 ."
4806,The main reason remains weather .
4807,Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use .
4808,"This summer , on the other hand , had milder weather than usual ."
4809,"`` We 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , '' said Mr. Cox , Phillips 's president ."
4810,`` The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected . ''
4811,"Going into the fourth quarter , natural gas prices are anywhere from 8 % to 17 % lower than a year earlier ."
4812,"For instance , natural gas currently produced along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around $ 1.47 a thousand cubic feet , down 13 % from $ 1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago ."
4813,"The Bush administration , trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc , is questioning whether Italy 's Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. supplied militarily valuable technology to the Soviets ."
4814,"Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls , the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export - control policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 ."
4815,"They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high - technology products ."
4816,But the Bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export - control procedures before it will support further liberalization .
4817,"To make its point , it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer - driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft ."
4818,"The London Sunday Times , which first reported the U.S. concerns , cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $ 25 million in `` embargoed , state - of - the - art , flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry . ''"
4819,Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984 .
4820,"A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom , but declined to confirm any details ."
4821,Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules .
4822,President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader 's visit here last week .
4823,"Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules , asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities ."
4824,"Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export - control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community ."
4825,"`` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting , '' said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies ."
4826,"The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export - control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies ."
4827,"Last summer , Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods ."
4828,"But more recently , the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc ."
4829,"However , these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization ."
4830,"`` There 's no evidence that the Soviet program to -LRB- illegally -RRB- acquire Western technology has diminished , '' said a State Department spokesman ."
4831,"Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , charging they defrauded the thrift by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy $ 284 million in high - yield , high - risk junk bonds ."
4832,"In a suit filed in federal court Thursday , the S&L alleged that a `` disproportionate number '' of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value ."
4833,"Financial Corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million ."
4834,"Vagabond Hotels was controlled by Mr. Boesky , who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations ."
4835,Officials at Drexel said they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment .
4836,"In addition to $ 33 million compensatory damages , the suit seeks $ 100 million in punitive damages ."
4837,"Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp. , the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels ."
4838,Northview officials could n't be located .
4839,Financial Corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds .
4840,"Shortly before the visit , Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51 % stake in the company ."
4841,"However , the agreement was canceled in June 1984 ."
4842,"Financial Corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $ 11 million in losses on them , the company said ."
4843,Ideal Basic Industries Inc. said its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for HOFI North America Inc. to combine its North American cement holdings with Ideal in a transaction that will leave Ideal 's minority shareholders with 12.8 % of the combined company .
4844,"HOFI , the North American holding company of Swiss concern Holderbank Financiere Glaris Ltd. , previously proposed combining its 100 % stake in St. Lawrence Cement Inc. and its 60 % stake in Dundee Cement Co. with its 67 % stake in Ideal ."
4845,But HOFI 's first offer would have given Ideal 's other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company .
4846,"Ideal 's directors rejected that offer , although they said they endorsed the merger proposal ."
4847,"Under the agreement , HOFI will own 87.2 % of the combined company ."
4848,Ideal 's current operations will represent about 39.2 % of the combined company .
4849,The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by Ideal shareholders .
4850,Ideal said it expects to complete the transaction early next year .
4851,"While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought - induced peaks of 1988 , wheat prices remain stubbornly high ."
4852,"And they 're likely to stay that way for months to come , analysts say ."
4853,"For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say ."
4854,"And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat - growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies ."
4855,Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months .
4856,"By next May 31 , stocks of U.S. wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to 443 million bushels ."
4857,That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s .
4858,Stocks were 698 million bushels on May 31 of this year .
4859,"In response to dwindling domestic supplies , Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments ."
4860,The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels .
4861,"It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought - stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 ."
4862,But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year .
4863,"Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4 - a - bushel level , analysts say ."
4864,"On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged ."
4865,"In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply - demand squeeze , said Daniel Basse , a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago ."
4866,"Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade ."
4867,"In July , the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans ."
4868,"The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings ."
4869,Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market .
4870,"Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat - growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said Conrad Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago ."
4871,"For example , in the Oklahoma panhandle , 40 % or more of the topsoil is short of moisture ."
4872,"That figure climbs to about 47 % in wheat - growing portions of Kansas , he said ."
4873,"The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months , further supporting prices ."
4874,"`` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted Richard Feltes , vice president , research , for Refco Inc. in Chicago ."
4875,Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week :
4876,Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will go .
4877,"Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989 - 90 Florida orange crop ."
4878,"It was near the low range of estimates , at 130 million 90 - pound boxes , compared with 146.6 million boxes last season ."
4879,"However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 ."
4880,Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time .
4881,It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $ 1.3210 a pound .
4882,"Brazilian juice , after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities ."
4883,"Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in plentiful supply ."
4884,"The price cut , one analyst said , appeared to be aimed even more at Europe , where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen ."
4885,"It 's a dollar - priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst said ."
4886,New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at midyear .
4887,"Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak , the analyst said ."
4888,Energy
4889,"Although some analysts look for profit - taking in the wake of Friday 's leap in crude oil prices , last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week ."
4890,"`` I would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures '' trading , said William Hinton , an energy futures broker with Stotler & Co ."
4891,Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets .
4892,"On the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $ 20.89 a barrel , up 42 cents on the day ."
4893,"On European markets , meanwhile , spot prices of North Sea crudes were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel ."
4894,"`` This market still wants to go higher , '' said Nauman Barakat , a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc ."
4895,He predicted that the November contract will reach $ 21.50 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
4896,There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets .
4897,Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes .
4898,There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell .
4899,"Many traders foresee a tightening of near - term supplies , particularly of high - quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria ."
4900,"If a hostile predator emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , co-founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy - out attempt , an official close to the company said ."
4901,Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday 's stock - market sell - off in New York and turmoil in the junk - bond market .
4902,"But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks ."
4903,"Last week , Saatchi 's largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring ."
4904,"And Carl Spielvogel , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy - out of the company , but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi ."
4905,Mr. Spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid .
4906,"The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that `` if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders ."
4907,But -LCB- otherwise -RCB- it would undoubtedly come back '' with an offer by management .
4908,"The executive said any buy - out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi ."
4909,"Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big U.S. - based ad agencies ."
4910,"The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion ."
4911,The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy - back .
4912,"That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis - Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 ."
4913,"Mr. Louis - Dreyfus , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc. , has a reputation as a savvy financial manager , and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi 's poor financial state ."
4914,"Asked about the speculation that Mr. Louis - Dreyfus has been hired to pave the way for a buy - out by the brothers , the executive replied , `` That is n't the reason Dreyfus has been brought in ."
4915,He was brought in to turn around the company . ''
4916,"Separately , several Saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management shakeup will have little affect on them ."
4917,"`` It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , '' said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co. , a major client of Backer Spielvogel ."
4918,"John Lampe , director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc. , a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client , said : `` We have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about ."
4919,We are n't going to change agencies because of a change in London . ''
4920,"Executives at Backer Spielvogel client Avis Inc. , as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Co. , also said they saw no effect ."
4921,"Executives at Prudential - Bache Securities Inc. , a Backer Spielvogel client that is reviewing its account , declined comment ."
4922,"Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential - Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy - out and restructuring , or a buy - out of Backer Spielvogel alone , led by him ."

4934,KOREAN AGENCY :
4935,The Samsung Group and Bozell Inc. agreed to establish a joint venture advertising agency in South Korea .
4936,"Bozell Cheil Corp. , as the new agency will be called , will be based in Seoul and is 70 % owned by Samsung and 30 % owned by Bozell ."
4937,"Samsung already owns Korea First Advertising Co. , that country 's largest agency ."
4938,Bozell joins Backer Spielvogel Bates and Ogilvy Group as U.S. agencies with interests in Korean agencies .
4939,"Southmark Corp. said that it filed part of its 10 - K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission , but that the filing does n't include its audited financial statements and related information ."
4940,"The real estate and thrift concern , operating under bankruptcy - law proceedings , said it told the SEC it could n't provide financial statements by the end of its first extension `` without unreasonable burden or expense . ''"

4948,MedChem Products Inc. said a U.S. District Court in Boston ruled that a challenge by MedChem to the validity of a U.S. patent held by Pharmacia Inc. was `` without merit . ''
4949,"Pharmacia , based in Upsala , Sweden , had charged in a lawsuit against MedChem that MedChem 's AMVISC product line infringes on the Pharmacia patent ."
4950,"The patent is related to hyaluronic acid , a rooster - comb extract used in eye surgery ."
4951,"In its lawsuit , Pharmacia is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block MedChem from selling the AMVISC products ."
4952,A MedChem spokesman said the products contribute about a third of MedChem 's sales and 10 % to 20 % of its earnings .
4953,"In the year ended Aug. 31 , 1988 , MedChem earned $ 2.9 million , or 72 cents a share , on sales of $ 17.4 million ."
4954,MedChem said the court 's ruling was issued as part of a `` first - phase trial '' in the patent - infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case .
4955,"It said it is considering `` all of its options in light of the decision , including a possible appeal . ''"
4956,"The medical - products company added that it plans to `` assert its other defenses '' against Pharmacia 's lawsuit , including the claim that it has n't infringed on Pharmacia 's patent ."
4957,MedChem said that the court scheduled a conference for next Monday -- to set a date for proceedings on Pharmacia 's motion for a preliminary injunction .
4958,"General Motors Corp. , in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle - making capacity ."
4959,"In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full - sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories ."
4960,GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade .
4961,"The company , currently using about 80 % of its North American vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 ."
4962,"Just a month ago , GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood , Ga. , the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987 ."
4963,"Now , GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s ."
4964,One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match .
4965,Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no - layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year .
4966,GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .
4967,"The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs ."
4968,"Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members ."
4969,"The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr. Yokich said ."
4970,"GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves : Production of full - sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint , Mich ."
4971,"That means two plants -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 ."
4972,"The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio ."
4973,"Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S. - Canada free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney ."
4974,But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec .
4975,"Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars ."
4976,"GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro - Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said ."
4977,That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures .
4978,"The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 ."
4979,"Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand ."
4980,"At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight - year - old A - body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A - body cars will die ."
4981,He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A - body cars into the mid-1990s .
4982,"At Pontiac , however , the Camaro - Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic - bodied , two - seater Pontiac Fiero model ."
4983,The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union - management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year .
4984,Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result .
4985,Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor - management cooperation 's failure .
4986,"Weatherford International Inc. said it canceled plans for a preferred - stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock , and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares ."
4987,"The company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding ."
4988,The exchange ratio was never established .
4989,Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange .
4990,"The energy - services concern said , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock ."
4991,"Weatherford suspended its preferred - dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future ."
4992,"Additionally , the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected to be offered in November ."
4993,"The company said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs Inc. , underwriters for the offering , were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over - allotments ."
4994,Proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt .
4995,Weatherford currently has approximately 11.1 million common shares outstanding .
4996,"The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden , a great zoo , its own charming Little Italy -LRB- on Arthur Avenue -RRB- and , of course , the Yankees ."
4997,"However , most people , having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx , look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe 's Sherman McCoy did in `` Bonfire of the Vanities '' -- as a wrong turn into hell ."
4998,"But Laura Cunningham 's Bronx , her childhood Bronx of the '50s , is something else altogether ."
4999,"In a lovely , novelistic memoir , `` Sleeping Arrangements '' -LRB- Knopf , 195 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , she remembers an exotic playground , peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic -LRB- real oddballs like her sexpot friend , the hell - kitten Diana , age five -RRB- ."
5000,"Ms. Cunningham , a novelist and playwright , has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall ."
5001,"She transforms her `` Bronx of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into the `` Babylonian Bronx , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue ."
5002,"In the Babylonian Bronx , Jewish working - class people lived in drab , Soviet - style buildings `` glamorized '' with names like AnaMor Towers -LRB- after owners Anna and Morris Snezak -RRB- , whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks , friezes of Pompeii ."
5003,"For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl : `` ... outwardly ordinary , inwardly ornate , owing all inspiration to heathen cultures . ''"
5004,"Sharp - witted and funny but never mean , she 's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote , if he 'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy ."
5005,"Little Lily , as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book , really was n't ordinary ."
5006,"She was raised , for the first eight years , by her mother , Rosie , whom she remembers as a loving liar , who realigned history to explain why Lily 's father did n't live with them ."
5007,"Rosie reinvented this man , who may or may not have known about his child , as a war hero for Lily 's benefit ."
5008,"Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure , who did n't interfere much with her child 's education on the streets ."
5009,"The games Bronx children played -LRB- holding kids down and stripping them , for example -RRB- seem tame by today 's crack standards , but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure ."
5010,"`` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirted with both , '' she writes ."
5011,She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements .
5012,"Her friend Susan , whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted , slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents ' bedroom , as though she were a temporary visitor ."
5013,Her friend Diana 's father was a professional thief ; they did n't seem to have any bedrooms at all .
5014,Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting .
5015,"When Rosie died , her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements ."
5016,"They painted the apartment orange , pink and white , according to her instructions ."
5017,"With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe , an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist -LRB- who rhymed river with liver in a love song -RRB- ; and Uncle Len , a mysterious part - time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an `` undercover President on a good - will mission . ''"
5018,They came by their strangeness honestly .
5019,"Lily 's grandmother , no cookie baker , excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album , and lugged around her perennial work - in - progress , `` Philosophy for Women . ''"
5020,"The book loses some momentum toward the end , when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family ."
5021,"For the most part , though , there 's much pleasure in her saucy , poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx ."
5022,"The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman 's latest novel , which flashes back to the New York of the '50s ."
5023,"But both the past and present worlds of `` The Current Climate '' -LRB- Atlantic Monthly Press , 200 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- feel cramped and static ."
5024,"For his sixth novel , Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work , `` About Harry Towns . ''"
5025,"Harry is now a 57 - year - old writer , whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out - of - synch ."
5026,"Harry fondly remembers the `` old '' days of the early '70s , when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong ."
5027,"`` An L.A. solution , '' explains Mr. Friedman ."
5028,"Line by line Mr. Friedman 's weary cynicism can be amusing , especially when he 's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up , immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it ."
5029,"Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife , who 's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug - seeking forays into Manhattan ."
5030,But it does n't take too many lines to figure Harry out .
5031,He 's a bore .
5032,Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho .
5033,"In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources , which was a part - owner of the smelter , that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program ."
5034,"The 21 - square - mile area is contaminated with lead , zinc and other metals ."
5035,"Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern , potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter 's cleanup costs ."
5036,"The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA , it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization . ''"
5037,"The company , which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday , said that $ 1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third - quarter statement ."
5038,"The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval , the company said ."
5039,Gulf Resources added that it `` will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law . ''
5040,"Under the agreement , Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock ."
5041,The company 's net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after the dividends are issued .
5042,"`` The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf 's reorganization , which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990 , '' said Lawrence R. Mehl , Gulf 's general counsel ."
5043,"In addition , Gulf must give the government 20 days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ 50 million that are made to the Bermuda - based holding company ."
5044,Gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ 150 million .
5045,"Separately , the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 to vote on its proposed reorganization ."
5046,The real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market .
5047,"In Manhattan , once - desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill ."
5048,"Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom ."
5049,"`` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , '' says Faith Consolo , senior vice president at Garrick - Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc ."
5050,"There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 ."
5051,"`` This further confuses retailers , '' she says ."
5052,`` They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ?
5053,Is this the wrong time to open a store ?
5054,Who is going to be in the space next door ? ''
5055,"In addition , Ms. Consolo says , tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one - quarter lower than landlords ' initial asking price ."
5056,"A handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents ."
5057,"And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau ."
5058,"But on average , Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say ."
5059,"That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 ."
5060,The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing .
5061,"`` As businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks , '' says Edward A. Friedman , senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc ."
5062,"He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market ."
5063,Hardest hit are what he calls `` secondary '' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents .
5064,"In these locations , Mr. Friedman says , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . ''"
5065,"Weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , exacerbates the problem for landlords ."
5066,"It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt ."
5067,"Hooker Corp. , parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman 's , is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner , Campeau Corp ."
5068,The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents .
5069,"But , despite the recent softening , for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s , when their leases were signed ."
5070,"Certainly , the recent drop in prices does n't mean Manhattan comes cheap ."
5071,New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities .
5072,"Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon ."
5073,"The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $ 100 a square foot , as do up - and - coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue ."
5074,"By contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in Boston , San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $ 100 a square foot ."
5075,And rents on Beverly Hills ' Rodeo Drive generally do n't exceed about $ 125 a square foot .
5076,The New York Stock Exchange said two securities will begin trading this week .
5077,"Precision Castparts Corp. , Portland , Ore. , will begin trading with the symbol PCP ."
5078,It makes investment castings and has traded over - the - counter .
5079,"Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC , an Edinburgh , Scotland , financial services company , will list American depositary shares , representing preferred shares , with the symbol RBSPr ."
5080,"It will continue to trade on the International Stock Exchange , London ."
5081,The American Stock Exchange listed shares of two companies .
5082,"AIM Telephones Inc. , a Parsippany , N.J. , telecommunications equipment supply company , started trading with the symbol AIM ."
5083,It had traded over - the - counter .
5084,"Columbia Laboratories Inc. , Miami , began trading with the symbol COB ."
5085,The pharmaceuticals maker had traded over - the - counter .
5086,The National Market System of the Nasdaq over - the - counter market listed shares of one company .
5087,"Employee Benefit Plans Inc. , a Minneapolis health - care services company , was listed with the symbol EBPI ."
5088,"When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today , the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure ."
5089,"For the first time , the 83 - year - old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority ."
5090,"This role reversal holds true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , Justices Thurgood Marshall , Harry Blackmun and John Stevens ."
5091,"But are these four players , three of them in their 80s , ready to assume a different role after 88 years , collectively , of service on the high court ?"
5092,"Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways ."
5093,Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it ; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad .
5094,"The four justices are no newcomers to dissent , often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court 's conservative drift ."
5095,"But always , in years past , they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases ."
5096,"Now , however , as the court 's new five - member conservative majority continues to solidify , victories for the liberals are rare ."
5097,"The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan , the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren ."
5098,"In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the height of the Warren Court 's power , Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court ."
5099,"Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions , with the contentious flag - burning ruling as his only big victory ."
5100,"But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech ."
5101,"`` Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , '' he said ."
5102,"Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future ."
5103,"He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions ."
5104,"Associates of 81 - year - old Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights ."
5105,"`` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech last month ."
5106,"He , like Justice Brennan , considers dissents highly important for the future , a point that has n't escaped legal scholars ."
5107,Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a `` generation - skipping '' flavor to current dissents .
5108,"The dissenters in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short - term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon ."
5109,"`` Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , '' he says ."
5110,"Justice Blackmun , who will turn 81 next month , also seems feisty about his new role ."
5111,"Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues , especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion , Roe vs. Wade ."
5112,Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years .
5113,And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August .
5114,"But his level of frustration showed in a recent , impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago ."
5115,"He concluded his remarks by quoting , emotionally and at some length , according to those present , the late Martin Luther King 's famous `` I Have a Dream '' speech from the 1963 March on Washington ."
5116,"Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others ."
5117,"If the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history , it also differs in an important way from recent history , court watchers say ."
5118,"`` The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited , '' says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School , `` but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created ."
5119,"The government sold the deposits of four savings - and - loan institutions , in its first wave of sales of big , sick thrifts , but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth ."
5120,"The four S&Ls were sold to large banks , as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated by the Resolution Trust Corp. since it was created in the S&L bailout legislation two months ago ."
5121,"Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , which has aggressively expanded its markets , particularly in Texas and Florida ."
5122,"A Canadian bank bought another thrift , in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank ."
5123,"Under these deals , the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets ."
5124,"These `` clean - bank '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later ."
5125,"In these four , for instance , the RTC is stuck with $ 4.51 billion in bad assets ."
5126,"Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5 % to 3.7 % for the deposits and branch systems , roughly in line with what analysts were expecting ."
5127,"The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks , as has been the case with previous deals ."
5128,"After that , the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts ."
5129,But it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps .
5130,"NCNB , for example , has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market , and in Florida , rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities ."
5131,"The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency ."
5132,"`` These thrifts are beached whales , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant based in Alexandria , Va ."
5133,"For example , the delay in selling People 's Heritage Savings , Salina , Kan. , with $ 1.7 billion in assets , has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch - by - branch , instead of as a whole institution ."
5134,NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets .
5135,"NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association , Houston , which had assets of $ 2.8 billion ."
5136,NCNB Texas National Bank will pay the RTC a premium of $ 129 million for $ 3.5 billion in deposits .
5137,"As a measure of the depths to which the Texas real estate market has sunk , the RTC will pay $ 3.8 billion to NCNB to take $ 750 million of bad assets ."
5138,"NCNB also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , which had total assets of $ 900 million ."
5139,NCNB will pay the RTC a premium of $ 40.4 million for $ 1.1 billion in deposits .
5140,"NCNB will also acquire $ 266 million of Freedom 's assets from the RTC , which will require $ 875 million in assistance ."
5141,"Meridian Bancorp Inc. , Reading , Pa. , will acquire Hill Financial Savings Association , Red Hill , Pa. , which had $ 2.3 billion in assets ."
5142,Meridian will pay a premium of $ 30.5 million to assume $ 2 billion in deposits .
5143,"It will also purchase $ 845 million of the thrift 's assets , with $ 1.9 billion in RTC assistance ."
5144,"In the first RTC transaction with a foreign buyer , Royal Trustco Ltd. , Toronto , will acquire Pacific Savings Bank , Costa Mesa , Calif. , which had $ 949 million in assets ."
5145,Royal Trustco will pay the RTC $ 25 million to assume $ 989 million in deposits .
5146,"It will also purchase $ 473 million in assets , and receive $ 550 million in assistance from the RTC ."
5147,The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission :
5148,"American Cyanamid Co. , offering of 1,250,000 common shares , via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets ."
5149,"Limited Inc. , offering of up to $ 300 million of debt securities and warrants ."
5150,"Nuveen California Performance Plus Municipal Fund Inc. , initial offering of five million common shares , via Alex . Brown & Sons Inc. , John Nuveen & Co. , Prudential - Bache Capital Funding , and Bateman Eichler , Hill Richards ."
5151,"PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. , proposed offering of 1.5 million common shares , of which 700,000 shares will be offered by PacifiCare and 800,000 shares by UniHealth America Inc . -LRB- PacifiCare 's 71 % -RRB- , via Dillon , Read & Co. Inc. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc ."

5153,"Trans World Airlines Inc. , offering of $ 150 million senior notes , via Drexel Burnham ."
5154,"Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways ."
5155,"In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 ."
5156,"In a related development , the news - weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four - color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 ."
5157,"However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher ."
5158,"Time is following the course of some other mass - circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers ."
5159,"In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers ."
5160,Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news - weeklies .
5161,"But Time , as part of the more cost - conscious Time Warner , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks ."
5162,"Besides , Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky ."
5163,"`` Giveaways just give people the wrong image , '' said Mr. Heinemann ."
5164,`` That perception takes the focus off the magazine . ''
5165,Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers .
5166,"`` What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it , '' said Mr. Heinemann ."
5167,`` We are trying to create quality and involvement . ''
5168,"However , Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million ."
5169,"And Time 's paid circulation , according to Audit Bureau of Circulations , dropped 7.3 % to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30 , 1989 ."
5170,"Still , Time 's move is being received well , once again ."
5171,"`` It 's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more , '' said Michael Drexler , national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency ."
5172,`` A few drops in circulation are of no consequence .
5173,It 's not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits . ''
5174,"Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away ."
5175,"`` The question is how much are we getting from each reader , '' said Mr. Heinemann ."
5176,"Time 's rivals news - weeklies , Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report , are less reliant on electronic giveaways , and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases ."
5177,Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month .
5178,"When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago , Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing ."
5179,"`` They said , ` follow CNN , ' '' he told reporters ."
5180,"That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news ."
5181,"It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks ."
5182,Its niche as the `` network of record '' during major crises draws elite audiences around the world .
5183,"But for all its success , CNN has hit a plateau ."
5184,"Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm ."
5185,CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable - TV .
5186,"`` Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , '' says Ed Turner , CNN 's executive vice president , news gathering -LRB- and no relation to Ted Turner -RRB- ."
5187,`` You ca n't live on that . ''
5188,"So CNN , a unit of Atlanta - based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network ."
5189,"Tonight , to kick off the effort , CNN will premiere its first prime - time newscast in years , an hourlong show at 6 p.m . Eastern time to air head - to - head against the network newscasts ."
5190,"The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier , a 34 - year - old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism ."
5191,The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full - length `` signature '' programming with recognizable stars .
5192,"To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global - news program ."
5193,It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers .
5194,And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative - reporting team .
5195,"`` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says Jon Petrovich , executive vice president of Headline News , CNN 's sister network ."
5196,But that wo n't be easy .
5197,"Networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change ."
5198,It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see .
5199,And the cable - TV operators -- CNN 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are .
5200,The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable - TV news market grows more competitive .
5201,"Already , CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future ."
5202,"In addition , many cable - TV systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations ."
5203,CNN wants to change its viewers ' habits .
5204,"Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel - zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research ."
5205,That 's less than one - third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks .
5206,"The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable - TV channels ."
5207,CNN 's viewer habits have been molded by its format .
5208,Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service .
5209,"It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks ."
5210,"It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look ."
5211,"Now , the push is on for more - distinctive shows ."
5212,"`` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says Paul Amos , CNN executive vice president for programming ."
5213,"Accordingly , CNN is adding a world - affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global - news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. Amos ."
5214,"And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` Larry King Live '' and `` Crossfire '' talk shows , which executives hope will keep people tuned in ."
5215,"Then there 's `` The World Today , '' the prime - time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier ."
5216,"Until now , CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period ."
5217,"But 70 % of the cable - television - equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered , so CNN wants in ."
5218,"Mr. Amos says the Shaw - Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to CNN 's other newcasts ."
5219,Some in the industry are skeptical .
5220,"`` I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says Reuven Frank , the former two - time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley - Brinkley Report ."
5221,The evening news is also slated as CNN 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism .
5222,"In August , the network hired award - winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news specials at ABC ."
5223,"She 's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly , in - depth segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories ."
5224,"CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS ."
5225,"That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in - depth pieces ."
5226,"`` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil - Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job ."
5227,"The network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less - experienced work force ."
5228,"CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks ."
5229,Says Mr. Mosettig : `` CNN is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything .
5230,"But to improve , they 've really got to make the investment in people . ''"
5231,"In any case , cable - TV - system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN 's format ."
5232,They market cable - TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage .
5233,"`` We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general - interest , long - format programming , '' says Robert Stengel , senior vice president , programming , of Continental Cablevision Inc. , which holds a 2 % stake in Turner Broadcasting ."
5234,"The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco , contrary to your Sept. 8 article `` Court Backs Texaco 's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late . ''"
5235,The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound .
5236,"In the Pennzoil / Texaco litigation , the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound ; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound ."
5237,"Admittedly , the principle in the cases is the same ."
5238,But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts .
5239,"And the facts , as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits , were different ."
5240,"When you suggest otherwise , you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation ."

5242,"Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches , leaving the transaction in limbo ."
5243,"The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp. , whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements ."
5244,The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received .
5245,"The transaction , announced in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley ."
5246,"Terms were n't disclosed , but Valley Federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually ."
5247,"Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp. , which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements ."
5248,"Valley Federal , with assets of $ 3.3 billion , is based in Van Nuys ."
5249,"Imperial Corp. , based in San Diego , is the parent of Imperial Savings & Loan ."
5250,In the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ 33.1 million .
5251,Call it the `` we 're too broke to fight '' defense .
5252,"Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers , developers and creditors ."
5253,"The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments ."
5254,"Though the argument may have a common - sense ring to it , even the S&L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position ."
5255,"Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law ."
5256,"The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year ."
5257,"The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate - court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch , best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team ."
5258,Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch .
5259,"Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party , including FSLIC . ''"
5260,"`` If true , '' the court wrote , `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds . ''"
5261,But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas .
5262,"Charles Haworth , a lawyer for Sunbelt , says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits , because Sunbelt 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ 2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988 ."
5263,"`` This institution is just brain dead , '' says Mr. Haworth , a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth , a Houston law firm ."
5264,"But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group , the developer of Valley Ranch , dismisses such arguments as a `` defense du jour . ''"
5265,"Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award , including the reversal of Sunbelt 's foreclosure on Valley Ranch ."
5266,"`` We 're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory , '' he says ."

5307,A group of Arby 's franchisees said they formed an association to oppose Miami Beach financier Victor Posner 's control of the restaurant chain .
5308,The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between the franchisees and Mr. Posner that began in August .
5309,"At the time , a group called R.B. Partners Ltd. , consisting of eight of Arby 's largest franchisees , offered more than $ 200 million to buy Arby 's Inc. , which is part of DWG Corp ."
5310,DWG is a holding company controlled by Mr. Posner .
5311,"One week later , Leonard H. Roberts , president and chief executive officer of Arby 's , was fired in a dispute with Mr. Posner ."
5312,"Friday , 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to `` preserve the integrity of the Arby 's system . ''"
5313,"The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system ."
5314,We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system . ''
5315,"The group said it would consider , among other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a class - action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings ."
5316,"In Florida , Renee Mottram , a senior vice president at DWG , responded : `` We do n't think any individual or group should disrupt a winning system or illegally interfere with existing contractual relationships for their own self - serving motives ."
5317,"September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday ."
5318,"After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer ."
5319,"Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline ."
5320,"Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped ."
5321,"Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion ."
5322,"That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy ."
5323,"`` I think the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago ."
5324,But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers .
5325,"`` The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers ."
5326,"But Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump ."
5327,"`` I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , '' he said ."
5328,`` The core rate is not really out of line . ''
5329,"All year , energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods ."
5330,"Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter , when a steep run - up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double - digit annual rates ."
5331,"Energy prices then plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months ."
5332,"Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department said ."
5333,"While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 ."
5334,"Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August ."
5335,"Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain ."
5336,"Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated ."
5337,"`` I think the resurgence -LCB- in inflation -RCB- is going to continue for a few months , '' said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm ."
5338,"He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world - wide ."
5339,"But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler - Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests ."
5340,"`` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad - based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained ."
5341,"Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer ."
5342,"Many analysts said the September increase was a one - time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models ."
5343,"Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase ."
5344,"Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in September , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % ."
5345,"Food prices declined 0.6 % , after climbing 0.3 % in August ."
5346,"Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in September to $ 32.82 billion ."
5347,"But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , analysts said ."
5348,"Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7 % after declining 0.6 % in August , while sales of building materials fell 1.8 % after rising 1.7 % ."
5349,"Producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4 % in September , after dropping for three consecutive months ."
5350,"Prices for crude goods , an array of raw materials , jumped 1.1 % after declining 1.9 % in August and edging up 0.2 % in July ."
5351,"Here are the Labor Department 's producer price indexes -LRB- 1982 = 100 -RRB- for September , before seasonal adjustment , and the percentage changes from September , 1988 ."
5352,"On a recent Saturday night , in the midst of West Germany 's most popular prime - time show , a contestant bet the host that she could name any of 100 different cheeses after just one nibble , while blindfolded ."
5353,The woman won the bet .
5354,"But perhaps even more remarkable , the three - hour - show , `` Wetten Dass '' -LRB- Make a Bet -RRB- , regularly wins the top slot in the country 's TV ratings , sometimes drawing as many as 50 % of West German households ."
5355,"As the 1992 economic integration approaches , Europe 's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American `` cultural imperialism , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as `` Dallas , '' `` Miami Vice '' and `` L.A. Law . ''"
5356,But much of what the Europeans want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out .
5357,"The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of Europe 's TV shows be produced in Europe ."
5358,"So far , the French have failed to win enough broad - based support to prevail ."
5359,A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why .
5360,"While there are some popular action and drama series , few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect ."
5361,"More European air time is filled with low - budget game shows , variety hours , movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized knock - offs of their American counterparts ."
5362,One of France 's most popular Saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar - school classmates for on - air reunions .
5363,A Flemish game show has as its host a Belgian pretending to be Italian .
5364,"One of Italy 's favorite shows , `` Fantastico , '' a tepid variety show , is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product , `` Cacao Fantastico , '' whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls -- even though the product did n't exist ."
5365,"Topping the cheese stunt , on another typical evening of fun on `` Wetten Dass , '' a contestant won a bet with the show 's host , Thomas Gottschalk , that he could identify 300 German dialects over the telephone ."
5366,"A celebrity guest , U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Richard Burt , also won a bet that someone could pile up $ 150 worth of quarters on a slanted coin ."
5367,"Mr. Burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister Hans - Dietrich Genscher frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes ."
5368,"If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get ."
5369,"European programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that ."
5370,"Mega-hits in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain , and almost never show up on U.S. screens ."
5371,Attempts to produce `` pan-European '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment .
5372,"One annual co-production , the three - hour - long `` Eurovision Song Contest , '' featuring soft - rock songs from each of 20 European countries , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show ."
5373,"Another , `` Jeux Sans Frontieres , '' where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in France ."
5374,A U.S. - made imitation under the title `` Almost Anything Goes '' flopped fast .
5375,"For the most part , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason ."
5376,"The cream of the British crop , the literary dramas that are shown on U.S. public television as `` Masterpiece Theater , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time ."
5377,Most British programming is more of an acquired taste .
5378,"There is , for instance , `` One Man and His Dog , '' a herding contest among sheep dogs ."
5379,"Also riveting to the British are hours of dart - throwing championships , even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons ."
5380,"European drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes ."
5381,The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns .
5382,"A French knock - off of `` Dallas , '' called `` Chateauvallon '' and set in a French vineyard , had a good run in France , which ended after the female lead was injured in a real - life auto accident ."
5383,"`` Schwarzwaldklinik , '' -LRB- Black Forest Clinic -RRB- , a kind of German `` St . Elsewhere '' set in a health spa , is popular in Germany , and has spread into France ."
5384,"Italy 's most popular series is a drama called `` La Piovra , '' or `` The Octopus , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia ."
5385,It was front - page news in Italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series .
5386,"Spain 's most popular mini-series this year was `` Juncal , '' the story of an aging bullfighter ."
5387,"`` The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with American programs second , '' says Brian Wenham , a former director of programs for the British Broadcasting Corp ."
5388,"`` Given a choice , everybody will watch a home - produced show . ''"
5389,But frequently there is n't much choice .
5390,"Thus , Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal ."
5391,"`` We 've basically got to start from scratch , to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see , '' concedes Colin Young , head of Britain 's National Film Theatre School ."
5392,"While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry 's sluggish development ."
5393,"Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising ."
5394,"Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are ."
5395,"But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap - to - make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive - to - produce dramas ."
5396,"Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly ."
5397,"Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels ."
5398,The result is a new and huge appetite for programming .
5399,"But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the U.S. ."
5400,"Sky Channel , a British - based venture of Australian - American press tycoon Rupert Murdoch , offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience ."
5401,The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss 's other ventures .
5402,"In a Madrid hotel room recently , a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , only to be urged by the British announcer to `` stay tuned for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo . ''"
5403,"Lisa Grishaw - Mueller in Bonn , Laura Colby in Milan , Tim Carrington in London and Carlta Vitzhum in Madrid contributed to this article ."
5404,"British Aerospace PLC and France 's Thomson - CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided - missile divisions , greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors ."
5405,"The 50 - 50 joint venture , which may be dubbed Eurodynamics , would have combined annual sales of at least # 1.4 billion -LRB- $ 2.17 billion -RRB- and would be among the world 's largest missile makers ."
5406,"After two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance ."
5407,The companies hope for a final agreement by year - end .
5408,"The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting ."
5409,"In recent months , a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once - balkanized world of European arms manufacture ."
5410,"Already , British Aerospace and French government - controlled Thomson - CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air - traffic control radar system ."
5411,"Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC , a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit ."
5412,The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson - CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe 's defense industry .
5413,"Most threatened by closer British Aerospace - Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals , including Matra S.A. in France and Britain 's General Electric Co. PLC ."
5414,"But neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford , Conn. - based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces ."
5415,"Yesterday , a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight , as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson - CSF ."
5416,"Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra , Britain 's Dowty Group PLC , West Germany 's Daimler - Benz AG , and France 's Dassault group ."
5417,"But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated ."
5418,"GEC plans first to study Ferranti 's financial accounts , which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit , International Signal & Control Group , with which Ferranti merged last year ."
5419,"Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators ; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense - electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry ."
5420,"A consortium bid , however , would diminish GEC 's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials ."
5421,"A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti : `` Competition is the name of the game , '' she said ."
5422,"At least one potential GEC partner , Matra , insists it is n't interested in Ferranti ."
5423,"`` We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a Matra official said Sunday ."
5424,"The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting ."
5425,"For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices ."
5426,The venture 's importance for Thomson is great .
5427,Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans .
5428,"The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler - Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt - Boelkow Blohm G.m.b . H ."
5429,"In missiles , Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival , France 's Aerospatiale S.A. ; to better compete , Thomson officials say , they need a partnership ."
5430,"To justify 50 - 50 ownership of the planned venture , Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace ."
5431,"Annual revenue of British Aerospace 's missile business is about # 950 million , a Thomson spokesman said ."
5432,British Aerospace 's chief missile products include its 17 - year - old family of Rapier surface - to - air missiles .
5433,"Thomson missile products , with about half British Aerospace 's annual revenue , include the Crotale surface - to - air missile family ."
5434,"Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two - step , 830 million Canadian - dollar -LRB- US$ 705.6 million -RRB- expansion of its system because Canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking ."
5435,"Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate ."
5436,"Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level ."
5437,"`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc ."
5438,"Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s ."
5439,"`` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said ."
5440,"Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly ."
5441,"The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group ."
5442,"Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada ."
5443,"Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude ."
5444,"Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal ."
5445,"Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York - based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation ."
5446,"That ranks Canada as the fourth - largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico ."
5447,"Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast - shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East ."
5448,`` It 's very much a growing concern .
5449,"But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , '' he said ."
5450,"Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude , however , since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada 's falling output ."
5451,"Under terms of its proposed two - step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 ."
5452,The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day .
5453,Population Drain Ends For Midwestern States
5454,IOWA IS MAKING a comeback .
5455,"So are Indiana , Ohio and Michigan ."
5456,"The population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new Census Bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s ."
5457,"The gains , to be sure , are rather small ."
5458,"Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau says ."
5459,"Still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since 1981 ."
5460,"Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people ."
5461,"Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin ."
5462,The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race .
5463,"Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including New York , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s ."
5464,"And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again ."
5465,"At the same time , several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround ."
5466,"Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Montana , Wyoming and Alaska ."
5467,"Overall , though , the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest , and fast - growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue ."
5468,But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing .
5469,More Elderly Maintain Their Independence
5470,"THANKS TO modern medicine , more couples are growing old together ."
5471,"And even after losing a spouse , more of the elderly are staying independent ."
5472,"A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64 % of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988 , up from 59 % in 1970 ."
5473,"This does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone , however ."
5474,That share has remained at about 24 % since 1970 .
5475,"What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives , such as children ."
5476,"In 1988 , 10 % of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses , down from 15 % in 1970 ."
5477,"As people get even older , many become widowed ."
5478,"But even among those aged 75 and older , the share living with a spouse rose slightly , to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 ."
5479,"Like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives ."
5480,"Only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970 ."
5481,The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40 % from 32 % .
5482,More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially .
5483,Careers Count Most For the Well - to - Do
5484,MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family .
5485,"At least that 's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman indicates ."
5486,"Two - thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families ."
5487,Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group .
5488,"Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich ."
5489,"Average household income for the sample was $ 194,000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 775,000 ."
5490,"The goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest - growing income groups , the upper - middle class ."
5491,"Although they represent only 2 % of the population , they control nearly one - third of discretionary income ."
5492,"Across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive ."
5493,"Despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and one - fourth do n't feel that they have made it ."
5494,Twenty percent do n't even feel they are financially well off .
5495,"Many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either ."
5496,About 40 % do n't feel they 're more able than others .
5497,"While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent , only 25 % give $ 2,500 or more to charity each year ."
5498,"Thirty - five percent attend religious services regularly ; at the same time , 60 % feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles ."
5499,Odds and Ends
5500,THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 .
5501,"The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 ."
5502,The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... .
5503,"Per - capita personal income in the U.S. grew faster than inflation last year , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis ."
5504,"The amount of income divvied up for each man , woman and child was $ 16,489 in 1988 , up 6.6 % from $ 15,472 in 1987 ."
5505,"Per capita personal income ranged from $ 11,116 in Mississippi to $ 23,059 in Connecticut ... ."
5506,"There are 13.1 million students in college this fall , up 2 % from 1988 , the National Center for Education Statistics estimates ."
5507,"About 54 % are women , and 44 % are part - time students ."
5508,This small Dallas suburb 's got trouble .
5509,Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool .
5510,"More than 30 years ago , Prof. Harold Hill , the con man in Meredith Willson 's `` The Music Man , '' warned the citizens of River City , Iowa , against the game ."
5511,"Now kindred spirits on Addison 's town council have barred the town 's fanciest hotel , the Grand Kempinski , from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge ."
5512,Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison 's main street .
5513,"And the mayor , in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Prof. Hill 's , warned that `` alcohol leads to betting , which leads to fights . ''"
5514,The council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years .
5515,"`` Obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on , '' says Tom Manske , vice president of the National Pocket Billiards Association ."
5516,"Pool is hot in New York and Chicago , he insists , where `` upscale , suit - and - tie places '' are adding tables ."
5517,"With today 's tougher drunk driving laws , he adds , `` people do n't want to just sit around and drink . ''"
5518,"Besides , rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the Grand Kempinski , where rooms average $ 200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ 3.50 a pop ."
5519,"At the lounge , manager Elizabeth Dyer wo n't admit patrons in jeans , T - shirts or tennis shoes ."
5520,But a majority of the Addison council did n't buy those arguments .
5521,"Introducing pool , argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker , would be `` dangerous ."
5522,It would open a can of worms . ''
5523,"Addison is no stranger to cans of worms , either ."
5524,"After its previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's coffers for trips and retreats ."
5525,"The revelations embarrassed town officials , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested ."
5526,Now comes the pool flap .
5527,"`` I think there 's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous , '' Councilman John Nolan says ."
5528,`` I thought this was all taken care of in ` The Music Man .
5529,"The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS 's new show `` Island Son '' -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept. 25 -RRB- was the local color ; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework ."
5530,For instance : `` Haole '' -LRB- white -RRB- is not the ultimate insult ; `` Mainland haole '' is .
5531,"Richard Chamberlain dresses as a `` Mainland haole , '' tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves ."
5532,"And the local expression for brother is `` brah , '' not `` bruddah . ''"
5533,"And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty , if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left , not right , ear ."
5534,"Sorry , the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color ."

5536,"Of all the ethnic tensions in America , which is the most troublesome right now ?"
5537,A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City .
5538,"Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason , the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights -LRB- 9:30 - 10 p.m. EDT -RRB- ."
5539,"Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water ."
5540,"Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company ."
5541,"Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically ."
5542,"He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically ."
5543,He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa .
5544,"Of course , Mr. Mason did not use neutral language ."
5545,"As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular ."
5546,"He said Jews were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . ''"
5547,"If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ?"
5548,"It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language ."
5549,"In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism ."
5550,"For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur ."
5551,People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ''
5552,"These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double - edged , aiming inward as well as outward ."
5553,"The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves ."
5554,"In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons ."
5555,"But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief ."
5556,Why constructive ?
5557,"Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict ."
5558,"That 's why it 's dangerous to have well - intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences ."
5559,"As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . ''"
5560,"The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?"
5561,"Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy ."
5562,It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue - collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show . ''
5563,But these are not the differences that make headlines .
5564,"In `` Chicken Soup , '' Mr. Mason plays Jackie , a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie -LRB- Lynn Redgrave -RRB- , an Irish widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother -LRB- Rita Karin -RRB- and her brother Michael -LRB- Brandon Maggart -RRB- ."
5565,It 's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants .
5566,"At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do Jackie and Maddie ."
5567,It could n't be more obvious that `` Chicken Soup '' is being made from an old recipe .
5568,And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam .
5569,"Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` Abie 's Irish Rose '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain ."
5570,"And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called `` Bridget Loves Bernie , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real - life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney ."
5571,"Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all ."
5572,"So far , the bubbles have been few and far between ."
5573,"Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues ."
5574,"To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them ."
5575,"For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well - paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker ."
5576,Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .
5577,"The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself ."
5578,"But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences ."
5579,I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic - Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz .
5580,"That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer ."
5581,But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America .
5582,"At your age , Jackie , you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame ."
5583,"The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a 60 - year history of calm , right up through Friday ."
5584,Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement Friday that the stock - market decline `` does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy . ''
5585,"`` The economy , '' he added , `` remains well - balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ''"
5586,Sound familiar ?
5587,Here 's what Ronald Reagan said after the 1987 crash : `` The underlying economy remains sound .
5588,There is nothing wrong with the economy ... all the indices are up . ''
5589,Heard that before ?
5590,"After the 1929 crash , Herbert Hoover said : `` The fundamental business of the country ... is on a sound and prosperous basis ."
5591,"James Robinson , 57 years old , was elected president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives ."

5594,"The former president and chief executive , Eric W. Markrud , resigned in June ."
5595,The Senate 's decision to approve a bare - bones deficit - reduction bill without a capital - gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year .
5596,"Late Friday night , the Senate voted 87 - 7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit ."
5597,Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special - interest tax breaks and spending increases .
5598,"`` We 're putting a deficit - reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit - reduction bill , '' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser -LRB- D. , Tenn . -RRB- ."
5599,"But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital - gains tax cut ."
5600,"In addition , the companion deficit - reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital - gains provision ."
5601,House - Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while .
5602,"`` No one can predict exactly what will happen on the House side , '' said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , Kan . -RRB- ."
5603,"But , he added , `` I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital - gains reform this year . ''"
5604,White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital - gains cut in the final version of the bill .
5605,"`` We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , '' he said ."
5606,"House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- said in an interview , `` If that 's the signal that comes from the White House , that will help a great deal . ''"
5607,The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital - gains tax cut less certain this year .
5608,Opponents of the cut are playing hardball .
5609,"Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said he was `` confident '' that any House - Senate agreement on the deficit - reduction legislation would n't include a capital - gains tax cut ."
5610,"And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation originates , said there are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year . ''"
5611,"One obvious place to attach a capital - gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit - reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit ."
5612,Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month .
5613,The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit - reduction through Congress .
5614,"Because the legislation has n't been completed , President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across - the - board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm - Rudman deficit - reduction law ."
5615,Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill .
5616,The House appears reluctant to join the senators .
5617,A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions .
5618,"`` Although I am encouraged by the Senate action , '' said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate . ''"
5619,Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks .
5620,He has been resisting a stripped - down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital - gains tax cut .
5621,"But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital - gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill ."
5622,"The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue - losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the House - passed bill ."
5623,These include a child - care initiative and extensions of soon - to - expire tax breaks for low - income housing and research - and - development expenditures .
5624,"Also missing from the Senate bill is the House 's repeal of a law , called Section 89 , that compels companies to give rank - and - file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives ."
5625,"One high - profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts ."
5626,Mr. Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon .
5627,"To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician - reimbursement system under Medicare ."
5628,"To the detriment of many low - income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken ."
5629,"Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , said , `` We 're looking like idiots ."
5630,Things had just gone too far . ''
5631,Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator .
5632,"It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue - losing provisions were stricken ."
5633,The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced .
5634,"In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long - distance telephone calls ."
5635,"It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed - contract method of accounting , which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden ."
5636,It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees .
5637,"Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties , which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 ."
5638,A provision that would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was excised .
5639,"The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell , who had proposed the streamlining ."
5640,"Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director Darman , who pushed for a capital - gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill ."
5641,"The deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion over five years ."
5642,"The revenue - raising provisions , which affect mostly corporations , would :"
5643,"-- Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy - outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy - outs , effective Aug. 2 , 1989 ."
5644,"-- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received , effective the day after the tax bill is enacted ."
5645,"-- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans , effective June 6 , 1989 , that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers ."
5646,"The measure repeals a 50 % exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP , if the ESOP owns less than 30 % of the employer 's stock ."
5647,"-- Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities , such as zero - coupon bonds , that postpone cash interest payments ."
5648,-- Raise $ 851 million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes .
5649,"-- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies , effective August 1990 ."
5650,"-- Impose a tax on ozone - depleting chemicals , such as those used in air conditioners and in Styrofoam , beginning at $ 1.10 a pound starting next year ."
5651,-- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding .
5652,"-- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly , effective next year ."
5653,-- Restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash .
5654,"-- Increase to $ 6 a person from $ 3 the international air - passenger departure tax , and impose a $ 3 - a - person tax on international departures by commercial ships ."
5655,The measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees .
5656,Among its provisions :
5657,"-- Reduction of Medicare spending in fiscal 1990 by some $ 2.8 billion , in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians ."
5658,The plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year .
5659,"-- Removal of the U.S. Postal Service 's operating budget from the federal budget , reducing the deficit by $ 1.77 billion ."
5660,A similar provision is in the House version .
5661,"-- Authority for the Federal Aviation Administration to raise $ 239 million by charging fees for commercial airline - landing rights at New York 's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports , O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and National Airport in Washington ."
5662,-- Increases in Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees totaling $ 54 million .
5663,-- Direction to the U.S. Coast Guard to collect $ 50 million from users of Coast Guard services .
5664,"-- Raising an additional $ 43 million by increasing existing Federal Communications Commission fees and penalties and establishing new fees for amateur radio operators , ship stations and mobile radio facilities ."

5710,"`` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned . ''"
5711,"Thus , she says , if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below 2450 , `` It would just be a fluke ."
5712,My advice is to buy . ''
5713,"As she calculates it , the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies ' earnings ."
5714,"She says that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . ''"
5715,Ned Davis .
5716,"Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc ."
5717,"But Mr. Davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987 - style crash ."
5718,"`` There was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he says ."
5719,`` Margin debt was at a record high .
5720,There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds .
5721,"The main thing was portfolio insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses . ``"
5722,A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject '' to it .
5723,"In 1987 , such selling contributed to a snowball effect ."
5724,"Today could even be an up day , Mr. Davis says , if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading ."
5725,"Over the next several months , though , he says things look bad ."
5726,"`` I think the market will be heading down into November , '' he says ."
5727,"`` We will probably have a year - end rally , and then go down again ."
5728,Sort of a two - step bear market . ''
5729,He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year .
5730,"`` That would be a normal bear market , '' he says ."
5731,`` I guess that 's my forecast . ''
5732,Leon G. Cooperman .
5733,`` I do n't think the market is going through another October '87 .
5734,"I do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says Mr. Cooperman , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management ."
5735,"Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush ."
5736,"`` I expect the market to open weaker Monday , but then it should find some stability . ''"
5737,He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago .
5738,"Unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year ."
5739,"Unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong ."
5740,"And unlike 1987 , the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating ."
5741,"But the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits `` is n't good , '' he says ."
5742,`` So it 's a very mixed bag . ''
5743,"Thus , he concludes , `` This is not a good environment to be fully invested '' in stocks ."
5744,"`` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying ."
5745,"But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . ``"
5746,We 're going to look for some of the better - known companies that got clocked '' Friday .
5747,John Kenneth Galbraith .
5748,"`` This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity , '' says Mr. Galbraith , an economist ."
5749,"`` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says ."
5750,`` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity .
5751,This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . ''
5752,"Nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely ."
5753,"`` There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , '' he says ."
5754,`` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the Thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try . ''
5755,Mario Gabelli .
5756,"New York money manager Mario Gabelli , an expert at spotting takeover candidates , says that takeovers are n't totally gone ."
5757,"`` Companies are still going to buy companies around the world , '' he says ."
5758,"Examples are `` Ford looking at Jaguar , BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting . ''"
5759,"These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue ."
5760,"`` The market was up 35 % since -LCB- President -RCB- Bush took office , '' Mr. Gabelli says , so a correction was to be expected ."
5761,"He thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during Friday 's plunge ."
5762,"`` Stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity -LCB- this -RCB- week for guys like me , '' he says ."
5763,Jim Rogers .
5764,"`` It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , '' says Mr. Rogers , a professor of finance at Columbia University and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , Quantum Fund ."
5765,"He sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the U.S. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession ."
5766,"`` Friday you could n't sell dollars , '' he says ."
5767,"Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . ''"
5768,"If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much ."
5769,Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go .
5770,"He recommends that investors sell takeover - related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness ."
5771,Frank Curzio .
5772,Many people now claim to have predicted the 1987 crash .
5773,Queens newsletter writer Francis X. Curzio actually did it : He stated in writing in September 1987 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month .
5774,Mr. Curzio says what happens now will depend a good deal on the Federal Reserve Board .
5775,"If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he says , `` That could quiet things down . ''"
5776,"If not , `` We could go to 2200 very soon . ''"
5777,Frank W. Terrizzi .
5778,"Stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says Mr. Terrizzi , president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati ."
5779,"Renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally ."
5780,"Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily U.S. Treasury bills ."
5781,"`` T - bills probably are the right place to be , '' he says ."
5782,"Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing , alleging :"
5783,1 . That your Sept. 28 editorial `` Kangaroo Committees '' was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading .
5784,I thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative .
5785,2 . That Mr. Lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the Fifth Amendment .
5786,"Yes , he did ."
5787,"As I watched him on C - Span , I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights , which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings ."
5788,He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution .
5789,He used about 56 words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights .
5790,"Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth ."
5791,He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary .
5792,"As your editorial rightly pointed out , Samuel Pierce , former HUD secretary , and Lance Wilson , Mr. Pierce 's former aide , `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment ."
5793,'' That certainly is not the supposed `` distorted reading '' indicated by Mr. Lantos .
5794,3 . That his `` committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD .
5795,My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court ... etc . ''
5796,Absolute rubbish .
5797,"By any `` reasonable man '' criterion , Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted ."
5798,"Apparently , their verdict is in ."
5799,Right now they 're pursuing evidence .
5800,"That 's not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard American practice ."
5801,How was that practice referred to when I was in school ?
5802,"Ah , yes , something called a Star Chamber ."
5803,"Of course , Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change ."
5804,No doubt that 's partially true .
5805,Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true .
5806,He 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior HUD officials .
5807,"But if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ?"
5808,Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ?
5809,"Such as , what happened when Congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ?"
5810,"No , Mr. Lantos 's complaints simply wo n't wash ."
5811,"4 . That the Journal defends `` the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence - peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD , '' etc. and so forth ."
5812,"No , to my mind , the Journal did not `` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence - peddling and abuse of the public trust ... ''"
5813,it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense .
5814,"The problem , which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. Lantos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary / judicial body ."
5815,"-LRB- Of course , we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . -RRB-"
5816,"The system is the problem , not an individual member ."
5817,Individuals can always have their hands slapped .
5818,It 's when such slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble .
5819,I do not by any means defend HUD management .
5820,"But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and , yes , maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate ."
5821,The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when `` Tail Gunner Joe '' McCarthy did his work .
5822,Raymond Weber
5823,"Parsippany , N.J ."
5824,I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination in congressional hearings .
5825,"The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . ''"
5826,This privilege against self - incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify .
5827,"Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . ''"
5828,"The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only ."
5829,The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . ''
5830,"Baxter v. Palmingiano , 425 U.S. 308 -LRB- 1976 -RRB- ."
5831,"Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter ."
5832,He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .
5833,"Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution ."
5834,"Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify ."
5835,"Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good - faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution ."
5836,"The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime ."
5837,Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self - incrimination .

5840,"It was Friday the 13th , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points ."
5841,Just a coincidence ?
5842,Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ?
5843,"In academia , a so - called Friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors ."
5844,"Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez , professors of finance at the University of Miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th ."
5845,"But their study , which spanned the 1962 - 85 period , has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data ."
5846,"In the '70s , the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you - know - what ."
5847,"But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to Yale Hirsch , a collector of stock market lore ."
5848,"Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940 - 1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices ."
5849,"On the only other Friday the 13th this year , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points ."
5850,"Professor Kolb says the original study , titled Friday the 13th , Part VII , was published tongue - in - cheek ."
5851,"In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity ."

5903,"Pension funds , insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday 's market rout ."
5904,And they plan to buy more today .
5905,"Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash : Buying at the bottom pays off ."
5906,"To be sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today ."
5907,They could still panic and bail out of the market .
5908,But their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse .
5909,"`` Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , '' said John W. Rogers , president of Chicago - based Ariel Capital Management Inc. , which manages $ 1.1 billion of stocks ."
5910,Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . ''
5911,He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further .
5912,Denver - based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday 's rout shaved $ 40 million from the value of the $ 752 million Janus Fund he oversees .
5913,"`` I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through , '' he said ."
5914,Then he jumped into the market :
5915,`` I spent $ 30 million in the last half - hour . ''
5916,Other money managers also opened their wallets .
5917,"`` I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn ."
5918,`` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . ''
5919,"Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock ."
5920,"Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best - performing long - term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone ."
5921,"`` If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , '' said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago - based Kemper Financial Services Inc ."
5922,"The $ 56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System , for one , added $ 1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago ."
5923,"`` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long - term holders , and that they ca n't react to short - term events , good or bad , '' said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif ."
5924,"`` Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it , '' he said , `` so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline ."
5925,"Stocks , as measured by the Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index , have been stellar performers this year , rising 27.97 % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends ."
5926,"Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades ."
5927,"`` You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , '' said James D. Awad , president of New York - based BMI Capital Corp ."
5928,"Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days ."
5929,It can happen before you can turn around . ''
5930,"He said he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading ."
5931,"`` The only thing you do n't have , '' he said , `` is the ` portfolio insurance ' phenomenon overlaid on the rest . ''"
5932,"Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash ."
5933,"Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts ."
5934,"In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected ."
5935,"Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers said ."
5936,"Neil Weisman , whose New York - based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands ."
5937,"`` We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything , '' said Mr. Weisman , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers ."
5938,"Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again , trapping more investors ."
5939,"`` I think it will be a rigor mortis rally , '' he said ."
5940,"Meanwhile , Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally ."
5941,"Especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this year 's market climb ."
5942,"The shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price ."
5943,"The nation 's largest short - selling operation is Feshbach Brothers , Palo Alto , Calif. , which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point ."
5944,All that now has changed .
5945,"`` We 're ahead for the year because of Friday , '' said the firm 's Kurt Feshbach ."
5946,"`` We 're not making a killing , but we had a good day ."
5947,Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the U.S. Attorney 's office in Baltimore .
5948,"Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens , N.Y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes ."
5949,Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests .
5950,Mr. Nesbit also said the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic .
5951,"But so far the company has n't complied with that request , the spokesman said ."
5952,"Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , '' Mr. Nesbit said ."
5953,"Bolar , of Copiague , N.Y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug ."
5954,The FDA has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand - name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin .
5955,Bolar has denied that it switched the brand - name product for its own in such testing .
5956,The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands .
5957,The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management - controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders .
5958,"Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , ASKO 's Dutch lawyers noted ."
5959,"Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense , ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote - diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV ."
5960,ASKO says the Dutch - based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders .
5961,"Speaking through its Dutch lawyers , ASKO also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in Ahold ."
5962,It was previously thought ASKO held a 13.6 % stake that was accumulated since July .
5963,A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred - share issue .
5964,He termed ASKO 's legal actions as `` unproductive '' to international cooperation among European retailers .
5965,"Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican , but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush 's economic policy - making ."
5966,"`` There are some very significant issues out there , such as the fiscal deficit , the trade deficit , our relations with Japan , that have to be the subject of major initiatives , '' he said in an interview ."
5967,"`` I 'd like to see that initiative , and I have n't ."
5968,"There is n't a big shot , an agenda . ''"
5969,"A few hours later , the stock market dropped 190 points ."
5970,"Politicians tried to finger each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street 's woes ."
5971,But Mr. Butcher 's comments make one thing clear : Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy .
5972,Consider this :
5973,"-- By 11:59 p.m. tonight , President Bush must order $ 16 billion of automatic , across - the - board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm - Rudman budget law ."
5974,The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit - cutting bill .
5975,"`` We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- said yesterday on NBC News 's `` Meet the Press . ''"
5976,"-- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy ."
5977,The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been resisting .
5978,"`` One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said Lawrence Kudlow , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This Week . ''"
5979,-- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers .
5980,"Last month , Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines ."
5981,But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision .
5982,"And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC ."
5983,Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop .
5984,"In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508 - point crash ."
5985,"Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold ."
5986,"The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve ."
5987,And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous .
5988,"The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two - year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period ."
5989,"But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year ."
5990,"Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit - reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far - reaching than last spring 's gimmick - ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented ."
5991,"One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one - day 508 - point tumble ."
5992,"`` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. Panetta said yesterday in an interview ."
5993,`` That did not happen .
5994,They learned they could survive it without much problem . ''
5995,"But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . ''"
5996,"In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around ."
5997,"`` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- ."
5998,"Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190 - point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital - gains fight ."
5999,Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital - gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit - reduction legislation .
6000,"`` There is no prospect of any so - called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said yesterday on CBS News 's `` Face the Nation . ''"
6001,"During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit - cutting bill and the capital - gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds ."
6002,"At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit - reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it ."
6003,"When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax - writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it ."
6004,"Asked if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : `` The adminstration will have to speak for itself . ''"
6005,"Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit - reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest ."
6006,"Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit ."
6007,"`` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman -LRB- R. , N.H . -RRB- . said yesterday ."
6008,"The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm - Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House - passed deficit - reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion ."
6009,"Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across - the - board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''"
6010,No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday 's drop in the stock market .
6011,But some players were quick to seize the moment .
6012,"Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply - side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains ."
6013,"`` Investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he said ."
6014,"`` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital - gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others ."
6015,Honeywell Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. received Air Force contracts to develop integrated circuits for use in space .
6016,"Honeywell 's contract totaled $ 69.7 million , and IBM 's $ 68.8 million ."
6017,Boeing Co. received a $ 46.7 million Air Force contract for developing cable systems for the Minuteman Missile .
6018,General Dynamics Corp. received a $ 29 million Air Force contract for electronic - warfare training sets .
6019,Grumman Corp. received an $ 18.1 million Navy contract to upgrade aircraft electronics .
6020,Avco Corp. received an $ 11.8 million Army contract for helicopter engines .
6021,"Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused Spain 's September consumer price index to shoot up 1.1 % from the previous month , pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8 % , the National Institute of Statistics said Friday ."
6022,The monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years .
6023,"The index , which registered 156.8 at the end of September , has a base of 100 set in 1983 and is n't seasonally adjusted ."
6024,"Prices have risen 5.9 % in the first nine months of the year , outstripping both the initial 3 % inflation goal set by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the second , revised goal of 5.8 % ."
6025,"Japan 's wholesale prices in September rose 3.3 % from a year earlier and were up 0.4 % from the previous month , the Bank of Japan announced Friday ."
6026,"The wholesale price index stood at 90.1 , compared with a 1985 base of 100 ."
6027,Ford Motor Co. said it acquired 5 % of the shares in Jaguar PLC .
6028,"Jaguar , the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of the transactions , the company said ."
6029,The U.S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it would n't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15 % of Jaguar shares .
6030,"The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15 % of the British luxury - car maker , the maximum allowed under current United Kingdom government restrictions ."
6031,General Motors Corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares .
6032,GM said it still is talking with Jaguar about acquiring a minority interest .
6033,"Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop ."
6034,That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .
6035,"In October 1987 , these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market ."
6036,"Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value ."
6037,"If the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities ."
6038,But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls .
6039,"Margin calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said ."
6040,"Merrill Lynch & Co. officials `` do n't expect -LCB- margin calls -RCB- to be as big a factor as in 1987 '' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman said ."
6041,"Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp. , the San Francisco - based discount brokerage firm , said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers ."
6042,He said Schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a cushion . ''
6043,He added : `` We learned a lesson in 1987 about volatility .
6044,"Avis Inc. , following rival Hertz Corp. 's lead , said it is backing out of frequent - flier programs with three airlines ."
6045,"The Garden City , N.Y. , car - rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year ."
6046,But it remains involved in programs with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines .
6047,Industry estimates put Avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million .
6048,A spokesman for Avis would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for `` far less than half '' of the total .
6049,"Budget Rent a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car Rental Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit ."
6050,"In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent - flier miles and fliers can get car - rental discounts ."
6051,"`` I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs , '' said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning ."
6052,Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements .
6053,"National also participates in the Northwest frequent - flier program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit ."
6054,"A month ago , Hertz , of Park Ridge , N.J. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta , America West and Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines , and that pacts with American Airlines , UAL Inc 's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended ... sometime after Dec. 31 ."
6055,"At the time , Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $ 15 million ."
6056,"Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high ."
6057,Budget said its frequent - flier costs are `` substantially below '' Avis 's level .
6058,"Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to -LCB- frequent - flier programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value . ''"
6059,"This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis , said Charles Finnie , car - rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons ."
6060,"`` They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , '' he said ."
6061,CBS Inc. is cutting `` The Pat Sajak Show '' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes .
6062,"CBS insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the late - night talk show format since 1972 ."
6063,"`` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August ."
6064,`` This will raise the energy level of the show . ''
6065,CBS will continue to program action - adventure shows to follow the Sajak hour .
6066,But CBS News will extend its four - hour `` Nightwatch '' by 30 minutes and begin at 1:30 a.m .
6067,"The show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co. , finishing far below `` Tonight '' on NBC , a unit of General Electric Co. , and `` Nightline '' on ABC - TV , a unit of Capital Cities / ABC Inc ."
6068,"Further fractioning the late - night audience is the addition of the `` Arsenio Hall Show , '' syndicated by Paramount Communications Inc ."
6069,Do n't jump yet .
6070,The stock market 's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy .
6071,"In one wild hour of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for weeks ."
6072,It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar .
6073,"The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business -- indeed , the entire economy ."
6074,This may sound strangely optimistic .
6075,"After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy ."
6076,"When it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed ."
6077,"That has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock - market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable ."
6078,"The 1987 crash was `` a false alarm however you view it , '' says University of Chicago economist Victor Zarnowitz ."
6079,The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation .
6080,"Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy ."
6081,"`` The market today has a life of its own , '' John Akers , chairman of International Business Machines Corp. , said Saturday ."
6082,`` There 's nothing rational about this kind of action . ''
6083,"Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week ."
6084,"Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance ."
6085,The financial - services industry was battered by the 1987 crash .
6086,"What 's more , although the stock market is far less overvalued today than two years ago , the U.S. economy is weaker ."
6087,Growth is slower .
6088,Profits are softer .
6089,Debt burdens are heavier .
6090,"But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate ."
6091,"The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets ."
6092,Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest - rate policies .
6093,But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short - term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
6094,"Anticipating the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625 % late Friday , down from 8.820 % the day before ."
6095,"Tiny movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets ."
6096,The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the U.S. .
6097,"Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years ."
6098,The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar .
6099,"A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the U.S. ."
6100,"That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. ."
6101,Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so comforting .
6102,"In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation - adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % ."
6103,"The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989 , which ended two weeks ago ."
6104,"The plunge in stock prices `` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , '' says economist Lawrence Chimerine of WEFA Group , a Bala Cynwyd , Pa. , forecasting company ."
6105,`` A lot of pent - up demand is gone . ''
6106,"Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls Mr. Zarnowitz , a longtime student of business cycles ."
6107,`` That was offset by strength elsewhere .
6108,-LCB- The effects -RCB- were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected .
6109,"'' Today , he frets , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers retrench in reaction ."
6110,"What 's more , the corporate borrowing binge has n't abated in the past two years ."
6111,"`` We 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt ... just at the time when earnings are being squeezed , '' Mr. Chimerine notes ."
6112,"The more a company relies on borrowed money , the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown ."
6113,A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm ; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court .
6114,"The Fed , of course , knows that very well -- hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning ."
6115,"But , in the process , the Fed risks reigniting inflation ."
6116,"Even before Friday 's events , Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations ."
6117,"The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons ; it 's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation ."
6118,"In the end , the 1987 collapse suggested , the economy does n't move in lockstep with stock prices ."
6119,"The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors ."
6120,A panic on Wall Street does n't exactly inspire confidence .
6121,Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday .
6122,"A 190 - point drop is n't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will ."
6123,"If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs , Va. , for the Business Council meetings are typical , business leaders were n't overly rattled by Friday 's decline ."
6124,"And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it ."
6125,"On the bottom line , the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before ."
6126,"Two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression ."
6127,The doomsayers had a receptive audience .
6128,The prosperity that followed Black Monday permits a more optimistic view today .
6129,"At the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last go - around ."
6130,"As Sen. Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- observed yesterday , `` The Fed avoided a meltdown last time ."
6131,They are more sophisticated this time .

6160,"Currently , foreign funded enterprises in Gansu Province no longer worry about investment risk ."
6161,"To ensure that the opening up to the outside world can be implemented smoothly , during the "" eighth five - year plan "" period -LRB- 1991 to 1995 -RRB- , Gansu Province 's foreign affairs insurance industry developed rapidly , and it has already provided an accumulated sum of 61.1 billion yuan in terms of risk safeguard ."
6162,"Insurance coverages include the four large categories of property , liability , credit and life , with more than sixty primary and secondary risk types ."
6163,"According to presentations from concerned departments in Gansu Province , since the "" eighth five - year plan "" , Gansu Province has used foreign investments to vigorously develop ."
6164,"On the basis of meeting the needs of economic development and overseas investors , the Gansu provincial branch of the People 's Insurance Company of China Group caters to foreign businessmen 's requirements , providing whole - process insurance which extends from the import of equipment to its transportation , and from installation to the formation of fixed assets , thus helping foreign businessmen to set their minds at ease ."
6165,"Conventional insurance lines such as transportation insurance , property insurance , automobile insurance , etc. are specially offered to foreign funded enterprises such as the Zhengda Company and the Huaxing Aluminum Firm , etc. and new types of insurance such as employer liability insurance , investment insurance , and profit - loss insurance , etc. are also offered at the appropriate time , satisfying the investment needs of foreign businessmen , bringing the insurance rate of the foreign business invested enterprises to more than 90 percent ."

6360,"Mingquan Zhang , vice director of Shandong Province 's Foreign Economy and Trade Committee , said that in 1997 , the quality and level of Shandong 's utilizing foreign capital had further improved ."

6388,"In 1997 , Mexico 's total amount of foreign trade broke through 220 billion US dollars , which created a new historical record ."
6389,"However , in reviewing Mexico 's foreign trade situation this year , it might be appropriate to say that it is between joy and sorrow ."
6390,"The joy lies in that the total amount of foreign trade still maintains a strong growth momentum , and has realized trade surpluses for the third year in a row , whereas the sorrow is that the amount of trade surplus has sharply reversed , and this year , a relatively large deficit may appear ."
6391,"According to official journals published recently by Mexico 's Treasury Department , Mexico 's foreign trade in 1997 continued to grow rapidly , the total amount of imports and exports reached 220.178 billion US dollars , 18.85 % higher than that of the previous year , and within that the amount of exports was 110.380 billion US dollars , the amount of imports was 109.798 billion US dollars , 15 % and 22.7 % higher than 1996 , respectively ."
6392,The trade surplus was 582 million US dollars .
6393,Foreign trade occupies a pivotal position in Mexico 's economy .
6394,"At present , exports account for more than 30 % of its GDP , which is one of the primary economic growth forces ."
6395,"After the outbreak of Mexico 's financial crisis in 1994 , Mexico 's currency , the peso was greatly devalued , thus greatly strengthening Mexico 's export competitiveness ."
6396,"In the last several years , the government has been vigorously supporting exports , and exports grew rapidly ."
6397,"In 1995 , the situation of successive foreign trade deficit reversed , and up to now , has maintained trade surpluses for three years in a row ."
6398,"However , in the past three years , Mexico 's foreign trade surplus showed a substantial degradation : 7.889 billion US dollars in 1995 , 6.424 billion US dollars in 1996 , and only 582 million US dollars last year ."
6399,"Especially deserving to be pointed out is that , after the first monthly deficit in July last year , the rest of the year saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling , roaring from 20 million US dollars in July to 722 million US dollars in December , reducing the 1997 annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number ."
6400,"Local economic analysts felt that the trade deficit in the second half of last year was mainly due to an overly high import growth rate , which is even higher than that of exports ."
6401,"In the second half of last year , the average growth rate of imports was 6 % to 7 % higher than that of exports ."
6402,"Among import sectors , swift growth comes mainly from imports of consumer products and capital goods , 39.9 % and 38.2 % higher than that of 1996 respectively ."
6403,The growth of imports of semi-finished products was up by 18.8 % .
6404,"Secondly , the overly high valuation of the peso is also an indispensable factor ."
6405,"An overly high peso exchange rate stimulated imports , but hindered exports ."
6406,"It is commonly known that in 1994 , before the outbreak of the financial crisis , the trade deficit was once as high as more than 18 billion US dollars ."
6407,The huge trade deficit was one of the internal reasons that triggered this crisis .
6408,"Hence , the trade situation last year has caused extreme concern among people from economic circles , who even predicted that in 1998 , foreign trade deficit would revive ."
6409,"They pointed out that , this year , except for an overly high peso exchange rate , exports would also face some new unfavorable factors ."
6410,"For instance , Asian currency devaluation will decrease export competitiveness , and the fall of oil price will significantly reduce oil revenues ."
6411,"Under these circumstances , if the import growth momentum can not be restrained , this year , a trade deficit of 4 to 5 billion US dollars may appear ."

6548,"In the past two years , Guangdong Province has exerted itself to explore new ways of attracting talent under market economy conditions , and has been active in using market mechanisms to allocate resources of talent , and has achieved preliminary results ."
6549,""" Taking the first step "" in Guangdong 's reform and opening up in the 1980's was closely related to the situation at that time of the "" Peafowl Flying Towards the Southeast "" -LRB- human talents from all over , one after another , going to Guangdong -RRB- ."
6550,"With the overall opening up of China 's coastal areas , frontier areas , riverside areas and capital cities of every province since the 1990's , the flow of talent tends to be multi-directional and the competition has become increasingly fierce ."
6551,Further enhancing the attraction to talented persons has become the key point of Guangdong 's further development .
6552,"Limo Qin , director of the Talent Exchange and Service Center of Guangdong Province has done analysis and said : "" the economic development rate of Guangdong in 1993 was at an intermediate level of that in the recent years ."
6553,"In that year it introduced more than 100,000 talented persons of various types ."
6554,"Developing at this rate , in the next ten years , not including graduates from higher education institutes , Guangdong 's talent gap is conservatively estimated to surpass 1 million ."
6555,"Therefore , further opening minds and introducing talent are guidelines of Guangdong 's policy regarding talented people . """
6556,"In recent years , there have been more and more climaxes in Guangdong 's talent market ."
6557,"Each year , there are several large - scale talent employment fairs whose service for more than 1000 employers and more than 10,000 applicants lasts for more than half a month ."
6558,"In the whole year of 1993 , talent exchange centers of personnel departments across the province registered more than 463,000 people applying for jobs ."
6559,"There were 62,000 people with documents of transfer or employment processed , of which 45.8 % had intermediate or advanced level titles of specialty or profession , and 78 % had an undergraduate or higher degree ."
6560,Talent introduction departments also actively went out visiting science and technology management talent .
6561,"Fourteen cities such as Guangzhou , Shenzhen , etc. went to Beijing for the first national talent and technology exchange fair , where they established a total of 100 employment booths ."
6562,"At the beginning of 1993 , six cities such as Zhuhai , Foshan , etc. also organized a delegation to advertise in the US and Canada for students studying abroad ."
6563,"1006 students abroad filled out application forms , and quite a number of people have successively returned to China to take jobs ."
6564,"At the same time , the construction of talent market is also accelerating ."
6565,"Since 1991 when Shenzhen established the first standing talent market , such "" all - weather "" talent exchange organizations have rapidly spread in the Zhujiang Delta and all cities within the province ."
6566,"Now , there are fifteen cities with relatively more advanced economies in the province having built up regular markets ."
6567,"In order to further enhance the attraction of talent , to break through the barrier of "" departmental ownership "" of talent , and to promote the flow of talent by forming mechanisms of independent employment and job choice , Guangdong Province has also paid greater attention to the formulation of relevant policies and regulations ."
6568,"Limo Qin said in his introduction that in recent years the provincial government has successively issued documents such as "" Temporary regulations on encouraging persons studying abroad to work in Guangdong "" , "" Notices on better advertising for talent "" , etc ."
6569,"It will soon promulgate documents such as "" Detailed rules for implementing temporary regulations on resignations of specialists , technicians and managers in state - owned units "" and "" Supplementary regulations of Guangdong Province on the management of Chinese side cadres in foreign investment enterprises "" , etc ."
6570,"Additionally , some new methods in inviting and managing talent have been being tried in various regions ."

6574,"A reporter asked : the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress had passed a resolution regarding "" the three - tiered administrative system of Hong Kong will operate until June 30th , 1997 , and then cease . "" ;"
6575,"Then , what will the three - level Chinese restructured administrative system be like ?"
6576,And when does the Chinese side plan to set about preparing to construct this system ?
6577,"Guofang Shen said that the HK - UK three - level administrative system , namely the last HK - UK legislative council , the two municipal departments , and the district parliament will only exist till June 30th , 1997 ."
6578,This is the inevitable outcome of the UK terminating its rule over Hong Kong at the designated time .
6579,He said that the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 's first legislative assembly and regional organizations will be formed according to the Basic Law and relevant resolutions of the National People 's Congress .
6580,"Currently , the Preparatory Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is studying relevant specific issues on forming the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 's first legislative assembly , and will submit suggestions to the Preparatory Committee that will be established in 1996 ."
6581,"A reporter asked : on August 23rd , the US president signed the "" 1995 financial year overseas activities fund appropriation act "" in which it is stipulated that any donation made by the US to the UN population fund must not be used in China ."
6582,What is your opinion of this ?
6583,Guofang Shen said that this bill is a bill carrying political discrimination and extremely unfriendly to China .
6584,"It is an insult to China 's family planning policy , has seriously violated the mission and principles of the UN charter , and sets a very bad precedent for the provision of aid to multi-lateral organizations of the UN ."
6585,"He pointed out that "" we resolutely oppose any country providing donations with attached conditions to the population fund ."
6586,"We do not hope to see the work of the UN population fund receiving interference or even being diverted from its principles and mission due to pressure from the US . """

6639,"The China 's handicapped sports cause has undergone the several stages of conceptualization , growth and expansion , and is currently rising ."
6640,The holding of the 6th Far East and South Pacific Disabled Games will provide more impetus for this trend .
6641,Each development step of handicapped sports can not be separated from the concern and support of the Party and the government .
6642,"At the beginning of the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , social welfare services and schools for blind children and deaf people were established successively everywhere ."
6643,"Welfare factories developed activities such as broadcast exercises , etc. and schools established physical education ."
6644,"As a part of the cause for the disabled , disabled sports began to grow ."
6645,"Every year , the nation allocates special funds to be used in developing handicapped sports activities ."
6646,Nationwide handicapped sports games began to be held in the late 1950's .
6647,The games accelerated improvement and drove popularization .
6648,The handicapped sports cause has gradually grown .
6649,"Since the reform and opening up , the Chinese economy has developed rapidly ."
6650,This enabled more people to put money and material resource into the disabled sports cause .
6651,"In the short 10 years , the cause has achieved success of attention from China and abroad ."
6652,It is reasonable to believe that the disabled cause will be increasingly recognized and supported as China 's overall national strength escalates .
6653,The handicapped sports cause will also have broad development .
6654,The establishment and healthiness of disabled sports organizations provide organizational assurance for the development of the sports cause for handicapped people .
6655,"The Chinese Injured and Disabled People Sports Association -LRB- renamed to the Chinese Disabled Sports Association in 1990 -RRB- was established in October , 1983 ."
6656,After this a succession of handicapped sports organizations were established throughout China .

6662,"The games have received more broad attention and support of the public , and have attracted more disabled people to take part in the events ."
6663,"Since 1984 the Chinese Disabled Sports Association has become a member of 8 international disabled sports organizations successively , such as the International Para Olympic Committee , etc. and has established relations with disabled sports organizations in various countries and areas and taken part in international events such as the Special Olympic Games , etc ."

6675,Jesus got into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town .
6676,Some people brought to him a man who was paralyzed and was lying on a mat .
6677,Jesus saw that these people had much faith .
6678,"So he said to the paralyzed man , `` Young man , you will be glad to hear this ."
6679,Your sins are forgiven . ''
6680,Some of the teachers of the law heard what Jesus said .
6681,"They said to themselves , `` What an insult to God for this man to say that ! ''"
6682,Jesus knew what they were thinking .
6683,"So he said , `` Why are you thinking such evil thoughts ?"
6684,The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins .
6685,But how can I prove this to you ?
6686,"Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say , ' Your sins are forgiven . '"
6687,There 's no proof that it really happened .
6688,"But what if I say to the man , ' Stand up and walk ' ?"
6689,Then you will be able to see that I really have this power . ''
6690,"So Jesus said to the paralyzed man , `` Stand up ."
6691,Take your mat and go home . ''
6692,The man stood up and went home .
6693,The people saw this and they were amazed .
6694,They praised God for letting someone have such power .
6695,"When Jesus was leaving , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the place for collecting taxes ."
6696,"Jesus said to him , `` Follow me . ''"
6697,So he got up and followed Jesus .
6698,Jesus ate dinner at Matthew 's house .
6699,Many tax collectors and others with bad reputations came and ate with him and his followers .
6700,The Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with these people .
6701,"They asked his followers , `` Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners ? ''"
6702,Jesus heard them say this .
6703,"So he said to them , `` It is the sick people who need a doctor , not those who are healthy ."
6704,You need to go and learn what this Scripture means : ' I do n't want animal sacrifices ; I want you to show kindness to people . '
6705,I did not come to invite good people .
6706,I came to invite sinners . ''
6707,"Then the followers of John came to Jesus and said , `` We and the Pharisees fast often , but your followers do n't ever fast ."
6708,Why ? ''
6709,"Jesus answered , `` At a wedding the friends of the bridegroom are not sad while he is with them ."
6710,They can not fast then .
6711,But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them .
6712,Then they will fast .
6713,"`` When someone sews a patch over a hole in an old coat , they never use a piece of cloth that has not already been shrunk ."
6714,"If they do , the patch will shrink and pull away from the coat ."
6715,Then the hole will be worse .
6716,"Also , people never pour new wine into old wineskins ."
6717,"They would break , the wine would spill out , and the wineskins would be ruined ."
6718,"People always put new wine into new wineskins , which wo n't break , and the wine stays good . ''"

6720,"The leader bowed down before him and said , `` My daughter has just died ."
6721,"But if you will come and touch her with your hand , she will live again . ''"
6722,So Jesus and his followers went with the man .
6723,"On the way , there was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years ."
6724,She came close behind Jesus and touched the bottom of his coat .
6725,"She was thinking , `` If I can touch his coat , I will be healed . ''"
6726,Jesus turned and saw the woman .
6727,"He said , `` Be happy , dear woman ."
6728,You are made well because you believed . ''
6729,Then the woman was healed .
6730,Jesus continued going with the Jewish leader and went into the leader 's house .
6731,He saw people there who make music for funerals .
6732,And he saw a crowd of people crying loudly .
6733,"Jesus said , `` Go away ."
6734,The girl is not dead .
6735,She is only sleeping . ''
6736,But the people laughed at him .
6737,"After the people were put out of the house , Jesus went into the girl 's room ."
6738,"He held the girl 's hand , and the girl stood up ."
6739,The news about this spread all around the area .
6740,"As Jesus was going away from there , two blind men followed him ."
6741,"They said loudly , `` Show kindness to us , Son of David . ''"
6742,"Jesus went inside , and the blind men went with him ."
6743,"He asked them , `` Do you believe that I am able to make you see again ? ''"
6744,"They answered , `` Yes , Lord , we believe . ''"
6745,"Then Jesus touched their eyes and said , `` You believe that I can make you see again , so it will happen . ''"
6746,Then the men were able to see .
6747,Jesus gave them a strong warning .
6748,"He said , `` Do n't tell anyone about this . ''"
6749,But they left and spread the news about Jesus all around that area .
6750,"As these two men were leaving , some people brought another man to Jesus ."
6751,This man could not talk because he had a demon inside him .
6752,"Jesus forced the demon out , and the man was able to talk ."
6753,"The people were amazed and said , `` We have never seen anything like this in Israel . ''"
6754,"But the Pharisees said , `` The ruler of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out . ''"
6755,Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages .
6756,He taught in their synagogues and told people the Good News about God 's kingdom .
6757,He healed all kinds of diseases and sicknesses .
6758,Jesus saw the many people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless -- like sheep without a shepherd to lead them .
6759,"Jesus said to his followers , `` There is such a big harvest of people to bring in ."
6760,But there are only a few workers to help harvest them .
6761,God owns the harvest .
6762,Ask him to send more workers to help gather his harvest . ''
6763,"After Jesus said all these things , he left Galilee ."
6764,He went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River .
6765,Many people followed him .
6766,Jesus healed the sick people there .
6767,Some Pharisees came to Jesus .
6768,They tried to make him say something wrong .
6769,"They asked him , `` Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for any reason he chooses ? ''"
6770,"Jesus answered , `` Surely you have read this in the Scriptures : When God made the world , ' he made people male and female . '"
6771,"And God said , ' That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife ."
6772,And the two people will become one . '
6773,"So they are no longer two , but one ."
6774,"God has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ''"
6775,"The Pharisees asked , `` Then why did Moses give a command allowing a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce ? ''"
6776,"Jesus answered , `` Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept God 's teaching ."
6777,But divorce was not allowed in the beginning .
6778,"I tell you that whoever divorces his wife , except for the problem of sexual sin , and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . ''"
6779,"The followers said to Jesus , `` If that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife , it is better not to marry . ''"
6780,"He answered , `` This statement is true for some , but not for everyone -- only for those who have been given this gift ."
6781,There are different reasons why some men do n't marry .
6782,Some were born without the ability to produce children .
6783,Others were made that way later in life .
6784,And others have given up marriage because of God 's kingdom .
6785,This is for anyone who is able to accept it . ''
6786,Then the people brought their little children to Jesus so that he could lay his hands on them to bless them and pray for them .
6787,"When the followers saw this , they told the people to stop bringing their children to him ."
6788,"But Jesus said , `` Let the little children come to me ."
6789,"Do n't stop them , because God 's kingdom belongs to people who are like these children . ''"
6790,"After Jesus blessed the children , he left there ."
6791,"A man came to Jesus and asked , `` Teacher , what good thing must I do to have eternal life ? ''"
6792,"Jesus answered , `` Why do you ask me about what is good ?"
6793,Only God is good .
6794,"But if you want to have eternal life , obey the law 's commands . ''"
6795,"The man asked , `` Which ones ? ''"
6796,"Jesus answered , `` ' You must not murder anyone , you must not commit adultery , you must not steal , you must not tell lies about others , you must respect your father and mother , ' and ' love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ' ''"
6797,"The young man said , `` I have obeyed all these commands ."
6798,What else do I need ? ''
6799,"Jesus answered , `` If you want to be perfect , then go and sell all that you own ."
6800,"Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven ."
6801,Then come and follow me ! ''
6802,"But when the young man heard Jesus tell him to give away his money , he was sad ."
6803,"He did n't want to do this , because he was very rich ."
6804,So he left .
6805,"Then Jesus said to his followers , `` The truth is , it will be very hard for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom ."
6806,"Yes , I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom . ''"
6807,The followers were amazed to hear this .
6808,"They asked , `` Then who can be saved ? ''"
6809,"Jesus looked at them and said , `` This is something that people can not do ."
6810,But God can do anything . ''
6811,"Peter said to him , `` We left everything we had and followed you ."
6812,So what will we have ? ''
6813,"Jesus said to them , `` When the time of the new world comes , the Son of Man will sit on his great and glorious throne ."
6814,"And I can promise that you who followed me will sit on twelve thrones , and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel ."
6815,"Everyone who has left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , children , or farms to follow me will get much more than they left ."
6816,And they will have eternal life .
6817,Many people who are first now will be last in the future .
6818,And many who are last now will be first in the future .
6819,"Then Jesus said , `` Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God 's kingdom come with power before you die . ''"
6820,"Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John and went up on a high mountain ."
6821,They were all alone there .
6822,"While these followers watched him , Jesus was changed ."
6823,His clothes became shining white -- whiter than anyone on earth could make them .
6824,Then two men were there talking with Jesus .
6825,They were Elijah and Moses .
6826,"Peter said to Jesus , `` Teacher , it is good that we are here ."
6827,"We will put three tents here -- one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ''"
6828,"Peter did not know what to say , because he and the other two followers were so afraid ."
6829,Then a cloud came and covered them .
6830,"A voice came from the cloud and said , `` This is my Son , the one I love ."
6831,Obey him ! ''
6832,"The followers looked , but they saw only Jesus there alone with them ."
6833,"As Jesus and the followers were walking back down the mountain , he gave them these instructions : `` Do n't tell anyone about what you saw on the mountain ."
6834,Wait until after the Son of Man rises from death .
6835,Then you can tell people what you saw . ''
6836,So the followers waited to say anything about what they saw .
6837,But they discussed among themselves what Jesus meant about rising from death .
6838,"They asked him , `` Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ''"
6839,"Jesus answered , `` They are right to say that Elijah must come first ."
6840,Elijah makes all things the way they should be .
6841,But why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man will suffer much and that people will think he is worth nothing ?
6842,I tell you that Elijah has already come .
6843,And people did to him all the bad things they wanted to do .
6844,The Scriptures said this would happen to him . ''
6845,"Then Jesus , Peter , James , and John went to the other followers ."
6846,They saw many people around them .
6847,The teachers of the law were arguing with the followers .
6848,"When the people saw Jesus , they were very surprised and ran to welcome him ."
6849,"Jesus asked , `` What are you arguing about with the teachers of the law ? ''"
6850,"A man answered , `` Teacher , I brought my son to you ."
6851,He is controlled by an evil spirit that keeps him from talking .
6852,The spirit attacks him and throws him on the ground .
6853,"He foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes very stiff ."
6854,"I asked your followers to force the evil spirit out , but they could not . ''"
6855,"Jesus answered , `` You people today do n't believe !"
6856,How long must I stay with you ?
6857,How long must I be patient with you ?
6858,Bring the boy to me ! ''
6859,So the followers brought the boy to Jesus .
6860,"When the evil spirit saw Jesus , it attacked the boy ."
6861,The boy fell down and rolled on the ground .
6862,He was foaming at the mouth .
6863,"Jesus asked the boy 's father , `` How long has this been happening to him ? ''"
6864,"The father answered , `` Since he was very young ."
6865,The spirit often throws him into a fire or into water to kill him .
6866,"If you can do anything , please have pity on us and help us . ''"
6867,"Jesus said to the father , `` Why did you say ' if you can ' ?"
6868,All things are possible for the one who believes . ''
6869,"Immediately the father shouted , `` I do believe ."
6870,Help me to believe more ! ''
6871,Jesus saw that all the people were running there to see what was happening .
6872,So he spoke to the evil spirit .
6873,"He said , `` You evil spirit that makes this boy deaf and stops him from talking -- I command you to come out of him and never enter him again ! ''"
6874,The evil spirit screamed .
6875,"It caused the boy to fall on the ground again , and then it came out ."
6876,The boy looked as if he was dead .
6877,"Many people said , `` He is dead ! ''"
6878,But Jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up .
6879,Then Jesus went into the house .
6880,His followers were alone with him there .
6881,"They said , `` Why were n't we able to force that evil spirit out ? ''"
6882,"Jesus answered , `` That kind of spirit can be forced out only with prayer . ''"
6883,Then Jesus and his followers left there and went through Galilee .
6884,Jesus did not want the people to know where they were .
6885,He wanted to teach his followers alone .
6886,"He said to them , `` The Son of Man will be handed over to the control of other men , who will kill him ."
6887,"After three days , he will rise from death . ''"
6888,"But the followers did not understand what he meant , and they were afraid to ask him ."
6889,Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum .
6890,"They went into a house , and Jesus said to them , `` I heard you arguing on the way here today ."
6891,What were you arguing about ? ''
6892,"But the followers did not answer , because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest ."
6893,Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him .
6894,"He said , `` Whoever wants to be the most important must make others more important than themselves ."
6895,They must serve everyone else . ''
6896,Then Jesus took a small child and stood the child in front of the followers .
6897,"He held the child in his arms and said , `` Whoever accepts children like these in my name is accepting me ."
6898,And anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . ''
6899,"Then John said , `` Teacher , we saw a man using your name to force demons out of someone ."
6900,He is not one of us .
6901,"So we told him to stop , because he does not belong to our group . ''"
6902,"Jesus said , `` Do n't stop him ."
6903,Whoever uses my name to do powerful things will not soon say bad things about me .
6904,Whoever is not against us is with us .
6905,I can assure you that anyone who helps you by giving you a drink of water because you belong to the Christ will definitely get a reward .
6906,"`` If one of these little children believes in me , and someone causes that child to sin , it will be very bad for that person ."
6907,It would be better for them to have a millstone tied around their neck and be drowned in the sea .
6908,"If your hand makes you sin , cut it off ."
6909,It is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two hands and go to hell .
6910,There the fire never stops .
6911,"If your foot makes you sin , cut it off ."
6912,It is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two feet and be thrown into hell .
6913,"If your eye makes you sin , take it out ."
6914,It is better for you to have only one eye and enter God 's kingdom than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell .
6915,The worms that eat the people in hell never die .
6916,The fire there is never stopped .
6917,`` Everyone will be salted with fire .
6918,`` Salt is good .
6919,"But if it loses its salty taste , you ca n't make it good again ."
6920,"So , do n't lose that good quality of salt you have ."
6921,And live in peace with each other . ''
6922,Jesus called his twelve apostles together .
6923,He gave them power to heal sicknesses and power to force demons out of people .
6924,He sent them to tell about God 's kingdom and to heal the sick .
6925,"He said to them , `` When you travel , do n't take a walking stick ."
6926,"Also , do n't carry a bag , food , or money ."
6927,Take for your trip only the clothes you are wearing .
6928,"When you go into a house , stay there until it is time to leave ."
6929,"If the people in the town will not welcome you , go outside the town and shake the dust off your feet as a warning to them . ''"
6930,So the apostles went out .
6931,They traveled through all the towns .
6932,They told the Good News and healed people everywhere .
6933,Herod the ruler heard about all these things that were happening .
6934,"He was confused because some people said , `` John the Baptizer has risen from death . ''"
6935,"Others said , `` Elijah has come to us . ''"
6936,"And some others said , `` One of the prophets from long ago has risen from death . ''"
6937,"Herod said , `` I cut off John 's head ."
6938,So who is this man I hear these things about ? ''
6939,Herod continued trying to see Jesus .
6940,"When the apostles came back , they told Jesus what they had done on their trip ."
6941,Then he took them away to a town called Bethsaida .
6942,"There , he and his apostles could be alone together ."
6943,But the people learned where Jesus went and followed him .
6944,He welcomed them and talked with them about God 's kingdom .
6945,He healed the people who were sick .
6946,"Late in the afternoon , the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said , `` No one lives in this place ."
6947,Send the people away .
6948,They need to find food and places to sleep in the farms and towns around here . ''
6949,"But Jesus said to the apostles , `` You give them something to eat . ''"
6950,"They said , `` We have only five loaves of bread and two fish ."
6951,Do you want us to go buy food for all these people ? ''
6952,There are too many !
6953,-LRB- There were about 5000 men there . -RRB-
6954,"Jesus said to his followers , `` Tell the people to sit in groups of about 50 people . ''"
6955,So the followers did this and everyone sat down .
6956,Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and two fish .
6957,He looked up into the sky and thanked God for the food .
6958,"Then he broke it into pieces , which he gave to the followers to give to the people ."
6959,They all ate until they were full .
6960,And there was a lot of food left .
6961,Twelve baskets were filled with the pieces of food that were not eaten .
6962,One time Jesus was praying alone .
6963,"His followers came together there , and he asked them , `` Who do the people say I am ? ''"
6964,"They answered , `` Some people say you are John the Baptizer ."
6965,Others say you are Elijah .
6966,And some people say you are one of the prophets from long ago that has come back to life . ''
6967,"Then Jesus said to his followers , `` And who do you say I am ? ''"
6968,"Peter answered , `` You are the Christ from God . ''"
6969,Jesus warned them not to tell anyone .
6970,"Then Jesus said , `` The Son of Man must suffer many things ."
6971,"He will be rejected by the older Jewish leaders , the leading priests , and teachers of the law ."
6972,And he will be killed .
6973,But after three days he will be raised from death . ''
6974,"Jesus continued to say to all of them , `` Any of you who want to be my follower must stop thinking about yourself and what you want ."
6975,You must be willing to carry the cross that is given to you every day for following me .
6976,Any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it .
6977,But you who give up your life for me will save it .
6978,It is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are destroyed or lost .
6979,Do n't be ashamed of me and my teaching .
6980,"If that happens , I will be ashamed of you when I come with my divine greatness and that of the Father and the holy angels ."
6981,Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God 's kingdom before you die . ''
6982,"About eight days after Jesus said these things , he took Peter , John , and James and went up on a mountain to pray ."
6983,"While Jesus was praying , his face began to change ."
6984,His clothes became shining white .
6985,"Then two men were there , talking with him ."
6986,They were Moses and Elijah .
6987,They also looked bright and glorious .
6988,They were talking with Jesus about his death that would happen in Jerusalem .
6989,Peter and the others were asleep .
6990,But they woke up and saw the glory of Jesus .
6991,They also saw the two men who were standing with him .
6992,"When Moses and Elijah were leaving , Peter said , ``"
6993,"Master , it is good that we are here ."
6994,"We will put three tents here -- one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ''"
6995,-LRB- He did not know what he was saying . -RRB-
6996,"While Peter was saying these things , a cloud came all around them ."
6997,"Peter , John , and James were afraid when the cloud covered them ."
6998,"A voice came from the cloud and said , `` This is my Son ."
6999,He is the one I have chosen .
7000,Obey him . ''
7001,"When the voice stopped , only Jesus was there ."
7002,"Peter , John , and James said nothing ."
7003,"And for a long time after that , they told no one about what they had seen ."
7004,"The next day , Jesus , Peter , John , and James came down from the mountain ."
7005,A large group of people met Jesus .
7006,"A man in the group shouted to him , `` Teacher , please come and look at my son ."
7007,He is the only child I have .
7008,"An evil spirit comes into him , and then he shouts ."
7009,He loses control of himself and foams at the mouth .
7010,The evil spirit continues to hurt him and almost never leaves him .
7011,"I begged your followers to make the evil spirit leave my son , but they could not do it . ''"
7012,"Jesus answered , `` You people today have no faith ."
7013,Your lives are all wrong .
7014,How long must I be with you and be patient with you ? ''
7015,"Then Jesus said to the man , `` Bring your son here . ''"
7016,"While the boy was coming , the demon threw the boy to the ground ."
7017,The boy lost control of himself .
7018,But Jesus gave a strong command to the evil spirit .
7019,"Then the boy was healed , and Jesus gave him back to his father ."
7020,All the people were amazed at the great power of God .
7021,The people were still amazed about all the things Jesus did .
7022,"He said to his followers , `` Do n't forget what I will tell you now : The Son of Man will soon be handed over to the control of other men . ''"
7023,But the followers did not understand what he meant .
7024,The meaning was hidden from them so that they could not understand it .
7025,But they were afraid to ask Jesus about what he said .
7026,Jesus ' followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest .
7027,"Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a little child and stood the child beside him ."
7028,"Then he said to the followers , `` Whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me ."
7029,And anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me .
7030,The one among you who is the most humble -- this is the one who is great . ''
7031,"John answered , `` Master , we saw someone using your name to force demons out of people ."
7032,We told him to stop because he does not belong to our group . ''
7033,"Jesus said to him , `` Do n't stop him ."
7034,Whoever is not against you is for you . ''
7035,The time was coming near when Jesus would leave and go back to heaven .
7036,He decided to go to Jerusalem .
7037,He sent some men ahead of him .
7038,They went into a town in Samaria to make everything ready for him .
7039,But the people there would not welcome Jesus because he was going toward Jerusalem .
7040,"James and John , the followers of Jesus , saw this ."
7041,"They said , `` Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven and destroy those people ? ''"
7042,But Jesus turned and criticized them for saying this .
7043,Then he and his followers went to another town .
7044,They were all traveling along the road .
7045,"Someone said to Jesus , `` I will follow you anywhere you go . ''"
7046,"He answered , `` The foxes have holes to live in ."
7047,The birds have nests .
7048,But the Son of Man has no place where he can rest his head . ''
7049,"Jesus said to another man , `` Follow me ! ''"
7050,"But the man said , `` Lord , let me go and bury my father first . ''"
7051,"But Jesus said to him , `` Let the people who are dead bury their own dead ."
7052,You must go and tell about God 's kingdom . ''
7053,"Another man said , `` I will follow you , Lord , but first let me go and say goodbye to my family . ''"
7054,"Jesus said , `` Anyone who begins to plow a field but looks back is not prepared for God 's kingdom . ''"
7055,Jesus was going through the city of Jericho .
7056,In Jericho there was a man named Zacchaeus .
7057,"He was a wealthy , very important tax collector ."
7058,He wanted to see who Jesus was .
7059,There were many others who wanted to see Jesus too .
7060,Zacchaeus was too short to see above the people .
7061,So he ran to a place where he knew Jesus would come .
7062,Then he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .
7063,"When Jesus came to where Zacchaeus was , he looked up and saw him in the tree ."
7064,"Jesus said , `` Zacchaeus , hurry !"
7065,Come down !
7066,I must stay at your house today . ''
7067,Zacchaeus hurried and came down .
7068,He was happy to have Jesus in his house .
7069,Everyone saw this .
7070,"They began to complain , `` Look at the kind of man Jesus is staying with ."
7071,Zacchaeus is a sinner ! ''
7072,"Zacchaeus said to the Lord , `` I want to do good ."
7073,I will give half of my money to the poor .
7074,"If I have cheated anyone , I will pay them back four times more . ''"
7075,"Jesus said , `` Today is the day for this family to be saved from sin ."
7076,"Yes , even this tax collector is one of God 's chosen people ."
7077,The Son of Man came to find lost people and save them . ''
7078,"As the crowd listened to what he was saying , Jesus went on to tell a story ."
7079,He was now near Jerusalem and knew that the people thought it was almost time for God 's kingdom to come .
7080,"So he said , `` A very important man was preparing to go to a country far away to be made a king ."
7081,Then he planned to return home and rule his people .
7082,So he called ten of his servants together .
7083,He gave a bag of money to each servant .
7084,"He said , ' Do business with this money until I come back . '"
7085,But the people in the kingdom hated the man .
7086,They sent a group to follow him to the other country .
7087,"There they said , ' We do n't want this man to be our king . '"
7088,`` But the man was made king .
7089,"When he came home , he said , ' Call those servants who have my money ."
7090,I want to know how much more money they earned with it . '
7091,"The first servant came and said , ' Sir , I earned ten bags of money with the one bag you gave me . '"
7092,"The king said to him , ' That 's great !"
7093,You are a good servant .
7094,I see that I can trust you with small things .
7095,So now I will let you rule over ten of my cities . '
7096,"`` The second servant said , ' Sir , with your one bag of money I earned five bags . '"
7097,"The king said to this servant , ' You can rule over five cities . '"
7098,"`` Then another servant came in and said to the king , ' Sir , here is your bag of money ."
7099,I wrapped it in a piece of cloth and hid it .
7100,I was afraid of you because you are a hard man .
7101,You even take money that you did n't earn and gather food that you did n't grow . '
7102,"`` Then the king said to him , ' What a bad servant you are !"
7103,I will use your own words to condemn you .
7104,You said that I am a hard man .
7105,You said that I even take money that I did n't earn and gather food that I did n't grow .
7106,"If that is true , you should have put my money in the bank ."
7107,"Then , when I came back , my money would have earned some interest . '"
7108,"Then the king said to the men who were watching , ' Take the bag of money away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten bags of money . '"
7109,"`` The men said to the king , ' But sir , that servant already has ten bags of money . '"
7110,"`` The king said , ' People who use what they have will get more ."
7111,But those who do not use what they have will have everything taken away from them .
7112,Now where are my enemies ?
7113,Where are the people who did not want me to be king ?
7114,Bring my enemies here and kill them .
7115,I will watch them die . ' ''
7116,"After Jesus said these things , he continued traveling toward Jerusalem ."
7117,"He came near Bethphage and Bethany , towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives ."
7118,He sent out two of his followers .
7119,"He said , `` Go into the town you can see there ."
7120,"When you enter the town , you will find a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden ."
7121,"Untie it , and bring it here to me ."
7122,"If anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey , you should say , ' The Master needs it . ' ''"
7123,The two followers went into town .
7124,They found the donkey exactly like Jesus told them .
7125,"They untied it , but its owners came out ."
7126,"They said to the followers , `` Why are you untying our donkey ? ''"
7127,"The followers answered , `` The Master needs it . ''"
7128,So the followers brought the donkey to Jesus .
7129,They put their coats on its back .
7130,Then they put Jesus on the donkey .
7131,He rode along the road toward Jerusalem .
7132,The followers spread their coats on the road before him .
7133,Jesus was coming close to Jerusalem .
7134,He was already near the bottom of the Mount of Olives .
7135,The whole group of followers was happy .
7136,They were very excited and praised God .
7137,They thanked God for all the powerful things they had seen .
7138,"They said , `` ' Welcome !"
7139,God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord . '
7140,Peace in heaven and glory to God ! ''
7141,"Some of the Pharisees said to Jesus , `` Teacher , tell your followers not to say these things . ''"
7142,"But Jesus answered , `` I tell you , if my followers did n't say them , these stones would shout them . ''"
7143,Jesus came near Jerusalem .
7144,"Looking at the city , he began to cry for it and said , `` I wish you knew today what would bring you peace ."
7145,But it is hidden from you now .
7146,A time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and hold you in on all sides .
7147,They will destroy you and all your people .
7148,Not one stone of your buildings will stay on top of another .
7149,All this will happen because you did not know the time when God came to save you . ''
7150,Jesus went into the Temple area .
7151,He began to throw out the people who were selling things there .
7152,"He said , `` The Scriptures say , ' My Temple will be a house of prayer . '"
7153,But you have changed it into a ' hiding place for thieves . ' ''
7154,Jesus taught the people in the Temple area every day .
7155,"The leading priests , the teachers of the law , and some of the leaders of the people wanted to kill him ."
7156,"But they did not know how they could do it , because everyone was listening to him ."
7157,The people were very interested in what Jesus said .
7158,"While Jesus was walking , he saw a man who had been blind since the time he was born ."
7159,"Jesus ' followers asked him , `` Teacher , why was this man born blind ?"
7160,Whose sin made it happen ?
7161,Was it his own sin or that of his parents ? ''
7162,"Jesus answered , `` It was not any sin of this man or his parents that caused him to be blind ."
7163,He was born blind so that he could be used to show what great things God can do .
7164,"While it is daytime , we must continue doing the work of the one who sent me ."
7165,"The night is coming , and no one can work at night ."
7166,"While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ''"
7167,"After Jesus said this , he spit on the dirt , made some mud and put it on the man 's eyes ."
7168,"Jesus told him , `` Go and wash in Siloam pool . ''"
7169,-LRB- Siloam means `` Sent . '' -RRB-
7170,"So the man went to the pool , washed and came back ."
7171,He was now able to see .
7172,"His neighbors and some others who had seen him begging said , `` Look !"
7173,Is this the same man who always sits and begs ? ''
7174,"Some people said , `` Yes !"
7175,He is the one . ''
7176,"But others said , `` No , he ca n't be the same man ."
7177,He only looks like him . ''
7178,"So the man himself said , `` I am that same man . ''"
7179,"They asked , `` What happened ?"
7180,How did you get your sight ? ''
7181,"He answered , `` The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes ."
7182,Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash .
7183,So I went there and washed .
7184,And then I could see . ''
7185,"They asked him , `` Where is this man ? ''"
7186,"He answered , `` I do n't know . ''"
7187,Then the people brought the man to the Pharisees .
7188,The day Jesus had made mud and healed the man 's eyes was a Sabbath day .
7189,"So the Pharisees asked the man , `` How did you get your sight ? ''"
7190,"He answered , `` He put mud on my eyes ."
7191,"I washed , and now I can see . ''"
7192,"Some of the Pharisees said , `` That man does not obey the law about the Sabbath day ."
7193,So he is not from God . ''
7194,"Others said , `` But someone who is a sinner can not do these miraculous signs . ''"
7195,So they could not agree with each other .
7196,"They asked the man again , `` Since it was your eyes he healed , what do you say about him ? ''"
7197,"He answered , `` He is a prophet . ''"
7198,The Jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man -- that he was blind and was now healed .
7199,But later they sent for his parents .
7200,"They asked them , `` Is this your son ?"
7201,You say he was born blind .
7202,So how can he see ? ''
7203,"His parents answered , `` We know that this man is our son ."
7204,And we know that he was born blind .
7205,But we do n't know why he can see now .
7206,We do n't know who healed his eyes .
7207,Ask him .
7208,He is old enough to answer for himself . ''
7209,They said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders .
7210,The leaders had already decided that they would punish anyone who said Jesus was the Christ .
7211,They would stop them from coming to the synagogue .
7212,"That is why his parents said , `` He is old enough ."
7213,Ask him . ''
7214,So the Jewish leaders called the man who had been blind .
7215,They told him to come in again .
7216,"They said , `` You should honor God by telling the truth ."
7217,We know that this man is a sinner . ''
7218,"The man answered , `` I do n't know if he is a sinner ."
7219,"But I do know this : I was blind , and now I can see . ''"
7220,"They asked , `` What did he do to you ?"
7221,How did he heal your eyes ? ''
7222,"He answered , `` I have already told you that ."
7223,But you would not listen to me .
7224,Why do you want to hear it again ?
7225,Do you want to be his followers too ? ''
7226,"At this they shouted insults at him and said , `` You are his follower , not us !"
7227,We are followers of Moses .
7228,We know that God spoke to Moses .
7229,But we do n't even know where this man comes from ! ''
7230,"The man answered , `` This is really strange !"
7231,"You do n't know where he comes from , but he healed my eyes ."
7232,"We all know that God does not listen to sinners , but he will listen to anyone who worships and obeys him ."
7233,This is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind .
7234,This man must be from God .
7235,"If he were not from God , he could not do anything like this . ''"
7236,"The Jewish leaders answered , `` You were born full of sin !"
7237,Are you trying to teach us ? ''
7238,And they told the man to get out of the synagogue and to stay out .
7239,"When Jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave , he found him and asked him , `` Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ''"
7240,"The man said , `` Tell me who he is , sir , so I can believe in him . ''"
7241,"Jesus said to him , `` You have already seen him ."
7242,The Son of Man is the one talking with you now . ''
7243,"The man answered , `` Yes , I believe , Lord ! ''"
7244,Then he bowed and worshiped Jesus .
7245,"Jesus said , `` I came into this world so that the world could be judged ."
7246,I came so that people who are blind could see .
7247,And I came so that people who think they see would become blind . ''
7248,Some of the Pharisees were near Jesus .
7249,They heard him say this .
7250,"They asked , `` What ?"
7251,Are you saying that we are blind too ? ''
7252,"Jesus said , `` If you were really blind , you would not be guilty of sin ."
7253,"But you say that you see , so you are still guilty . ''"
7254,Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be taken away and whipped .
7255,The soldiers made a crown from thorny branches and put it on his head .
7256,Then they put a purple robe around him .
7257,"They kept coming up to him and saying , `` Hail to the king of the Jews ! ''"
7258,And they hit him in the face .
7259,"Again Pilate came out and said to the Jewish leaders , `` Look !"
7260,I am bringing Jesus out to you .
7261,I want you to know that I find nothing I can charge him with . ''
7262,Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe .
7263,"Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is the man ! ''"
7264,"When the leading priests and the Jewish guards saw Jesus they shouted , `` Kill him on a cross !"
7265,Kill him on a cross ! ''
7266,"But Pilate answered , `` You take him and nail him to a cross yourselves ."
7267,I find nothing I can charge him with . ''
7268,"The Jewish leaders answered , `` We have a law that says he must die , because he said he is the Son of God . ''"
7269,"When Pilate heard this , he was more afraid ."
7270,"So he went back inside the palace and asked Jesus , `` Where are you from ? ''"
7271,But Jesus did not answer him .
7272,"Pilate said , `` You refuse to speak to me ?"
7273,"Remember , I have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross . ''"
7274,"Jesus answered , `` The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God ."
7275,So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin . ''
7276,"After this , Pilate tried to let Jesus go free ."
7277,"But the Jewish leaders shouted , `` Anyone who makes himself a king is against Caesar ."
7278,"So if you let this man go free , that means you are not Caesar 's friend . ''"
7279,"When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out to the place called `` The Stone Pavement . ''"
7280,-LRB- In Aramaic the name is Gabbatha . -RRB-
7281,Pilate sat down on the judge 's seat there .
7282,It was now almost noon on Preparation day of Passover week .
7283,"Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is your king ! ''"
7284,"They shouted , `` Take him away !"
7285,Take him away !
7286,Kill him on a cross ! ''
7287,"Pilate asked them , `` Do you want me to kill your king on a cross ? ''"
7288,"The leading priests answered , `` The only king we have is Caesar ! ''"
7289,So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be killed on a cross .
7290,The soldiers took Jesus .
7291,He carried his own cross to a place called `` The Place of the Skull . ''
7292,-LRB- In Aramaic the name of this place is `` Golgotha . '' -RRB-
7293,There they nailed Jesus to the cross .
7294,They also nailed two other men to crosses .
7295,They put them on each side of Jesus with him in the middle .
7296,Pilate told them to write a sign and put it on the cross .
7297,"The sign said , `` jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews . ''"
7298,"The sign was written in Aramaic , in Latin , and in Greek ."
7299,"Many of the Jews read this sign , because the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross was near the city ."
7300,"The leading Jewish priests said to Pilate , `` Do n't write , ' The King of the Jews . '"
7301,"But write , ' This man said , I am the King of the Jews . ' ''"
7302,"Pilate answered , `` I will not change what I have written . ''"
7303,"After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts ."
7304,Each soldier got one part .
7305,They also took his tunic .
7306,It was all one piece of cloth woven from top to bottom .
7307,"So the soldiers said to each other , `` We should not tear this into parts ."
7308,Let 's throw lots to see who will get it . ''
7309,"This happened to make clear the full meaning of what the Scriptures say : `` They divided my clothes among them , and they threw lots for what I was wearing . ''"
7310,So the soldiers did this .
7311,Jesus ' mother stood near his cross .
7312,"Her sister was also standing there with Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene ."
7313,Jesus saw his mother .
7314,He also saw the follower he loved very much standing there .
7315,"He said to his mother , `` Dear woman , here is your son . ''"
7316,"Then he said to the follower , `` Here is your mother . ''"
7317,"So after that , this follower took Jesus ' mother to live in his home ."
7318,"Later , Jesus knew that everything had been done ."
7319,"To make the Scriptures come true he said , `` I am thirsty . ''"
7320,"There was a jar full of sour wine there , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it ."
7321,They put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus ' mouth .
7322,"When he tasted the wine , he said , `` It is finished . ''"
7323,Then he bowed his head and died .
7324,This day was Preparation day .
7325,The next day was a special Sabbath day .
7326,The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day .
7327,So they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken .
7328,And they asked that the bodies be taken down from the crosses .
7329,So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men on the crosses beside Jesus .
7330,"But when the soldiers came close to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead ."
7331,So they did not break his legs .
7332,But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus '
7333,side .
7334,Immediately blood and water came out .
7335,-LRB- The one who saw this happen has told about it .
7336,He told about it so that you also can believe .
7337,The things he says are true .
7338,He knows that he tells the truth . -RRB-
7339,"These things happened to give full meaning to the Scriptures that said , `` None of his bones will be broken ''"
7340,and `` People will look at the one they stabbed . ''
7341,"Later , a man named Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus ."
7342,"-LRB- Joseph was a follower of Jesus , but he did not tell anyone , because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders . -RRB-"
7343,"Pilate said Joseph could take Jesus ' body , so he came and took it away ."
7344,Nicodemus went with Joseph .
7345,He was the man who had come to Jesus before and talked to him at night .
7346,He brought about 100 pounds of spices -- a mixture of myrrh and aloes .
7347,These two men took Jesus ' body and wrapped it in pieces of linen cloth with the spices .
7348,-LRB- This is how the Jews bury people . -RRB-
7349,"In the place where Jesus was killed on the cross , there was a garden ."
7350,In the garden there was a new tomb .
7351,No one had ever been buried there before .
7352,"The men put Jesus in that tomb because it was near , and the Jews were preparing to start their Sabbath day ."
7353,"In Jerusalem Saul was still trying to scare the followers of the Lord , even saying he would kill them ."
7354,He went to the high priest and asked him to write letters to the synagogues in the city of Damascus .
7355,Saul wanted the high priest to give him the authority to find people in Damascus who were followers of the Way .
7356,"If he found any believers there , men or women , he would arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem ."
7357,So Saul went to Damascus .
7358,"When he came near the city , a very bright light from heaven suddenly shined around him ."
7359,"He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , `` Saul , Saul !"
7360,Why are you persecuting me ? ''
7361,"Saul said , `` Who are you , Lord ? ''"
7362,"The voice answered , `` I am Jesus , the one you are persecuting ."
7363,Get up now and go into the city .
7364,Someone there will tell you what you must do . ''
7365,"The men traveling with Saul just stood there , unable to speak ."
7366,"They heard the voice , but they saw no one ."
7367,"Saul got up from the ground and opened his eyes , but he could not see ."
7368,So the men with him held his hand and led him into Damascus .
7369,For three days Saul could not see ; he did not eat or drink .
7370,There was a follower of Jesus in Damascus named Ananias .
7371,"In a vision the Lord said to him , `` Ananias ! ''"
7372,"Ananias answered , `` Here I am , Lord . ''"
7373,"The Lord said to him , `` Get up and go to the street called Straight Street ."
7374,Find the house of Judas and ask for a man named Saul from the city of Tarsus .
7375,"He is there now , praying ."
7376,He has seen a vision in which a man named Ananias came and laid his hands on him so that he could see again . ''
7377,"But Ananias answered , `` Lord , many people have told me about this man ."
7378,They told me about the many bad things he did to your holy people in Jerusalem .
7379,Now he has come here to Damascus .
7380,The leading priests have given him the power to arrest all people who trust in you . ''
7381,"But the Lord Jesus said to Ananias , `` Go !"
7382,I have chosen Saul for an important work .
7383,He must tell about me to other nations and their rulers and to the people of Israel .
7384,I will show him all that he must suffer for me . ''
7385,So Ananias left and went to the house of Judas .
7386,"He laid his hands on Saul and said , `` Saul , my brother , the Lord Jesus sent me ."
7387,He is the one you saw on the road when you came here .
7388,He sent me so that you can see again and also be filled with the Holy Spirit . ''
7389,"Immediately , something that looked like fish scales fell off Saul 's eyes ."
7390,He was able to see !
7391,Then he got up and was baptized .
7392,"After he ate , he began to feel strong again ."
7393,Saul stayed with the followers of Jesus in Damascus for a few days .
7394,Soon he began to go to the synagogues and tell people about Jesus .
7395,"He told the people , `` Jesus is the Son of God ! ''"
7396,All the people who heard Saul were amazed .
7397,"They said , `` This is the same man who was in Jerusalem trying to destroy the people who trust in Jesus !"
7398,And that 's why he has come here -- to arrest the followers of Jesus and take them back to the leading priests . ''
7399,But Saul became more and more powerful in proving that Jesus is the Christ .
7400,His proofs were so strong that the Jews who lived in Damascus could not argue with him .
7401,"After many days , some Jews made plans to kill Saul ."
7402,They were watching the city gates day and night .
7403,"They wanted to kill Saul , but he learned about their plan ."
7404,One night some followers that Saul had taught helped him leave the city .
7405,They put him in a basket and lowered it down through a hole in the city wall .
7406,Then Saul went to Jerusalem .
7407,"He tried to join the group of followers , but they were all afraid of him ."
7408,They did not believe that he was really a follower of Jesus .
7409,But Barnabas accepted Saul and took him to the apostles .
7410,He told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to Saul .
7411,Then he told them how boldly Saul had spoken for the Lord in Damascus .
7412,And so Saul stayed with the followers and went all around Jerusalem speaking boldly for the Lord .
7413,"He often had arguments with the Greek - speaking Jews , who began making plans to kill him ."
7414,"When the believers learned about this , they took Saul to Caesarea , and from there they sent him to the city of Tarsus ."
7415,"The church in Judea , Galilee , and Samaria had a time of peace ."
7416,"With the help of the Holy Spirit , the groups of believers became stronger and showed their respect for the Lord by the way they lived ."
7417,So the church everywhere grew in numbers .
7418,"Peter was traveling through all the areas around Jerusalem , and he stopped to visit the believers who lived in Lydda ."
7419,"There he met a man named Aeneas , who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for the past eight years ."
7420,"Peter said to him , `` Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you ."
7421,Get up and make your bed ! ''
7422,He stood up immediately .
7423,"All the people living in Lydda and on the plain of Sharon saw him , and they decided to follow the Lord ."
7424,In the city of Joppa there was a follower of Jesus named Tabitha .
7425,"Her Greek name , Dorcas , means `` a deer . ''"
7426,She was always doing good things for people and giving money to those in need .
7427,"While Peter was in Lydda , Tabitha became sick and died ."
7428,They washed her body and put it in an upstairs room .
7429,"The followers in Joppa heard that Peter was in Lydda , which was not far away ."
7430,"So they sent two men , who begged him , `` Hurry , please come quickly ! ''"
7431,Peter got ready and went with them .
7432,"When he arrived , they took him to the upstairs room ."
7433,All the widows stood around him .
7434,They were crying and showing him the coats and other clothes that Tabitha had made during her time with them .
7435,Peter sent all the people out of the room .
7436,He knelt down and prayed .
7437,"Then he turned to Tabitha 's body and said , `` Tabitha , stand up ! ''"
7438,She opened her eyes .
7439,"When she saw Peter , she sat up ."
7440,He gave her his hand and helped her stand up .
7441,Then he called the believers and the widows into the room .
7442,He showed them Tabitha ; she was alive !
7443,"People everywhere in Joppa learned about this , and many believed in the Lord ."
7444,"Peter stayed in Joppa for many days at the home of a man named Simon , who was a leatherworker ."
7445,"While Apollos was in the city of Corinth , Paul was visiting some places on his way to Ephesus ."
7446,In Ephesus he found some other followers of the Lord .
7447,"He asked them , `` Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? ''"
7448,"These followers said to him , `` We have never even heard of a Holy Spirit ! ''"
7449,"Paul asked them , `` So what kind of baptism did you have ? ''"
7450,"They said , `` It was the baptism that John taught . ''"
7451,"Paul said , `` John told people to be baptized to show they wanted to change their lives ."
7452,"He told people to believe in the one who would come after him , and that one is Jesus . ''"
7453,"When these followers heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus ."
7454,"Then Paul laid his hands on them , and the Holy Spirit came on them ."
7455,They began speaking different languages and prophesying .
7456,There were about twelve men in this group .
7457,Paul went into the synagogue and spoke very boldly .
7458,He continued doing this for three months .
7459,"He talked with the Jews , trying to persuade them to accept what he was telling them about God 's kingdom ."
7460,But some of them became stubborn and refused to believe .
7461,"In front of everyone , they said bad things about the Way ."
7462,So Paul left these Jews and took the Lord 's followers with him .
7463,He went to a place where a man named Tyrannus had a school .
7464,There Paul talked with people every day .
7465,He did this for two years .
7466,"Because of this work , everyone in Asia , Jews and Greeks , heard the word of the Lord ."
7467,God used Paul to do some very special miracles .
7468,Some people carried away handkerchiefs and clothes that Paul had used and put them on those who were sick .
7469,"The sick people were healed , and evil spirits left them ."
7470,Some Jews also were traveling around forcing evil spirits out of people .
7471,"The seven sons of Sceva , one of the leading priests , were doing this ."
7472,These Jews tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to make the evil spirits go out of people .
7473,"They all said , `` By the same Jesus that Paul talks about , I order you to come out ! ''"
7474,"But one time an evil spirit said to these Jews , `` I know Jesus , and I know about Paul , but who are you ? ''"
7475,Then the man who had the evil spirit inside him jumped on these Jews .
7476,He was much stronger than all of them .
7477,He beat them up and tore their clothes off .
7478,They all ran away from that house .
7479,"All the people in Ephesus , Jews and Greeks , learned about this ."
7480,They were all filled with fear and gave great honor to the Lord Jesus .
7481,"Many of the believers began to confess , telling about all the evil things they had done ."
7482,Some of them had used magic .
7483,These believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone .
7484,"These books were worth about 50 , 000 silver coins ."
7485,"This is how the word of the Lord was spreading in a powerful way , causing more and more people to believe ."
7486,"After this , Paul made plans to go to Jerusalem ."
7487,"He planned to go through the regions of Macedonia and Achaia , and then go to Jerusalem ."
7488,"He thought , `` After I visit Jerusalem , I must also visit Rome . ''"
7489,Timothy and Erastus were two of his helpers .
7490,Paul sent them ahead to Macedonia .
7491,But he stayed in Asia for a while .
7492,But during that time there was some trouble in Ephesus about the Way .
7493,This is how it all happened : There was a man named Demetrius .
7494,He worked with silver .
7495,He made little silver models that looked like the temple of the goddess Artemis .
7496,The men who did this work made a lot of money .
7497,Demetrius had a meeting with these men and some others who did the same kind of work .
7498,"He told them , `` Men , you know that we make a lot of money from our business ."
7499,But look at what this man Paul is doing .
7500,Listen to what he is saying .
7501,He has convinced many people in Ephesus and all over Asia to change their religion .
7502,He says the gods that people make by hand are not real .
7503,I 'm afraid this is going to turn people against our business .
7504,But there is also another problem .
7505,People will begin to think that the temple of the great goddess Artemis is not important .
7506,Her greatness will be destroyed .
7507,And Artemis is the goddess that everyone in Asia and the whole world worships . ''
7508,"When the men heard this , they became very angry ."
7509,"They shouted , `` Great is Artemis , the goddess of Ephesus ! ''"
7510,The whole city was thrown into confusion .
7511,"The people grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus , men from Macedonia who were traveling with Paul , and rushed all together into the stadium ."
7512,"Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people , but the Lord 's followers did not let him go ."
7513,"Also , some leaders of the country who were friends of Paul sent him a message telling him not to go into the stadium ."
7514,Some people were shouting one thing and others were shouting something else .
7515,The meeting was very confused .
7516,Most of the people did not know why they had come there .
7517,"Some Jews made a man named Alexander stand before the crowd , and they told him what to say ."
7518,"Alexander waved his hand , trying to explain things to the people ."
7519,"But when the people saw that Alexander was a Jew , they all began shouting the same thing ."
7520,"For two hours they continued shouting , `` Great is Artemis of Ephesus !"
7521,Great is Artemis of Ephesus !
7522,Great is Artemis . . . ! ''
7523,Then the city clerk persuaded the people to be quiet .
7524,"He said , `` Men of Ephesus , everyone knows that Ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess Artemis ."
7525,Everyone knows that we also keep her holy rock .
7526,"No one can deny this , so you should be quiet ."
7527,You must stop and think before you do anything else .
7528,"`` You brought these men here , but they have not said anything bad against our goddess ."
7529,They have not stolen anything from her temple .
7530,We have courts of law and there are judges .
7531,Do Demetrius and those men who work with him have a charge against anyone ?
7532,They should go to the courts .
7533,Let them argue with each other there .
7534,`` Is there something else you want to talk about ?
7535,Then come to the regular town meeting of the people .
7536,It can be decided there .
7537,I say this because someone might see this trouble today and say we are rioting .
7538,"We could not explain all this trouble , because there is no real reason for this meeting . ''"
7539,"After the city clerk said this , he told the people to go home ."
7540,I am in Christ and I am telling you the truth .
7541,I am not lying .
7542,"And my conscience , ruled by the Holy Spirit , agrees that what I say now is true ."
7543,I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness for my own people .
7544,"They are my brothers and sisters , my earthly family ."
7545,I wish I could help them .
7546,I would even have a curse on me and cut myself off from Christ if that would help them .
7547,"They are the people of Israel , God 's chosen children ."
7548,They have the glory of God and the agreements he made between himself and his people .
7549,"God gave them the Law of Moses , the Temple worship , and his promises ."
7550,"They are the descendants of our great fathers , and they are the earthly family of Christ ."
7551,And Christ is God over all things .
7552,Praise him forever !
7553,Amen .
7554,I do n't mean that God failed to keep his promise to the Jewish people .
7555,But only some of the people of Israel are really God 's people .
7556,And only some of Abraham 's descendants are true children of Abraham .
7557,This is what God said to Abraham : `` Your true descendants will be those who come through Isaac . ''
7558,This means that not all of Abraham 's descendants are God 's true children .
7559,Abraham 's true children are those who become God 's children because of the promise he made to Abraham .
7560,"Here is what God said in that promise : `` About this time next year I will come back , and Sarah will have a son . ''"
7561,And that is not all .
7562,"Rebecca also had sons , and they had the same father ."
7563,He is our father Isaac .
7564,"But before the two sons were born , God told Rebecca , `` The older son will serve the younger . ''"
7565,This was before the boys had done anything good or bad .
7566,God said this before they were born so that the boy he wanted would be chosen because of God 's own plan .
7567,"He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call , not because of anything the boys did ."
7568,"As the Scriptures say , `` I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau . ''"
7569,So what does this mean ?
7570,That God is not fair ?
7571,We can not say that .
7572,"God said to Moses , `` I will show mercy to anyone I want to show mercy to ."
7573,I will show pity to anyone I choose . ''
7574,"So God will choose anyone he decides to show mercy to , and his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do ."
7575,In the Scriptures God says to Pharaoh : `` I made you king so that you could do this for me .
7576,I wanted to show my power through you .
7577,I wanted my name to be announced throughout the world . ''
7578,So God shows mercy to those he wants to show mercy to and makes stubborn those he wants to make stubborn .
7579,"So one of you will ask me , `` If God controls what we do , why does he blame us for our sins ? ''"
7580,Do n't ask that .
7581,You are only human and have no right to question God .
7582,A clay jar does not question the one who made it .
7583,"It does not say , `` Why did you make me like this ? ''"
7584,The one who makes the jar can make anything he wants .
7585,He uses the same clay to make different things .
7586,He might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use .
7587,It is the same way with what God has done .
7588,He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power .
7589,But he patiently endured those he was angry with -- people who were ready to be destroyed .
7590,He waited with patience so that he could make known the riches of his glory to the people he has chosen to receive his mercy .
7591,God has already prepared them to share his glory .
7592,"We are those people , the ones God chose not only from the Jews but also from those who are not Jews ."
7593,"As the Scriptures say in the book of Hosea , `` The people who are not mine -- I will say they are my people ."
7594,And the people I did not love -- I will say they are the people I love . ''
7595,"And , `` Where God said in the past , ' You are not my people ' -- there they will be called children of the living God . ''"
7596,"And Isaiah cries out about Israel : `` There are so many people of Israel , they are like the grains of sand by the sea ."
7597,But only a few of them will be saved .
7598,"Yes , the Lord will quickly finish judging the people on the earth . ''"
7599,It is just as Isaiah said : `` The Lord All - Powerful allowed some of our people to live .
7600,"If he had not done that , we would now be like Sodom , and we would be like Gomorrah . ''"
7601,So what does all this mean ?
7602,"It means that people who are not Jews were made right with God because of their faith , even though they were not trying to make themselves right ."
7603,"And the people of Israel , who tried to make themselves right with God by following the law , did not succeed ."
7604,They failed because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did .
7605,They did not trust in God to make them right .
7606,They fell over the stone that makes people fall .
7607,"The Scriptures talk about that stone : `` Look , I put in Zion a stone that will make people stumble ."
7608,It is a rock that will make people fall .
7609,But anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed . ''
7610,I am a free man .
7611,I am an apostle .
7612,I have seen Jesus our Lord .
7613,You people are an example of my work in the Lord .
7614,"Others may not accept me as an apostle , but surely you do ."
7615,You are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord .
7616,Some people want to judge me .
7617,"So this is the answer I give them : We have the right to eat and drink , do n't we ?"
7618,"We have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel , do n't we ?"
7619,The other apostles and the Lord 's brothers and Peter all do this .
7620,And are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living ?
7621,No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary .
7622,No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself .
7623,No one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself .
7624,These are n't just my own thoughts .
7625,God 's law says the same thing .
7626,"Yes , it is written in the Law of Moses : ``"
7627,"When a work animal is being used to separate grain , do n't keep it from eating the grain . ''"
7628,"When God said this , was he thinking only about work animals ?"
7629,No .
7630,He was really talking about us .
7631,"Yes , that was written for us ."
7632,The one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work .
7633,"We planted spiritual seed among you , so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life ."
7634,Surely that is not asking too much .
7635,Others have this right to get things from you .
7636,So surely we have this right too .
7637,But we do n't use this right .
7638,"No , we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the Good News of Christ ."
7639,Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple .
7640,And those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar .
7641,It is the same with those who have the work of telling the Good News .
7642,The Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work .
7643,"But I have not used any of these rights , and I am not trying to get anything from you ."
7644,That is not my purpose for writing this .
7645,I would rather die than to have someone take away what for me is a great source of pride .
7646,It 's not my work of telling the Good News that gives me any reason to boast .
7647,That is my duty -- something I must do .
7648,"If I do n't tell people the Good News , I am in real trouble ."
7649,"If I did it because it was my own choice , I would deserve to be paid ."
7650,But I have no choice .
7651,I must tell the Good News .
7652,So I am only doing the duty that was given to me .
7653,So what do I get for doing it ?
7654,My reward is that when I tell people the Good News I can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work .
7655,I am free .
7656,"I belong to no other person , but I make myself a slave to everyone ."
7657,I do this to help save as many people as I can .
7658,To the Jews I became like a Jew so that I could help save Jews .
7659,"I myself am not ruled by the law , but to those who are ruled by the law I became like someone who is ruled by the law ."
7660,I did this to help save those who are ruled by the law .
7661,To those who are without the law I became like someone who is without the law .
7662,I did this to help save those who are without the law .
7663,"-LRB- But really , I am not without God 's law -- I am ruled by the law of Christ . -RRB-"
7664,"To those who are weak , I became weak so that I could help save them ."
7665,I have become all things to all people .
7666,I did this so that I could save people in any way possible .
7667,I do all this to make the Good News known .
7668,I do it so that I can share in the blessings of the Good News .
7669,"You know that in a race all the runners run , but only one runner gets the prize ."
7670,So run like that .
7671,Run to win !
7672,All who compete in the games use strict training .
7673,They do this so that they can win a prize -- one that does n't last .
7674,But our prize is one that will last forever .
7675,So I run like someone who has a goal .
7676,"I fight like a boxer who is hitting something , not just the air ."
7677,It is my own body I fight to make it do what I want .
7678,I do this so that I wo n't miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it .
7679,I really do n't need to write to you about this help for God 's people .
7680,I know that you want to help .
7681,I have been bragging about you to the people in Macedonia .
7682,I told them that you people in Achaia have been ready to give since last year .
7683,And your desire to give has made most of the people here ready to give also .
7684,But I am sending the brothers to you .
7685,I do n't want our bragging about you in this to be for nothing .
7686,I want you to be ready just as I said you would be .
7687,"If any of those from Macedonia come with me , and they find that you are not ready , we will be ashamed ."
7688,We will be ashamed that we were so sure of you .
7689,And you will be ashamed too !
7690,So I thought that I should ask these brothers to come there before we do .
7691,They will help in getting together the generous gift you promised .
7692,"Then it will be ready when we come , and it will be seen as a blessing you are giving , not as something you were forced to do ."
7693,Remember this : The one who plants few seeds will have a small harvest .
7694,But the one who plants a lot will have a big harvest .
7695,Each one of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give .
7696,You should not give if it makes you unhappy or if you feel forced to give .
7697,God loves those who are happy to give .
7698,"And God can give you more blessings than you need , and you will always have plenty of everything ."
7699,You will have enough to give to every good work .
7700,"As the Scriptures say , `` He gives generously to the poor ; his goodness will continue forever . ''"
7701,"God is the one who gives seed to those who plant , and he gives bread for food ."
7702,And God will give you spiritual seed and make that seed grow .
7703,He will produce a great harvest from your goodness .
7704,God will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely .
7705,And your giving through us will make people give thanks to God .
7706,"The service you are offering helps God 's people with their needs , but that is not all it does ."
7707,It is also bringing more and more thanks to God .
7708,"This service is a proof of your faith , and people will praise God because of it ."
7709,They will praise him because you are following the message about Christ -- the message you say you believe .
7710,They will praise God because you freely share with them and with all people .
7711,"And when they pray , they will wish they could be with you ."
7712,They will feel this way because of the great grace that God gave you .
7713,Thanks be to God for his gift that is too wonderful to describe .
7714,The first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth .
7715,This place was inside a tent .
7716,The first area in the tent was called the Holy Place .
7717,In the Holy Place were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to God .
7718,Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place .
7719,In the Most Holy Place was a golden altar for burning incense .
7720,And also there was the Box of the Agreement .
7721,The Box was covered with gold .
7722,Inside this Box was a golden jar of manna and Aaron 's rod -- the rod that once grew leaves .
7723,Also in the Box were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments of the old agreement on them .
7724,Above the Box were the Cherub angels that showed God 's glory .
7725,These Cherub angels were over the place of mercy .
7726,But we can not say everything about this now .
7727,Everything in the tent was made ready in the way I have explained .
7728,Then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties .
7729,"But only the high priest could go into the second room , and he went in only once a year ."
7730,"Also , he could never enter that room without taking blood with him ."
7731,He offered that blood to God for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinning .
7732,The Holy Spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the first room was still there .
7733,This is an example for us today .
7734,It shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to God are not able to make the consciences of the worshipers completely clear .
7735,These gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washings .
7736,They are only rules about the body .
7737,God gave them for his people to follow until the time of his new way .
7738,But Christ has already come to be the high priest .
7739,He is the high priest of the good things we now have .
7740,But Christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in .
7741,He serves in a better place .
7742,"Unlike that tent , this one is perfect ."
7743,It was not made by anyone here on earth .
7744,It does not belong to this world .
7745,Christ entered the Most Holy Place only one time -- enough for all time .
7746,"He entered the Most Holy Place by using his own blood , not the blood of goats or young bulls ."
7747,He entered there and made us free from sin forever .
7748,The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sprinkled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship .
7749,The blood and ashes made them pure again -- but only their bodies .
7750,So surely the blood sacrifice of Christ can do much more .
7751,Christ offered himself through the eternal Spirit as a perfect sacrifice to God .
7752,His blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done .
7753,It will give us clear consciences so that we can worship the living God .
7754,So Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people .
7755,"He brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by God can have the blessings God promised , blessings that last forever ."
7756,This can happen only because Christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement .
7757,"When someone dies and leaves a will , there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead ."
7758,A will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living .
7759,It can be used only after that person 's death .
7760,That is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between God and his people .
7761,"First , Moses told the people every command in the law ."
7762,Then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water .
7763,He used red wool and a branch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people .
7764,"Then he said , `` This is the blood that makes the agreement good -- the agreement that God commanded you to follow . ''"
7765,"In the same way , Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent ."
7766,He sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship .
7767,The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood .
7768,Sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice .
7769,These things are copies of the real things that are in heaven .
7770,These copies had to be made clean by animal sacrifices .
7771,But the real things in heaven must have much better sacrifices .
7772,Christ went into the Most Holy Place .
7773,"But it was not the man - made one , which is only a copy of the real one ."
7774,"He went into heaven , and he is there now before God to help us ."
7775,The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year .
7776,He takes with him blood to offer .
7777,But he does not offer his own blood like Christ did .
7778,"Christ went into heaven , but not to offer himself many times like the high priest offers blood again and again ."
7779,"If Christ had offered himself many times , he would have needed to suffer many times since the time the world was made ."
7780,But he came to offer himself only once .
7781,And that once is enough for all time .
7782,He came at a time when the world is nearing an end .
7783,He came to take away all sin by offering himself as a sacrifice .
7784,Everyone must die once .
7785,Then they are judged .
7786,So Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people .
7787,"And he will come a second time , but not to offer himself for sin ."
7788,He will come the second time to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him .
7789,The fifth angel blew his trumpet .
7790,Then I saw a star fall from the sky to the earth .
7791,The star was given the key to the deep hole that leads down to the bottomless pit .
7792,Then the star opened the hole leading to the pit .
7793,Smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace .
7794,The sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .
7795,Then locusts came out of the smoke and went down to the earth .
7796,They were given the power to sting like scorpions .
7797,They were told not to damage the fields of grass or any plant or tree .
7798,They were to hurt only those who did not have God 's mark on their foreheads .
7799,They were not given the power to kill them but only to cause them pain for five months -- pain like a person feels when stung by a scorpion .
7800,"During those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it ."
7801,"They will want to die , but death will hide from them ."
7802,The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle .
7803,On their heads they wore something that looked like a gold crown .
7804,Their faces looked like human faces .
7805,Their hair was like women 's hair .
7806,Their teeth were like lions ' teeth .
7807,Their chests looked like iron breastplates .
7808,The sound their wings made was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .
7809,The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions .
7810,The power they had to give people pain for five months was in their tails .
7811,"They had a ruler , who was the angel of the bottomless pit ."
7812,His name in Hebrew is Abaddon .
7813,In Greek it is Apollyon .
7814,The first terror is now past .
7815,There are still two other terrors to come .
7816,The sixth angel blew his trumpet .
7817,Then I heard a voice coming from the horns on the four corners of the golden altar that is before God .
7818,"It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , `` Free the four angels who are tied at the great river Euphrates . ''"
7819,These four angels had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year .
7820,The angels were set free to kill a third of all the people on the earth .
7821,I heard how many troops on horses were in their army .
7822,"There were 200 , 000 , 000 ."
7823,"In my vision , I saw the horses and the riders on the horses ."
7824,"They looked like this : They had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur ."
7825,The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions .
7826,"The horses had fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths ."
7827,"A third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues coming out of the horses ' mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur ."
7828,The horses ' power was in their mouths and also in their tails .
7829,Their tails were like snakes that have heads to bite and hurt people .
7830,The other people on earth were not killed by these plagues .
7831,But these people still did not change their hearts and turn away from worshiping the things they had made with their own hands .
7832,"They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood -- things that can not see or hear or walk ."
7833,"They did not change their hearts and turn away from killing other people or from their evil magic , their sexual sins , and their stealing ."
7834,After this I heard what sounded like a large crowd of people in heaven .
7835,"The people were saying , `` Hallelujah !"
7836,"Victory , glory , and power belong to our God ."
7837,His judgments are true and right .
7838,Our God has punished the prostitute .
7839,She is the one who ruined the earth with her sexual sin .
7840,God has punished the prostitute to pay her back for the death of his servants . ''
7841,"These people also said , `` Hallelujah !"
7842,She is burning and her smoke will rise forever and ever . ''
7843,Then the 24 elders and the four living beings bowed down .
7844,"They worshiped God , who sits on the throne ."
7845,"They said , `` Amen !"
7846,Hallelujah ! ''
7847,"Then a voice came from the throne and said , `` Praise our God , all you who serve him !"
7848,"Praise our God , all you small and great who honor him ! ''"
7849,Then I heard something that sounded like a large crowd of people .
7850,It was as loud as crashing waves or claps of thunder .
7851,"The people were saying , `` Hallelujah !"
7852,Our Lord God rules .
7853,He is the All - Powerful .
7854,Let us rejoice and be happy and give God glory !
7855,"Give God glory , because the wedding of the Lamb has come ."
7856,And the Lamb 's bride has made herself ready .
7857,Fine linen was given to the bride for her to wear .
7858,The linen was bright and clean . ''
7859,-LRB- The fine linen means the good things that God 's holy people did . -RRB-
7860,"Then the angel said to me , `` Write this : Great blessings belong to those who are invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb ! ''"
7861,"Then the angel said , `` These are the true words of God . ''"
7862,Then I bowed down before the angel 's feet to worship him .
7863,"But the angel said to me , `` Do n't worship me !"
7864,I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the truth of Jesus .
7865,So worship God !
7866,Because the truth of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy . ''
7867,Then I saw heaven open .
7868,There before me was a white horse .
7869,"The rider on the horse was called Faithful and True , because he is right in his judging and in making war ."
7870,His eyes were like burning fire .
7871,He had many crowns on his head .
7872,"A name was written on him , but he was the only one who knew its meaning ."
7873,"He was dressed in a robe dipped in blood , and he was called the Word of God ."
7874,The armies of heaven were following the rider on the white horse .
7875,They were also riding white horses .
7876,"They were dressed in fine linen , white and clean ."
7877,"A sharp sword came out of the rider 's mouth , a sword that he would use to defeat the nations ."
7878,And he will rule the nations with a rod of iron .
7879,He will crush the grapes in the winepress of the terrible anger of God All - Powerful .
7880,On his robe and on his leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords Then I saw an angel standing in the sun .
7881,"In a loud voice the angel said to all the birds flying in the sky , `` Come together for the great supper of God ."
7882,Come together so that you can eat the bodies of rulers and army commanders and famous men .
7883,"Come to eat the bodies of the horses and their riders and the bodies of all people -- free , slave , small , and great . ''"
7884,Then I saw the beast and the rulers of the earth .
7885,Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .
7886,"But the beast was captured , and the false prophet was also captured ."
7887,He was the one who did the miracles for the beast .
7888,He had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its idol .
7889,The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
7890,Their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse .
7891,All the birds ate these bodies until they were full .
7892,Kish was an important man from the tribe of Benjamin .
7893,He was the son of Abiel .
7894,Abiel was the son of Zeror .
7895,Zeror was the son of Becorath .
7896,"Becorath was the son of Aphiah , a man from Benjamin ."
7897,"Kish had a son named Saul , who was a handsome young man ."
7898,There was no one more handsome than Saul .
7899,He stood a head taller than any other man in Israel .
7900,"One day , Kish 's donkeys got lost ."
7901,"So he said to his son Saul , `` Take one of the servants and go look for the donkeys . ''"
7902,Saul went to look for the donkeys .
7903,He walked through the hills of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha .
7904,But Saul and the servant could not find Kish 's donkeys .
7905,"So they went to the area around Shaalim , but the donkeys were not there either ."
7906,"Then Saul traveled through the land of Benjamin , but he and the servant still could not find the donkeys ."
7907,"Finally , Saul and the servant came to the town named Zuph ."
7908,"Saul said to his servant , `` Let 's go back ."
7909,My father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us . ''
7910,"But the servant answered , `` A man of God is in this town ."
7911,People respect him .
7912,"Everything he says comes true , so let 's go into town ."
7913,Maybe the man of God will tell us where we should go next . ''
7914,"Saul said to his servant , `` Sure , we can go into town , but what can we give to him ?"
7915,We have no gift to give the man of God .
7916,Even the food in our bags is gone .
7917,What can we give him ? ''
7918,Again the servant answered Saul .
7919,"`` Look , I have a little bit of money ."
7920,Let 's give it to the man of God .
7921,Then he will tell us where we should go . ''
7922,"Saul said to his servant , `` That is a good idea ."
7923,Let 's go . ''
7924,So they went to the town where the man of God was .
7925,Saul and the servant were walking up the hill toward town when they met some young women on the road .
7926,The young women were coming out to get water .
7927,"Saul and the servant asked the young women , `` Is the seer here ? ''"
7928,"-LRB- In the past , people in Israel called a prophet a `` seer . ''"
7929,"So if they wanted to ask something from God , they would say , `` Let 's go to the seer . '' -RRB-"
7930,"The young women answered , `` Yes , the seer is here ."
7931,He is just up the road .
7932,He came to town today .
7933,Some people are meeting together today to share in a fellowship offering at the place for worship .
7934,So go into town and you will find him .
7935,"If you hurry , you can catch him before he goes up to eat at the place for worship ."
7936,"The seer blesses the sacrifice , so the people wo n't begin eating until he gets there ."
7937,"If you hurry , you can find him . ''"
7938,Saul and the servant started walking up the hill to town .
7939,"Just as they came into town , they saw Samuel coming out of town , walking toward them ."
7940,He was on his way to the place for worship .
7941,"The day before , the Lord had told Samuel , `` At this time tomorrow I will send a man to you ."
7942,He will be from the tribe of Benjamin .
7943,You must anoint him and make him the new leader over my people Israel .
7944,This man will save my people from the Philistines .
7945,"I have seen my people suffering , and I have heard their cries for help . ''"
7946,"When Samuel saw Saul , the Lord said to Samuel , `` This is the man I told you about ."
7947,He will rule my people . ''
7948,Saul went up to a man near the gate to ask directions .
7949,This man just happened to be Samuel .
7950,"Saul said , `` Excuse me ."
7951,Could you tell me where the seer 's house is ? ''
7952,"Samuel answered , `` I am the seer ."
7953,Go on up ahead of me to the place for worship .
7954,You and your servant will eat with me today .
7955,I will let you go home tomorrow morning .
7956,I will answer all your questions .
7957,And do n't worry about the donkeys that you lost three days ago .
7958,They have been found .
7959,"Now , there is something that everyone in Israel is looking for and that something is you and your family . ''"
7960,"Saul answered , `` But I am a member of the tribe of Benjamin ."
7961,It is the smallest tribe in Israel .
7962,And my family is the smallest in the tribe of Benjamin .
7963,Why do you say Israel wants me ? ''
7964,Then Samuel took Saul and his servant to the eating area .
7965,About 30 people had been invited to eat together and share the sacrifice .
7966,Samuel gave Saul and his servant the most important place at the table .
7967,"Samuel said to the cook , `` Bring the meat I gave you ."
7968,It is the share I told you to save . ''
7969,The cook brought out the thigh and put it on the table in front of Saul .
7970,"Samuel said , `` Eat the meat that was put in front of you ."
7971,It was saved for you for this special time when I called the people together . ''
7972,So Saul ate with Samuel that day .
7973,"After they finished eating , they came down from the place for worship and went back to town ."
7974,"Samuel made a bed for Saul on the roof , and Saul went to sleep ."
7975,"Early the next morning , Samuel shouted to Saul on the roof and said , `` Get up ."
7976,I will send you on your way . ''
7977,Saul got up and went out of the house with Samuel .
7978,"Saul , his servant , and Samuel were walking together near the edge of town ."
7979,"Samuel said to Saul , `` Tell your servant to go on ahead of us ."
7980,I have a message for you from God . ''
7981,So the servant walked ahead of them .
7982,Saul told his son Jonathan and his officers to kill David .
7983,"But Jonathan liked David very much , so he warned him ."
7984,`` Be careful !
7985,Saul is looking for a chance to kill you .
7986,In the morning go into the field and hide .
7987,I will go out into the field with my father .
7988,We will stand in the field where you are hiding .
7989,"I will talk to my father about you , and I will tell you what I learn . ''"
7990,Jonathan talked to his father Saul .
7991,Jonathan said good things about David .
7992,"He said , `` You are the king ."
7993,David is your servant .
7994,"David has n't done anything wrong to you , so do n't do anything wrong to him ."
7995,He has always been good to you .
7996,He risked his life when he killed the Philistine .
7997,The Lord won a great victory for all Israel .
7998,"You saw it , and you were happy ."
7999,Why do you want to hurt David ?
8000,He 's innocent .
8001,There is no reason to kill him . ''
8002,Saul listened to Jonathan and made a promise .
8003,"He said , `` As surely as the Lord lives , David wo n't be put to death . ''"
8004,So Jonathan called David and told him everything that was said .
8005,"Then Jonathan brought David to Saul , and David was with Saul as before ."
8006,"Once again there was war with the Philistines , and David went out to fight ."
8007,"He defeated them badly , and they ran away ."
8008,"Later , in Saul 's house , David was playing the harp ."
8009,Saul was there with his spear in his hand .
8010,Then an evil spirit from the Lord came on Saul .
8011,Saul threw his spear at David and tried to pin him to the wall .
8012,"David jumped out of the way , so the spear missed him and stuck in the wall ."
8013,"That night , David ran away ."
8014,Saul sent men to watch David 's house .
8015,They stayed there all night .
8016,"They were waiting to kill David in the morning , but David 's wife Michal warned him ."
8017,"She said , `` You must run away tonight and save your life ."
8018,"If you do n't , you will be killed tomorrow . ''"
8019,"Then Michal let David down out of a window , and he escaped and ran away ."
8020,"Michal took the household god , put clothes on it , and put goats ' hair on its head ."
8021,Then she put the statue in the bed .
8022,Saul sent messengers to take David prisoner .
8023,"But Michal said , `` David is sick . ''"
8024,"The men went and told Saul , but he sent the messengers back to see David ."
8025,"Saul told these men , `` Bring David to me ."
8026,"Bring him lying on his bed if you must , even if it kills him . ''"
8027,The messengers went to David 's house .
8028,"They went inside to get him , but they saw it was only a statue and that its hair was only goat 's hair ."
8029,"Saul said to Michal , `` Why did you trick me like this ?"
8030,"You let my enemy escape , and now he is gone . ''"
8031,"Michal answered Saul , `` David told me he would kill me if I did n't help him escape . ''"
8032,David escaped and ran away to Samuel at Ramah .
8033,He told Samuel everything that Saul had done to him .
8034,Then David and Samuel went to the camps where the prophets stayed .
8035,David stayed there .
8036,Saul heard that David was there in the camps near Ramah .
8037,So he sent some men to arrest David .
8038,"But when they came to the camps , there was a group of prophets prophesying ."
8039,Samuel was standing there leading the group .
8040,The Spirit of God came on Saul 's messengers and they began prophesying .
8041,"Saul heard about this , so he sent other messengers , but they also began prophesying ."
8042,"So Saul sent messengers a third time , and they also began prophesying ."
8043,"Finally , Saul himself went to Ramah ."
8044,Saul came to the big well by the threshing floor at Secu .
8045,"He asked , `` Where are Samuel and David ? ''"
8046,"The people answered , `` In the camps near Ramah . ''"
8047,So Saul went out to the camps near Ramah .
8048,"The Spirit of God came on Saul , and he also began prophesying ."
8049,He prophesied all the way to the camps at Ramah .
8050,Saul even took off his clothes .
8051,He lay there naked all day and through the night .
8052,So even Saul prophesied there in front of Samuel .
8053,"That is why people say , `` Is Saul also one of the prophets ? ''"
8054,"Meanwhile , the Philistines had gathered all of their army camps at Aphek ."
8055,The Israelites were camped by the spring near Jezreel .
8056,The Philistine rulers were marching in divisions of 100 and 1000 men .
8057,David and his men were at the back with Achish .
8058,"The Philistine captains asked , `` What are these Hebrews doing here ? ''"
8059,"Achish told the Philistine captains , `` This is David ."
8060,"He was one of Saul 's officers , but he has been with me for a long time ."
8061,I found nothing wrong in David since the time he left Saul and came to me . ''
8062,But the Philistine captains were angry with Achish .
8063,"They said , `` Send him back ."
8064,"Let him go back to the city you gave him , but he ca n't go into battle with us ."
8065,"As long as he is here , we have an enemy in our own camp ."
8066,He would make his king happy by killing our men .
8067,Is n't David the one the Israelites sing about ?
8068,"They dance and sing this song : ' Saul has killed thousands of enemies , but David has killed tens of thousands . ' ''"
8069,"So Achish called David and said , `` As surely as the Lord lives , you are loyal to me ."
8070,I would be pleased to have you serve in my army .
8071,I have n't found anything wrong with you since the day you came to me .
8072,The Philistine rulers also think you are a good man .
8073,Go back in peace .
8074,Do n't do anything against the Philistine rulers . ''
8075,"David asked , `` What have I done wrong ?"
8076,Have you found anything wrong with me since the day I came to you ?
8077,So why wo n't you let me go to fight the enemies of my lord the king ? ''
8078,"Achish answered , `` I believe that you are a good man ."
8079,You are like an angel from God .
8080,"But the Philistine captains still say , ' David ca n't go with us into battle . '"
8081,"Early in the morning , you and your men should go back to the city I gave you ."
8082,Do n't pay attention to the bad things the captains say about you .
8083,"You are a good man , but you must leave as soon as there is enough light in the morning . ''"
8084,"So David and his men got up early in the morning and went back to the country of the Philistines , and the Philistines went up to Jezreel ."
8085,"David asked , `` Is there anyone still left in Saul 's family ?"
8086,I want to show kindness to this person .
8087,I want to do it for Jonathan . ''
8088,There was a servant named Ziba from Saul 's family .
8089,David 's servants called Ziba to David .
8090,"King David said to Ziba , `` Are you Ziba ? ''"
8091,"Ziba said , `` Yes , I am your servant Ziba . ''"
8092,"The king said , `` Is there anyone left in Saul 's family ?"
8093,I want to show God 's kindness to this person . ''
8094,"Ziba said to King David , `` Jonathan has a son still living ."
8095,He is crippled in both feet . ''
8096,"The king said to Ziba , `` Where is this son ? ''"
8097,"Ziba said to the king , `` He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar . ''"
8098,Then King David sent some of his officers to Lo Debar to bring Jonathan 's son from the house of Makir son of Ammiel .
8099,Jonathan 's son Mephibosheth came to David and bowed with his face low to the floor .
8100,"David said , `` Mephibosheth ? ''"
8101,"Mephibosheth said , `` Yes sir , it is I , your servant Mephibosheth . ''"
8102,"David said to Mephibosheth , `` Do n't be afraid ."
8103,I will be kind to you because of your father Jonathan .
8104,I will give back to you all the land of your grandfather Saul .
8105,And you will always be able to eat at my table . ''
8106,"Mephibosheth bowed to David again and he said , `` I am no better than a dead dog , but you are being very kind to me . ''"
8107,"Then King David called Saul 's servant Ziba and said , `` I have given Saul 's family and everything he owns to your master 's grandson , Mephibosheth ."
8108,You will farm the land for Mephibosheth .
8109,Your sons and servants will do this for him .
8110,You will harvest the crops .
8111,"Then your master 's grandson will have plenty of food to eat , but Mephibosheth will always be allowed to eat at my table . ''"
8112,Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants .
8113,"He said to King David , `` I am your servant ."
8114,I will do everything that my lord the king commands . ''
8115,So Mephibosheth ate at David 's table like one of the king 's sons .
8116,Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica .
8117,All the people in Ziba 's family became Mephibosheth 's servants .
8118,Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem .
8119,"He was crippled in both feet , and every day he ate at the king 's table ."
8120,"People told Joab what had happened , `` Look , the king is crying and mourning for Absalom . ''"
8121,So the joy of victory turned to sadness for everyone .
8122,"It was a very sad day because the people heard , `` The king is mourning for his son . ''"
8123,The people came into the city quietly as if they were the ones who had been defeated in battle .
8124,"The king had covered his face and was crying loudly , `` O my son Absalom , O Absalom , my son , my son ! ''"
8125,"Joab came into the king 's palace and said to the king , `` You are humiliating every one of your officers !"
8126,"Look , they saved your life today and the lives of your sons and daughters and your wives and slave women ."
8127,"It seems that you love those who hate you , and you hate those who love you !"
8128,Today you have made it clear to your officers and men that they mean nothing to you .
8129,It appears as if you would have been perfectly happy if Absalom had lived and the rest of us had been killed today !
8130,Now get up and go encourage your officers .
8131,"I swear by the Lord , if you do n't go out and do that right now , not one man will be with you tonight ."
8132,And that will be worse for you than all the trouble you have had since you were a child . ''
8133,So the king went to the city gate .
8134,"The news spread that the king was at the gate , so all the people came to see him , except for the Israelites who had run away to their homes ."
8135,The tribes of Israel began discussing what to do next .
8136,"They said , `` King David saved us from the Philistines and our other enemies ."
8137,David left the country because he was running away from Absalom .
8138,"We anointed Absalom to be the king , but he was killed in battle ."
8139,So we should bring David back to be the king again . ''
8140,King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
8141,"David said , `` Speak to the leaders of Judah and tell them , ' Why are you the last tribe to bring King David back home ?"
8142,"See , all the Israelites are talking about bringing the king back home ."
8143,"You are my brothers , my family , so why are you the last tribe to bring the king back ? '"
8144,"Also tell Amasa , ' You are part of my family ."
8145,I swear that I will make you captain of the army in Joab 's place . ' ''
8146,"David touched the hearts of the people of Judah , and they all agreed as one ."
8147,"The people of Judah sent a message to the king , saying , `` You and all your officers come back ! ''"
8148,King David came to the Jordan River .
8149,The people of Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and take him across the Jordan River .
8150,"Shimei son of Gera , from the tribe of Benjamin , lived in Bahurim ."
8151,"Shimei rushed down to meet King David , with the rest of the people of Judah ."
8152,About 1000 people from the tribe of Benjamin came with Shimei .
8153,Ziba the servant from Saul 's family also came .
8154,Ziba brought his 15 sons and 20 servants with him .
8155,All these people hurried to the Jordan River to meet King David .
8156,The people went across the Jordan River to help bring the king 's family back to Judah .
8157,They did whatever the king wanted .
8158,"While the king was crossing the river , Shimei son of Gera came to meet him ."
8159,He bowed down to the ground in front of the king .
8160,"Shimei said to the king , `` My lord , do n't think about the wrong things I did ."
8161,"My lord and king , do n't remember the bad things I did when you left Jerusalem ."
8162,I know that I sinned .
8163,"That is why today I am the first person from Joseph 's family to come down and meet you , my lord and king . ''"
8164,"Abishai son of Zeruiah said , `` Let 's kill him for all the bad things he said about the Lord 's chosen king . ''"
8165,"David said , `` What should I do with you , sons of Zeruiah ?"
8166,Are you trying to cause me trouble ?
8167,No one will be put to death in Israel today !
8168,Today I know that I am king over Israel . ''
8169,"Then the king said to Shimei , `` You will not die . ''"
8170,The king made a promise to Shimei that he himself would not kill Shimei .
8171,"Saul 's grandson , Mephibosheth , came down to meet King David ."
8172,"Mephibosheth had not cared for his feet , trimmed his mustache , or washed his clothes since the day the king left Jerusalem ."
8173,"When he met the king at Jerusalem , the king said , `` Mephibosheth , why did n't you go with me when I ran away from Jerusalem ? ''"
8174,"Mephibosheth answered , `` My lord and king , my servant tricked me ."
8175,"I am crippled so I said to my servant , Ziba , ' Go saddle a donkey for me so that I can go with the king . '"
8176,But my servant tricked me and said bad things about me .
8177,"My lord and king , you are like an angel from God ."
8178,Do whatever you think is right .
8179,"You could have killed all my grandfather 's family , but you did not do that ."
8180,"Instead , you included me among the people who eat at your own table ."
8181,So I do n't have a right to complain to the king about anything . ''
8182,"The king said to Mephibosheth , `` Do n't say anything more about your problems ."
8183,This is what I have decided : You and Ziba will divide the land . ''
8184,"Mephibosheth said to the king , `` My lord and king , it is enough that you have come home in peace ."
8185,Let Ziba have the land . ''
8186,Barzillai of Gilead came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan River with King David and send him on his way home .
8187,"Barzillai was a very old man , 80 years old ."
8188,He had given the king food and other things when David was staying at Mahanaim .
8189,Barzillai could do this because he was a very rich man .
8190,"David said to Barzillai , `` Come across the river with me ."
8191,I will take care of you if you will live in Jerusalem with me . ''
8192,"But Barzillai said to the king , `` Do you know how old I am ?"
8193,Do you think I can go with you to Jerusalem ?
8194,I am 80 years old !
8195,I am too old to tell what is bad or good .
8196,I can not taste what I eat or drink or hear the voices of men and women singers .
8197,Why should you want to be bothered with me ?
8198,I do n't need any of the things that you want to give me .
8199,I will cross the Jordan River with you .
8200,Then please let me go back so that I can die in my own town and be buried in the grave of my father and mother .
8201,"But here is Kimham ; take him back with you as a servant , my lord and king ."
8202,Do whatever you want with him . ''
8203,"The king answered , `` Kimham will go back with me ."
8204,I will be kind to him for you .
8205,I will do anything for you . ''
8206,The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him .
8207,"Barzillai went back home , and the king and all the people went across the river ."
8208,The king crossed the Jordan River to Gilgal .
8209,Kimham went with him .
8210,All the people of Judah and half the people of Israel led David across the river .
8211,"All the Israelites came to the king and said to him , `` Why did our brothers , the people of Judah , steal you away ?"
8212,Why did they bring you and your family back across the Jordan River with your men ? ''
8213,"All the people of Judah answered the Israelites , `` We did it because the king is our close relative ."
8214,Why are you angry with us about this ?
8215,We have not eaten food at the king 's expense .
8216,The king did not give us any gifts . ''
8217,"The Israelites answered , `` We have ten shares in David , so we have more right to David than you do ."
8218,Why did you ignore us ?
8219,We were the first ones to talk about bringing our king back . ''
8220,But the people of Judah replied with words that were even louder and angrier than those of the Israelites .
8221,So Solomon finished building the Lord 's Temple and his own palace .
8222,Solomon built everything that he wanted to build .
8223,"Then the Lord appeared to Solomon again , just as he did at Gibeon ."
8224,"The Lord said to him , `` I heard your prayer and what you asked me to do ."
8225,"You built this Temple , and I have made it a holy place ."
8226,So I will be honored there forever .
8227,I will watch over it and think of it always .
8228,"You must serve me with a pure and honest heart , just as your father David did ."
8229,You must obey my laws and do everything that I commanded you .
8230,"If you do , I will make sure that your family will always rule Israel , just as I promised your father David when I told him that Israel would always be ruled by one of his descendants ."
8231,"`` But if you or your children stop following me , and do n't obey the laws and commands that I have given you , and if you serve and worship other gods , I will force Israel to leave the land that I have given to them ."
8232,Israel will be an example to other people .
8233,Other people will make jokes about Israel .
8234,I made the Temple holy .
8235,It is the place where people honor me .
8236,But I will tear it down .
8237,This Temple will be destroyed .
8238,Everyone who sees it will be amazed .
8239,"They will ask , ' Why did the Lord do this terrible thing to this land and to this temple ? '"
8240,"People will say , ' This happened because they left the Lord their God ."
8241,"He brought their ancestors out of Egypt , but they decided to follow other gods ."
8242,They began to worship and serve those gods .
8243,That is why the Lord caused all these bad things to happen to them . ' ''
8244,It took 20 years for King Solomon to build the Lord 's Temple and the king 's palace .
8245,"Hiram supplied Solomon with all the cedar , pine and gold that he wanted , so Solomon gave him 20 cities in Galilee ."
8246,So Hiram traveled from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him .
8247,But Hiram was not pleased when he saw them .
8248,"King Hiram said , `` What are these towns that you have given me , my brother ? ''"
8249,King Hiram named that land the Land of Cabul .
8250,And that area is still called Cabul today .
8251,Hiram had sent King Solomon about 9000 pounds of gold to use in building the Temple .
8252,King Solomon forced slaves to work for him to build the Temple and his palace .
8253,Then he used these slaves to build many other things .
8254,He built the Millo and the city wall around Jerusalem .
8255,"Then he rebuilt the cities of Hazor , Megiddo , and Gezer ."
8256,In the past the king of Egypt had fought against the city of Gezer and burned it .
8257,He killed the Canaanites who lived there .
8258,"When Solomon married Pharaoh 's daughter , Pharaoh gave him that city as a wedding present ."
8259,Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the city of Lower Beth Horon .
8260,He also built the cities of Baalath and Tamar in the Judean desert .
8261,"He also built cities where he could store grain , and he built places for his chariots and his horses ."
8262,"King Solomon also built whatever he wanted in Jerusalem , Lebanon , and all the places he ruled ."
8263,There were people left in the land who were not Israelites .
8264,"There were Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites ."
8265,"The Israelites had not been able to destroy them , but Solomon forced them to work for him as slaves ."
8266,They are still slaves today .
8267,Solomon did not force any Israelites to be his slaves .
8268,"The Israelites were soldiers , government officials , officers , captains , and chariot commanders and drivers ."
8269,There were 550 supervisors over Solomon 's projects .
8270,They supervised the men who did the work .
8271,Pharaoh 's daughter moved from the City of David to the palace that Solomon had built for her .
8272,Then he built the Millo .
8273,Three times each year Solomon offered burned sacrifices and fellowship offerings on the altar that he built for the Lord .
8274,King Solomon also burned incense before the Lord and supplied what was needed for the Temple .
8275,King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber .
8276,"This town is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom ."
8277,King Hiram had some skilled sailors who knew the sea well .
8278,He sent them to serve in Solomon 's navy and work with Solomon 's men .
8279,Solomon 's ships went to Ophir and brought back about 16 tons of gold for him .
8280,King Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah did and how Elijah had killed all the prophets of Baal with a sword .
8281,"So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah and said , `` I swear that by this time tomorrow , you will be just as dead as those prophets ."
8282,"If I do n't succeed , may the gods do the same or worse to me . ''"
8283,"When Elijah heard this , he was afraid ."
8284,So he ran away to save his life .
8285,"He took his servant with him , and they went to Beersheba in Judah ."
8286,Then Elijah left his servant in Beersheba and walked for a whole day into the desert .
8287,Then he sat down under a bush and asked to die .
8288,"He said , `` I have had enough , Lord !"
8289,Take my life .
8290,I am no better than my ancestors . ''
8291,Then Elijah lay down under the bush and went to sleep .
8292,An angel came to him and touched him .
8293,"The angel said , `` Get up and eat ! ''"
8294,"Elijah looked around , and by his head there was a cake that had been baked over coals and a jar of water ."
8295,He ate and drank and then went back to sleep .
8296,"Later the Lord 's angel came to him again , touched him , and said , `` Get up and eat !"
8297,"If you do n't , you will not be strong enough to make the long trip . ''"
8298,So Elijah got up .
8299,He ate and drank and felt strong .
8300,"Then Elijah walked for 40 days and nights to Mount Horeb , the mountain of God ."
8301,There Elijah went into a cave and spent the night .
8302,"Then the Lord said to him , `` Elijah , why are you here ? ''"
8303,"Elijah answered , `` Lord God All-Powerful , I have always served you the best I can , but the Israelites have broken their agreement with you ."
8304,They destroyed your altars and killed your prophets .
8305,"I am the only prophet left alive , and now they are trying to kill me ! ''"
8306,"Then the Lord said to Elijah , `` Go , stand in front of me on the mountain ."
8307,I will pass by you . ''
8308,Then a very strong wind blew .
8309,The wind caused the mountains to break apart .
8310,It broke large rocks in front of the Lord .
8311,But that wind was not the Lord .
8312,"After that wind , there was an earthquake ."
8313,But that earthquake was not the Lord .
8314,"After the earthquake , there was a fire ."
8315,But that fire was not the Lord .
8316,"After the fire , there was a quiet , gentle voice ."
8317,"When Elijah heard the voice , he used his coat to cover his face and went to the entrance to the cave and stood there ."
8318,"Then a voice said to him , `` Elijah , why are you here ? ''"
8319,"Elijah said , `` Lord God All-Powerful , I have always served you the best that I can , but the Israelites broke their agreement with you ."
8320,They destroyed your altars and killed your prophets .
8321,"I am the only prophet left alive , and now they are trying to kill me . ''"
8322,"The Lord said , `` Go back ."
8323,Take the road that leads to the desert around Damascus .
8324,Go into Damascus and anoint Hazael as king over Aram .
8325,Then anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel .
8326,"Next , anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah ."
8327,He will be the prophet who takes your place .
8328,"Jehu will kill anyone who escapes Hazael 's sword , and Elisha will kill anyone who escapes from Jehu 's sword ."
8329,I still have 7000 people in Israel who have never bowed down to Baal or kissed that idol . ''
8330,So Elijah left that place and went to find Elisha son of Shaphat .
8331,Elisha was plowing 12 acres of land and was working on the last acre when Elijah came .
8332,Elijah went to Elisha and put his coat on Elisha .
8333,Elisha immediately left his oxen and ran after Elijah .
8334,"Elisha said , `` Let me kiss my mother and father goodbye ."
8335,Then I will follow you . ''
8336,"Elijah answered , `` You can do that ."
8337,I will not stop you . ''
8338,Elisha turned away from him and went back .
8339,He killed the oxen and used the yoke for firewood .
8340,"He boiled the meat , gave it to the people , and they all ate together ."
8341,Then Elisha went to follow Elijah and became his helper .
8342,"Elisha the prophet called one of the men from the group of prophets and said to him , `` Get ready and take this small bottle of oil in your hand ."
8343,Go to Ramoth Gilead .
8344,"When you arrive , find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat , the son of Nimshi ."
8345,Then go in and make him get up from among his brothers .
8346,Take him to an inner room .
8347,Take the small bottle of oil and pour the oil on Jehu 's head .
8348,"Say , ' This is what the Lord says : I have anointed you to be the new king over Israel . '"
8349,Then open the door and run away .
8350,Do n't wait ! ''
8351,"So this young man , the prophet , went to Ramoth Gilead ."
8352,"When the young man arrived , he saw the captains of the army sitting ."
8353,"He said , `` Captain , I have a message for you . ''"
8354,"Jehu asked , `` Which one of us is the message for ? ''"
8355,"The young man said , `` For you , sir . ''"
8356,Jehu got up and went into the house .
8357,"Then the young prophet poured the oil on Jehu 's head and said to him , `` The Lord , the God of Israel , says , ' I am anointing you to be the new king over the Lord 's people , Israel ."
8358,You must destroy the family of Ahab your king .
8359,"In this way I will punish Jezebel for the deaths of my servants , the prophets , and the deaths of all the Lord 's servants who were murdered ."
8360,So all Ahab 's family will die .
8361,I will not let any male child in Ahab 's family live .
8362,It does n't matter if that male child is a slave or a free person in Israel .
8363,I will make Ahab 's family like the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of Baasha son of Ahijah .
8364,"The dogs will eat Jezebel in the area of Jezreel , and she will not be buried . ' ''"
8365,Then the young prophet opened the door and ran away .
8366,Jehu went back to his king 's officers .
8367,"One of the officers said to Jehu , `` Is everything all right ?"
8368,Why did this crazy man come to you ? ''
8369,"Jehu answered the servants , `` You know the man and the crazy things he says . ''"
8370,"The officers said , `` No , tell us the truth ."
8371,What did he say ? ''
8372,Jehu told the officers what the young prophet said .
8373,"Jehu said , `` He said a few things and then he said , ' This is what the Lord says : I have anointed you to be the new king over Israel . ' ''"
8374,Then each officer quickly took his robe off and put it on the steps in front of Jehu .
8375,"Then they blew the trumpet and made the announcement , `` Jehu is king ! ''"
8376,"So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat , son of Nimshi , made plans against Joram ."
8377,At that time Joram and the Israelites had been trying to defend Ramoth Gilead from King Hazael of Aram .
8378,King Joram had fought against King Hazael of Aram .
8379,"But the Arameans wounded King Joram , and he went to Jezreel to get well from those injuries ."
8380,"So Jehu told the officers , `` If you agree that I am the new king , do n't let anyone escape from the city to tell the news in Jezreel . ''"
8381,"Joram was resting in Jezreel , so Jehu got in his chariot and drove to Jezreel ."
8382,King Ahaziah of Judah had also come to Jezreel to see Joram .
8383,A guard was standing on the tower in Jezreel .
8384,He saw Jehu 's large group coming .
8385,"He said , `` I see a large group of people ! ''"
8386,"Joram said , `` Send someone on a horse to meet them ."
8387,Tell this messenger to ask if they come in peace . ''
8388,So the messenger rode on a horse to meet Jehu .
8389,"The messenger said , `` King Joram says , ' Do you come in peace ? ' ''"
8390,"Jehu said , `` You have nothing to do with peace ."
8391,Come and follow me . ''
8392,"The guard told Joram , `` The messenger went to the group , but he has not come back yet . ''"
8393,Then Joram sent out a second messenger on a horse .
8394,"This man came to Jehu 's group and said , `` King Joram says , ' Peace . ' ''"
8395,"Jehu answered , `` You have nothing to do with peace ."
8396,Come and follow me . ''
8397,"The guard told Joram , `` The second messenger went to the group , but he has not come back yet ."
8398,There is a man driving his chariot like a mad man .
8399,He is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi . ''
8400,"Joram said , `` Get me my chariot ! ''"
8401,So the servant got Joram 's chariot .
8402,Both King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah got their chariots and drove out to meet Jehu .
8403,They met him at the property of Naboth from Jezreel .
8404,"Joram saw Jehu and asked , `` Do you come in peace , Jehu ? ''"
8405,"Jehu answered , `` There is no peace as long as your mother Jezebel does many acts of prostitution and witchcraft . ''"
8406,Joram turned the horses to run away .
8407,"He said to Ahaziah , `` It is a trick , Ahaziah ! ''"
8408,"But Jehu grabbed his bow and shot Joram in the middle of his back , through the heart ."
8409,Joram fell dead in his chariot .
8410,"Jehu said to his chariot driver Bidkar , `` Take Joram 's body up and throw it into the field of Naboth from Jezreel ."
8411,"Remember when you and I rode together with Joram 's father Ahab , the Lord said this would happen to him ."
8412,"The Lord said , ' Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons ."
8413,So I will punish Ahab in this field . '
8414,The Lord said that .
8415,"So take Joram 's body and throw it into the field , just as he said . ''"
8416,King Ahaziah of Judah saw this and ran away .
8417,"He tried to escape through the garden house , but Jehu followed him ."
8418,"Jehu had said , `` Shoot Ahaziah too ! ''"
8419,Ahaziah was wounded when he was in his chariot on the road to Gur near Ibleam .
8420,"He got as far as Megiddo , but he died there ."
8421,Ahaziah 's servants carried his body in the chariot to Jerusalem .
8422,They buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David .
8423,Ahaziah had become king over Judah during Joram 's eleventh year as king of Israel .
8424,"When Jehu came to Jezreel , Jezebel heard the news ."
8425,She put her makeup on and fixed her hair .
8426,Then she stood by the window and looked out .
8427,Jehu entered the city .
8428,"Jezebel said , `` Hello , you Zimri ."
8429,You killed your master just as he did . ''
8430,"Jehu looked up at the window and said , `` Who is on my side ?"
8431,Who ? ''
8432,Two or three eunuchs looked out at Jehu .
8433,"Jehu said , `` Throw Jezebel down ! ''"
8434,Then the eunuchs threw her down .
8435,Some of her blood splashed on the wall and on the horses that trampled her body .
8436,Jehu went into the house and ate and drank .
8437,"Then he said , `` Now see about this cursed woman ."
8438,"Bury her , because she is a king 's daughter . ''"
8439,"The men went to bury Jezebel , but they could not find her body ."
8440,"They could only find her skull , her feet , and the palms of her hands ."
8441,"When the men came back and told Jehu , he said , `` The Lord told his servant Elijah the Tishbite to give this message : ' Dogs will eat the body of Jezebel in the area of Jezreel ."
8442,Her body will be like dung on the field in the area of Jezreel .
8443,No one will be able to recognize her body ! ' ''
8444,"When King Hezekiah heard this , he tore his clothes to show he was upset ."
8445,Then he put on sackcloth and went to the Lord 's Temple .
8446,"Hezekiah sent Eliakim the palace manager , Shebna the royal secretary , and the elders of the priests to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz ."
8447,They wore the special clothes that showed they were sad and upset .
8448,"They said to Isaiah , `` King Hezekiah has commanded that today will be a special day for sorrow and sadness ."
8449,"It will be a very sad day , like the time a child should be born , but is not strong enough to come from its mother 's womb ."
8450,"The commander 's master , the king of Assyria , has sent him to say bad things about the living God ."
8451,Maybe the Lord your God will hear all those things .
8452,Maybe he will prove the enemy is wrong !
8453,So pray for the people who are still left alive . ''
8454,King Hezekiah 's officers went to Isaiah .
8455,"Isaiah said to them , `` Give this message to your master , Hezekiah : The Lord says , ' Do n't be afraid of what you heard from the commanders ."
8456,Do n't believe what those `` boys '' from the king of Assyria said to make fun of me .
8457,"Look , I will send a spirit against the king of Assyria ."
8458,"He will get a report warning him about a danger , so he will return to his own country ."
8459,And I will cut him down with a sword in his own country . ' ''
8460,The commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish .
8461,"He found him at Libnah , fighting against that city ."
8462,"Then the king of Assyria heard a report that said , `` Tirhakah , the king of Ethiopia , has come to fight against you . ''"
8463,So the king of Assyria sent messengers to Hezekiah again .
8464,"He told them , `` Tell King Hezekiah of Judah these things : ' Do n't be fooled by the god you trust when he says Jerusalem will not be defeated by the king of Assyria ."
8465,You have heard what the kings of Assyria did to all the other countries .
8466,We completely destroyed them !
8467,Will you be saved ?
8468,No !
8469,Did the gods of those nations save their people ?
8470,"No , my ancestors destroyed them all ."
8471,"They destroyed Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and the people of Eden living in Tel Assar ."
8472,Where is the king of Hamath ?
8473,The king of Arpad ?
8474,The king of the city of Sepharvaim ?
8475,The kings of Hena and Ivvah ? ' ''
8476,Hezekiah received the letters from the messengers and read them .
8477,Then he went up to the Lord 's Temple and laid the letters out in front of the Lord .
8478,"Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said , `` Lord , God of Israel , you sit as King above the Cherub angels ."
8479,You alone are the God who rules all the kingdoms on earth .
8480,You made heaven and earth .
8481,"Lord , please listen to me ."
8482,"Lord , open your eyes and look at this message ."
8483,Hear the words that Sennacherib sent to insult the living God .
8484,"It is true , Lord ."
8485,The kings of Assyria did destroy all those nations .
8486,They did throw the gods of those nations into the fire .
8487,But they were not real gods .
8488,They were only wood and stone -- statues that people made .
8489,That is why the kings of Assyria could destroy them .
8490,"But you are the Lord our God , so please save us from the king of Assyria ."
8491,"Then all the other nations will know that you , Lord , are the only God . ''"
8492,Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah .
8493,"Isaiah said , `` The Lord , the God of Israel , says this : You prayed to me about the message that came from King Sennacherib of Assyria ."
8494,I have heard you .
8495,`` This is the Lord 's message against Sennacherib : ' The virgin daughter Zion does not think you are important .
8496,She makes fun of you .
8497,Daughter Jerusalem shakes her head at you and laughs behind your back .
8498,But who did you insult and make fun of ?
8499,Who did you speak against ?
8500,You were against the Holy One of Israel .
8501,You acted like you were better than he was !
8502,You sent your messengers to insult the Lord .
8503,"You said , `` I came with my many chariots to the high mountains deep inside Lebanon ."
8504,I cut down the tallest cedar trees and the best fir trees of Lebanon .
8505,"I went to its highest mountains , its thickest forests ."
8506,"I dug wells , and drank water from new places ."
8507,I dried up the rivers of Egypt and walked on the land there . ''
8508,"That is what you said , but have n't you heard what I said ?"
8509,I planned it long ago ; from ancient times I planned it .
8510,And now I have made it happen .
8511,I let you tear down the strong cities and change them into piles of rocks .
8512,The people in the cities had no power .
8513,They were afraid and confused .
8514,They were about to be cut down like grass and plants in the field .
8515,"They were like grass growing on the housetops , dying before it grows tall ."
8516,"I know all about your battles ; I know when you rested , when you went out to war , and when you came home ."
8517,I also know when you got upset at me .
8518,"Yes , you were upset at me ."
8519,I heard your proud insults .
8520,So I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth .
8521,Then I will turn you around and lead you back the way you came . ' ''
8522,"Then the Lord said , `` I will give you a sign to show that these words are true ."
8523,"You were not able to plant seeds this year , so next year you will eat grain that grows wild from the previous year 's crop ."
8524,"But in the third year , you will eat grain from seeds that you planted ."
8525,You will harvest your crops and have plenty to eat .
8526,You will plant grapevines and eat their fruit .
8527,You will plant vineyards and eat the grapes from them .
8528,The people from the family of Judah who have escaped and are left alive will be like plants that send their roots deep into the ground and produce fruit above the ground .
8529,That is because a few people will come out of Jerusalem alive .
8530,There will be survivors coming from Mount Zion .
8531,The strong love of the Lord God will do this .
8532,`` So the Lord says this about the king of Assyria : ' He will not come into this city or shoot an arrow at this city .
8533,He will not bring his shields up against this city or build up a hill of dirt to attack its walls .
8534,"He will go back the way he came , and he will not come into this city ."
8535,The Lord says this .
8536,I will protect this city and save it .
8537,I will do this for myself and for my servant David . ' ''
8538,"That night the angel of the Lord went out and killed 185,000 people in the Assyrian camp ."
8539,"When the others got up in the morning , they saw all the dead bodies ."
8540,So King Sennacherib of Assyria left and went back to Nineveh where he stayed .
8541,"One day Sennacherib was in the temple of his god Nisroch , worshiping him ."
8542,His sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword and ran away to Ararat .
8543,So his son Esarhaddon became the new king of Assyria .
8544,"%um , how are you guys ?"
8545,How is Chris
8546,and how are you ?
8547,Well pretty well .
8548,Chris is not here at the moment .

8625,.
8626,yeah .
8627,"No , she was not doing well ."
8628,She had a brain tumor .
8629,And then they operated on

8659,"The right eye is %uh , not so great ."
8660,%hm .
8661,"%um , and it got back to about eighty percent ."
8662,You know it was a detached retina .
8663,Right .
8664,"And then they operated on it once ,"
8665,and they operated on it twice .
8666,"And , then things seemed to be doing pretty well ,"
8667,"and at the moment I 'm %um , not quite so sure ."
8668,%hm .
8669,"So , who knows . %um ."
8670,%hm .
8671,But you know it 'll never be more than about seventy or eighty percent . Which is fine .
8672,Eighty percent is fantastic .
8673,Right .
8674,Right .
8675,%um
8676,So we 'll just see . You know
8677,%hm . we 'll see what happens .
8678,Frustrating .
8679,"%uh , yeah ."
8680,Annoying .
8681,"And that thing that came up recently , , you know I had , oh , a kind of a knee problem a couple of years ago ."
8682,"And my right knee ,"
8683,and now it 's my left knee .
8684,"you know , it 's just a pain in the ass ."
8685,"And yeah . %um , I went to the doctor"
8686,and they do a Punktion . Ich weiss nicht wer .
8687,"Anyway they take , %uh fluid out of it ."
8688,uh-huh .
8689,And if it gets irritated take some pills and stuff .
8690,"And , it 's just a pain in the ass ."
8691,"So it 's just , l- ."
8692,is that like water on the knee ?
8693,Is that what that is ?
8694,"%um , well that 's what happens ."
8695,"It develops because of irritation , because of a %um , inflammation ."
8696,%hm .
8697,Is that from the running ?
8698,And how the inflammation d-
8699,"yeah ,"
8700,maybe .
8701,I mean they do n't know .
8702,mhm .
8703,They do n't
8704,It just came overnight practically .
8705,Wow .
8706,"%um , and %uh , we 'd been up in Berlin"
8707,"and we had a big trip up there and did a lot of walking , a lot of fast walking and stuff ."
8708,"But you know , I mean that mhm . should n't be a big deal . %um"
8709,Was this last crop of **Tuftees** good ?
8710,So .
8711,Was your last crop of students from Tufts good ?
8712,How 's that ?
8713,yeah
8714,well they 're still here .
8715,"Right ,"
8716,"but they 're winding down , so you know them really well by this point ."
8717,They 're winding down .
8718,"yeah ,"
8719,they 're very good .
8720,they learned a lot of German .
8721,They learned an amazing amount of German .
8722,"Before I forget , I saw George Silinas a couple of days ago ."
8723,oh . How 's he doing ?
8724,And he 's had
8725,"Well he 's working for an American firm over here ,"
8726,"and he 's doing very very well . %um ,"
8727,and his wife just had their fourth child .
8728,Wow .
8729,A little boy . Benjamin .
8730,yeah .
8731,Wow .
8732,"%um , about , %uh , two weeks ago maybe ."
8733,%huh .
8734,Tops .
8735,"And I got a card from ,"
8736,you remember Amy Gleason ?
8737,yeah .
8738,yeah .
8739,Well she just had a baby a couple of
8740,heard that .
8741,Well this is number two .
8742,okay .
8743,"I just got a card from Ron and Doris ,"
8744,oh .
8745,and they see Amy Gleason on occasion .
8746,And so I think they told me that .
8747,yeah .
8748,Have you heard from Ron and Doris ?
8749,"Not in a while , no ."
8750,They are now living in Rhode Island .
8751,You probably knew that .
8752,Well . yeah .
8753,And she 's teaching at U R I .
8754,yeah .
8755,"And it was a very nice letter , because it sounded like she went through very similar things that I did ."
8756,"You know , I went from Chicago to U C S G to here ."
8757,Right .
8758,And it 's just such an intellectual letdown .
8759,Right .
8760,"And she went from Penn , %um To Columbia . to Columbia to U R I ."
8761,Well Columbia 's okay .
8762,yeah .
8763,"And she said the students are just ,"
8764,"you know , they do n't care ,"
8765,"and they 're not very good ,"
8766,and all of a sudden she 's getting conference papers rejected
8767,and she thinks it 's the affiliation .
8768,yeah .
8769,Because she does n't think the quality of her work has changed .
8770,"Now I have n't submitted a conference paper with the Missouri %um , you know , affiliation yet ."
8771,"Because the last one I submitted , %um , was in the fall ,"
8772,and I still had my San Diego affiliation .
8773,yeah .
8774,"%um , in fact I 'm still officially on leave ."
8775,"If anything came up in the next year we could still go back . uh-huh . %uh you know , for Sam ."
8776,Wow .
8777,But I think it 's very very very very yeah . unlikely .
8778,yeah .
8779,"But at any rate it was nice to hear from her because she said after two years there now , she %um has come to terms with this ,"
8780,and yeah . she 's accepted that there 's a lot of good things in Rhode Island .
8781,"And , %um , you know , their life is a lot less complicated ,"
8782,and she has more time to be a parent .
8783,yeah .
8784,Good .
8785,And she 's just not going to have the same kind of career that she had thought about .
8786,"Ron is working as a financial consultant for , %um , Meryl Lynch ."
8787,And he
8788,oh .
8789,"yeah , he had been doing work for some environmental firm , as a consultant ."
8790,uh-huh .
8791,"And , it did n't work out ."
8792,%um He was changing projects every couple of weeks
8793,and he said he could n't keep on top of it .
8794,He could n't learn the whole new area %mm . that fast each time .
8795,%mm .
8796,"%um , and he says he went in and had some tests ,"
8797,and he was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder .
8798,"Which you know , given how far he 's gotten , you know , he got his degree at Tufts and all , I found that surprising that for the first time as an adult they 're diagnosing this . %um"
8799,%mm . I wonder about it .
8800,But anyway .
8801,"yeah ,"
8802,but that 's what he said .
8803,And %um
8804,yeah .
8805,He %um
8806,Whatever 's helpful .
8807,Right .
8808,So he found this new job as a financial consultant and seems to be happy with that .
8809,Good .
8810,And then we saw Leo and Julie at Christmas time .
8811,uh-huh .
8812,And they 're doing great .
8813,"%um , they had just moved to He 's in New York now , right ? a really nice house in Westchester ."
8814,"yeah , Good . an older home that you know Julie is of course carving up and making beautiful . %um"
8815,uh-huh .
8816,"Now she had a job with an architectural group when she first got out to New York ,"
8817,and that did n't work out .
8818,She said they had her doing things that she really was n't qualified to do %ah . and that she really did n't feel competent doing .
8819,"And , they mutually agreed that she should leave ."
8820,And so she was looking for another job .
8821,"And , %um , I 'm sure she 'll find one ."
8822,She 's so talented .
8823,She may have found one by now . %um
8824,"yeah ,"
8825,oh yeah .
8826,"Amazing ,"
8827,yeah .
8828,"yeah ,"
8829,"and so we met , %um , %uh Adrian , their kid , who was three uh-huh . and just a really lovely little boy ."
8830,right
8831,yeah
8832,He 's so big .
8833,"Well , , Leo 's big . You know ,"
8834,he 's got Leo 's genes .
8835,yeah .
8836,yeah .
8837,And %uh Ron and Doris sent us a picture of theirs
8838,and he has Ron 's expressions .
8839,He really looks like Ron .
8840,oh that 's life .
8841,"%um , and he looked really big too ."
8842,"In this picture , he 's three and a half ."
8843,yeah .
8844,%huh .
8845,"%um , but Leo and Julie just seemed , %um sort of happy with the decisions they 've made ."
8846,And
8847,Good .
8848,"%um , like every"
8849,now is he with a publishing house now ?
8850,Which one is he with .
8851,Yes which one %um
8852,Well I can
8853,yeah
8854,It 's one of these sort of universi- the public university book stuff .
8855,It might be Hard Core Brace .
8856,I 'm not sure .
8857,oh yeah .
8858,I have two friends in publishing .
8859,It may be the other one that just took the job with Hard Core Brace
8860,I do n't remember which one .
8861,yeah .
8862,"Anyway , he 's enjoying it and liking it"
8863,and they 're doing okay .
8864,yeah
8865,he seems to feel really like he 's doing the right thing
8866,and he is Great still in academic publishing .
8867,My other friend just moved to trade publishing after years in academic publishing
8868,and mhm %um you know . It feels like maybe she made a compromise
8869,but it 's like three times the money as with everything else
8870,so
8871,wow wow
8872,industry and academics %um
8873,Terrible
8874,yeah it 's amazing
8875,and %um You know ages ago I got a card from Liz Gana .
8876,I told you this .
8877,because %uh you showed us her picture .
8878,yeah
8879,yeah
8880,Crazy
8881,%um and I keep thinking maybe I 'd get in touch
8882,but I have n't done it .
8883,and then I saw in the %um Tufts thing that Ginny Totta you know in the alumni thing is living in the
8884,yeah
8885,"So , anyway , how are you doing these days ?"
8886,Things are going very well .
8887,"I think I had mentioned before %uh , that there 's a company now that I 'm working with %um , %uh , which is very much just myself and Guss ."
8888,oh .
8889,And that %um
8890,"No , you had n't mentioned that ."
8891,"%eh , oh , okay ."
8892,"okay , so %um"
8893,"%eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at ,"
8894,and you were entertaining offers .
8895,"And , %uh"
8896,"well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts ."
8897,%um oh . So things are going extremely well .
8898,"So , I had one client who said that he 'd pay me a minimum amount ."
8899,"You know , he , %uh ,"
8900,"there would be a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then"
8901,so I decided that it would make sense to do this .
8902,"%um and , %um , I 've been getting substantially more work than then ."
8903,%mm .
8904,So I 'm quite pleased .
8905,Well that 's good .
8906,"%um , so I have a bunch of %uh work that I need to do on my flat this year ."
8907,I 've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time .
8908,"But , %uh , it should come out this year ."
8909,"oh , well that 's good ."
8910,It should be done in a few months .
8911,"oh , yeah"
8912,I remember So you talking a little bit about it at one point .
8913,"yeah ,"
8914,yeah .
8915,So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ?
8916,"%um . I do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while ."
8917,"%um , actually right at the moment finances are not going real well ."
8918,But %ah well . I am working on that one .
8919,%uh .
8920,"It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had ."
8921,"oh , harsh . Harsh ."
8922,yeah .
8923,"yeah ,"
8924,and .
8925,Not a whole lot I can do about that now .
8926,Indeed . Indeed .
8927,have to deal with the situation .
8928,And
8929,So that 's what I 'm doing .
8930,Sounds good .
8931,"But %um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent has been work ."
8932,I 've actually been doing a lot of it .
8933,oh wow .
8934,"And %uh , I turned in my Master 's thesis back in May ,"
8935,"and I 'm actually presently working on , %um , several , %uh , articles oh , okay . Impressive . from it ."
8936,"yeah ,"
8937,"actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature ."
8938,"You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half ."
8939,yeah .
8940,And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n't much discussion .
8941,yeah .
8942,"yup ,"
8943,yup .
8944,"But , %um Anyway , I had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique ."
8945,mhm .
8946,"And it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimentally ,"
8947,"but none of the other models %uh , had ?"
8948,Yes .
8949,"the- ,"
8950,"I 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers ."
8951,"And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency ."
8952,Yes .
8953,okay .
8954,"if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency ."
8955,okay .
8956,So what 's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .
8957,"And %uh With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient ,"
8958,"but you ca n't find that frequency in a driven , %uh , frequency ."
8959,You ca n't find so that it will sustain .
8960,okay .
8961,Yes .
8962,"So yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly ."
8963,And so you should n't actually really be able to ever see it .
8964,%hm .
8965,"The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it ."
8966,"Got it ,"
8967,got it .
8968,I see .
8969,"So , %um , I found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble ."
8970,But yeah . it gives a driving term .
8971,"oh , okay ."
8972,"So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n't always write it down very easily ."
8973,Exactly .
8974,oh wow .
8975,"so you 're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , %uh , whatever it is science ."
8976,But
8977,"which , %um , is kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing . . Indeed . Indeed . being an experimentalist , not a theorist ."
8978,"%um Indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . But"
8979,so are you going to get an article in Nature or something ?
8980,"%um , actually , I 'm not sure if we 're shooting for op- ,"
8981,"I think Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters ."
8982,%hm .
8983,"But , %uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles ."
8984,yeah .
8985,%hm . impressive .
8986,"And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,"
8987,"but letters are much more prestigious than , articles ."
8988,"oh , okay ."
8989,"oh , I did n't realize that ."
8990,okay .
8991,"yeah ,"
8992,so that 's why it 's actually a big deal is
8993,"I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physics"
8994,"and yeah . %uh , it 's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all ."
8995,And what 's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant .
8996,"And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion ,"
8997,and it 's true
8998,they do in the transients
8999,And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients Yes . %eh and not driven .
9000,"And , %uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency ,"
9001,yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .
9002,oh cool .
9003,and so Neil then -- Said oh just a second I -- like a week later came to Bryn Mawr
9004,"and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up ."
9005,Exactly .
9006,"And I was like , well I 've been telling you that Neil ."
9007,Indeed .
9008,So Cool . Cool . that 's mostly the sort of stuff that I 'm spending a lot of time on now . %um
9009,"Well it 'll look good on your C V , your resume ."
9010,so you might as well spend the time .
9011,"Yes , well ,"
9012,"%uh , no , it 's definitely worth doing . %um ,"
9013,and I would have been spending more time on it if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with .
9014,So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park .
9015,Yes .
9016,"yeah , okay ."
9017,yeah .
9018,I mean the thing that i-
9019,this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to .
9020,oh .
9021,"It 's not a question of whether or not , %uh you know , that was easy ,"
9022,it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into .
9023,Exactly .
9024,Exactly .
9025,yeah .
9026,And so the problem is that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into .
9027,yeah .
9028,And unfortunately .
9029,"Well , it 's kind of odd ."
9030,They 've stolen very weird things for the most part .
9031,%hm .
9032,as far
9033,yeah
9034,as a .
9035,"The first time they broke in , what they stole was just bizarre ,"
9036,mostly worthless stuff .
9037,"And , %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre-amplifier of my stereo . Unfortunately , because it 's a nice pre-amplifier ,"
9038,"it has an off board power supply which they did n't steal , which makes the thing that they **stoled** absolutely worthless ."
9039,%huh .
9040,So .
9041,That 's bizarre . Bizarre .
9042,so when they broke in the second time did they steal the %uh offboard amplifier ?
9043,"Actually , no ,"
9044,all they stole the second time was my bike .
9045,%huh .
9046,Which was actually where the major problem came . Exactly . Exactly . yeah . Is that I suddenly had no transportation .
9047,"And so , I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike ,"
9048,and %mm . that cost me a lot of time .
9049,yeah .
9050,Exactly .
9051,"Because ,"
9052,yes
9053,"Spending a lot of time hunting for bikes , and nah well . then getting one purchased , and then having to , you know , go get it and things like that ."
9054,"But , that 's dealt with at least ."
9055,"And so %uh , that 's yeah at least dealt with ."
9056,Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this .
9057,But yeah . yeah .
9058,"At least Well that would make sense during the summer %uh according to the stipulations of my fellowship , I can actually earn money during the summer ."
9059,"But %um , guessed what happened ."
9060,What ?
9061,%um The %um
9062,Again ?
9063,"%um 118.91_120.82_B: Let 's see ,"
9064,two weeks ago
9065,I know Sue is going to Rhode Island .
9066,%eh Right .
9067,Right .
9068,Did she see her mom ?
9069,Yes she did .
9070,And ?
9071,Yes she did .
9072,And ?
9073,"%um , %um , which we had already anticipated that it was going to happen ."
9074,I spoke to her mom on Thursday
9075,%um and I asked her
9076,I said listen
9077,I said %um please come to Shabbat
9078,"things have come to a point where I may have to relinquish my , %uh parenting ."
9079,%uh would you mind %uh taking her back
9080,and she said no .
9081,She said %uh she 'd be more than happy to .
9082,Really ?
9083,This girl has everything in her dreams you know .
9084,"it is as my husband says %uh , %uh al kadir the destiny ."
9085,"Selema I 'm telling you ,"
9086,it is like Allah has just painted the road
9087,and all I had to do was get on it and follow it .
9088,I mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck out of me .
9089,I told mom
9090,"I said mom it is when you believe in Allah , when you have faith and know when you truly give your heart to Allah , only Allah can make the way clear for you ."
9091,%uh .
9092,I believe that by her birthday she will be living with her mother .
9093,Really ?
9094,mhm mhm .
9095,and is she seem like she 's together enough ?
9096,she 's in a two year program .
9097,She 's in the program now .
9098,She 's doing very well .
9099,When I talked to her I 'm talking to her like I 'm talking to you .
9100,I wrote her a letter and told her
9101,I said I feel like I know you even though I never met you .
9102,"They seemed surprised that ,"
9103,I mean most women you lose your baby that 's it .
9104,But almighty God is
9105,You never even get a chance to see them again .
9106,That 's true .
9107,That 's true .
9108,But that 's what she had wrote me .
9109,she said it is just awesome to her what is happening .
9110,yup .
9111,mhm .
9112,aw I 've heard of that .
9113,yup .
9114,So Francis
9115,Did she say how she felt about what had happened ?
9116,No .

9382,So when I 'm still riding the bike she 's completely finished her weight lifting routine .
9383,mhm .
9384,And like I have n't even started mine . mhm . You know

9397,maybe she 'll catch on soon .
9398,"You do burn a lot of calories an hour though , lifting weights ."
9399,uh-huh .
9400,But %uh
9401,yeah
9402,I mean I do n't think you 're going to lose that much .
9403,and also lifting weights at Bally 's means you 're standing on line for as much time as you 're actually lifting .
9404,Really .
9405,yeah .
9406,That 's too bad .
9407,yeah .
9408,So is it really overcrowded ?

9456,oh boy .
9457,Wow .

9566,"To -- -- you know the other thing , the reception ."
9567,I just would n't go .
9568,%mm .

9626,Of course I 'm talking to you .
9627,I can hardly hear you .
9628,oh .
9629,I thought you were talking to somebody else and like put the phone down or something .
9630,I 'm talking to you .
9631,oh .
9632,yeah .
9633,No dad told me that .
9634,oh he did tell you .
9635,It 's all Chilean .
9636,yeah .
9637,yeah .
9638,Walnut Crest or Walnut Creek or -- %mm . -- something like that .
9639,I do n't know .
9640,%mm .
9641,There 's a pretty good sale . %mm . So now we have to keep our eyes open for a champagne sale .
9642,"An- ,"
9643,do you know if Jack called Spencer yet ?
9644,I told him this morning to do it this week .
9645,uh-huh .
9646,And he just keeps forgetting .
9647,yeah .
9648,But o-
9649,How 's he doing ?
9650,Much better .
9651,yeah ?
9652,yeah .
9653,he 's often chipper .
9654,He went for a walk this morning at five seventeen .
9655,Pe-
9656,oh my god .
9657,Is that because he 's not sleeping and
9658,Well because he could n't breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom .
9659,oh .
9660,So I think it 's time to give all the cats a bath .
9661,%mm .
9662,yeah
9663,"and the- ,"
9664,you should do that .
9665,I know .
9666,It 's a two person job though .
9667,I 'll have to get somebody to help me .
9668,%mm . yeah .
9669,%hm .
9670,"But %uh , yeah ,"
9671,it 's still a fairly expensive call
9672,"%uh but it 's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we actually make my parents in law pay it ,"
9673,then it
9674,the Dutch have such high taxes on those
9675,they consider it a luxury to call around the world
9676,so they tax it really high .
9677,Anyway %um
9678,So you guys will be in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth
9679,and you 're going to go to %uh Amsterdam .
9680,"Well I would say is once you 're at a hotel uh-huh %um , why do n't you call me at work and let me know where you are ,"
9681,"and then we can make arrangements that day %um , that I can meet you in Amsterdam ."
9682,"And maybe I 'll come by , public transport ."
9683,It 's probably easier for me to come by public transport in Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest .
9684,mhm .
9685,The streets are small
9686,and there 's no parking .
9687,So I probably will come by public transport
9688,but I do n't know .
9689,We 'll see where you 're staying
9690,%um
9691,and there 's a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff
9692,you can see stuff in Amsterdam
9693,"and %uh since the days are really long ,"
9694,I mean it stays light here till about ten thirty eleven o'clock mhm . at night .
9695,So if you want we can take a ride and go see stuff at night
9696,"and I can take you to some places ,"
9697,we can %uh go see some stuff .
9698,"%um , depends on what you guys want to see ."
9699,So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know .
9700,okay
9701,%um and I 'll sit and talk with Anya about some things that maybe we think that it would be neat for you to see .
9702,So if you do n't have any ideas we 'll just put something together for you .
9703,okay .
9704,%um but yeah
9705,"but I can pick you up th- ,"
9706,you know I 'll probably be there some time around six
9707,"and we can like do a quick dinner or something yeah and go see whatever you want to see ,"
9708,if you want to stay in Amsterdam that 's fine .
9709,"If you want to go %uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of , echte Holland , real Holland and we can do that too ."
9710,Actually I 've been up to Holland before .
9711,Spent about two weeks up there .
9712,yeah .
9713,"So %um ,"
9714,but that was years and years ago .
9715,"With your parents when your father was stationed over here , right ?"
9716,yeah .
9717,But we got to see Den Haag and places like that too which we 're obviously not going to see this time .
9718,But %um
9719,has Kim been here before ?
9720,"And , an-"
9721,No .
9722,oh good .
9723,But then again I 'm not sure that Kim would be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters and you know all that kind of stuff . those military things .
9724,Would you be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters again .
9725,No . Not really .
9726,yeah .
9727,I did n't think so .
9728,Somehow I had this feeling that the military taste had been beaten out of you .
9729,yep .
9730,"I 'm ,"
9731,"the mil- ,"
9732,I ca n't say too bad things about the military though .
9733,They still have my goods
9734,and they 'll probably hold them hostage .
9735,And they own my body and soul for like another four years
9736,so I just got to pray that they
9737,oh do they ?
9738,yeah .
9739,I owe four years in active reserve time .
9740,aw great .
9741,Do they do that to everyone ?
9742,"Milo , get out of there"
9743,yeah -- -- %eh everyone %uh who has n't been like you were
9744,you went through like the thirty six two process .
9745,mhm .
9746,So you do n't have it
9747,"but yeah if you just separate normally and you have n't served at least eight years , then you owe it ."
9748,And that 's one of those things they just never tell you up front .
9749,No .
9750,They never said anything
9751,I figured there was something like that because
9752,And I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too .
9753,So .
9754,yeah .
9755,I mean that 's the military .
9756,I have my discharge papers and everything
9757,uh-huh .
9758,"and I 've said that yeah I will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they call me back for those , but they 're going to have to pay my trip back to the states . because there 's no bases in Holland and I 'm not going to pay out of my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them ."
9759,"If they want me they can pay ,"
9760,bring me back active duty and pay me for the day if they 're going to drag me off somewhere .
9761,"But %uh , first they have to find me ."
9762,"yeah , that 's the other"
9763,"it was i- ,"
9764,if you 're in another country I mean and you 're not planning on coming back to the U S what are they going to do even if you do n't .
9765,yeah .
9766,Well I mean I 'm still American citizen
9767,and I still would like to be welcome in my own country .
9768,Although g-
9769,"%uh I mean if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here I probably would n't be a horror either ,"
9770,but %uh yeah
9771,right now I mean I do want to keep my American citizenship
9772,so .
9773,I kind of want to
9774,Are you going to become a dual citizen ?
9775,What 's that ?
9776,Are you going to try and become a dual citizen ?
9777,Have dual citizenship ?
9778,"You ca n't do that ,"
9779,"%um , the only way to be a dual citizen is if you 're born in a foreign country"
9780,like if I were born in Holland and then had American parents . Then I could be a dual citizen .
9781,But you ca n't
9782,If I would to ask to become a citizen in Holland I would automatically lose my American citizenship .
9783,"As far as the Americans are concerned , yeah ."
9784,yeah .
9785,The Dutch could care less .
9786,The Dutch would say fine
9787,"want to be a dual citizen ,"
9788,"that 's fine ,"
9789,but the Americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship .
9790,I mean it 's kind of stupid .
9791,yeah .
9792,So I 'm an expatriot .
9793,An American expatriot .
9794,An American living abroad .
9795,I still have to file a tax return .
9796,Do you ?
9797,yeah .
9798,But my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income is tax free .
9799,Good grief .
9800,As long as I do n't bring it back to the states .
9801,Good grief .
9802,"I R S for you , %huh ?"
9803,yeah .
9804,oh they want their share .
9805,They want their piece of meat .
9806,"But all foreign taxes are deductible ,"
9807,and my taxes here are fifty percent of income .
9808,"So the taxes here are so much higher that , yeah I would never have to worry about it ."
9809,"Unless you became C E O of the company then maybe like a thousand dollars would be taxable , right ?"
9810,yeah .
9811,Somehow it raises a small amount .
9812,the problem 's going to %uh be Anya 's American salary is taxable here and at fifty percent
9813,so we 're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary .
9814,aw .
9815,Some amount that has to be deducted a certain amount
9816,"and the amount we pay the American government is deductible ,"
9817,but we 'll still owe some taxes .
9818,"Th- ,"
9819,see I do n't know how it works .
9820,we 're going to be in need of some sort of accountant do it cause I have no clue how that all works .
9821,They do n't have the Quicken Dutch version ?
9822,yeah .
9823,"%ah , you know I would n't trust it because it 's so complicated with this international garbage or else the Turbo Tax with the Dutch modules . that I just would n't trust it ."
9824,"I do n't know , %eh ."
9825,yeah .
9826,So complicated when you 're dealing with a Dutch tax form .
9827,Anya had to read it
9828,and Anya and her father did n't understand the damn thing .
9829,How am I supposed to understand it ?
9830,"I 'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with ,"
9831,Oregon you pay state tax
9832,Washington you do n't .
9833,I 'm looking forward to that cause %uh
9834,yeah
9835,but You 'll be a student
9836,"so you ,"
9837,I mean you 're
9838,what is your income ?
9839,"oh , well"
9840,"See I think y- , %um ,"
9841,it 'll probably be about five thousand dollars the portion of this year that I 'm in Oregon
9842,and then next year it 'll be eleven thousand .
9843,yeah .
9844,But I mean you 're below the poverty line at that level .
9845,yeah .
9846,So I mean any income that y-
9847,Well
9848,But then I 've already made say like fifteen thousand or whatever here in Washington
9849,but
9850,That should be non taxable out of state income .
9851,It should
9852,but you know it 's not going to be a fun tax return year .
9853,I had that when I went into the military .
9854,But then again .
9855,"I had Kans- ,"
9856,I had to file three taxes .
9857,"I had to file Georgia , Kansas yeah and then my federal ."
9858,So .
9859,"Well , %um actually I think this phone call 's just about to end cause it 's only half an hour ,"
9860,but %um
9861,So let 's see .
9862,"I 'll give you a call when we arrive in h- ,"
9863,"or maybe I 'll just call you when we get in Holland just to let you know we 're there ,"
9864,so if we get in the eighteenth or the nineteenth and then call you back %um when we get to a hotel or something like that .
9865,okay that 's a great idea .
9866,as soon as you get into Holland and get yourself settled you can call me
9867,"and %uh if it 's at night , just call Anya 's parents"
9868,okay so
9869,and remember that if you dial in Holland you need to add a zero
9870,so like right now okay it 's one eight one zero area code .
9871,"If you dial in Holland , it 's zero one eight one zero . okay in Holland"
9872,and then yeah you can just call up
9873,"if it 's during the work hours , fine , call me at work ."
9874,"If not , call Anya 's parents if you do n't have a new phone number for me ."
9875,"And if you do , I 'll send it by email okay if I get it before this weekend"
9876,we 'll email you something
9877,but if you do n't get email then just call Anya 's parents
9878,"If we have a phone by then , they 'll be able to give you the number"
9879,okay
9880,and just remember to ask for her mother .
9881,"and it 's Goode , right"
9882,Bode
9883,Bode
9884,Bode as in abode
9885,abode
9886,minus the A
9887,okay
9888,great
9889,and
9890,yeah
9891,and I think %uh %uh it 's not Frau
9892,%uh %ah %uh It 's Mifrau
9893,is
9894,it 's Frau in German
9895,it 's Frau
9896,mhm
9897,and then Dutch it 's Mifrau
9898,I 'll probably never remember that
9899,so hope they wo n't be offended .
9900,nah do n't worry about it .
9901,You can just call her Missus
9902,you can just call her Missus and speak English to her .
9903,she understands
9904,just talk slowly and clearly .
9905,okay
9906,and once you 're in Holland the line will be really clear .
9907,I mean the phones here are pretty good . once you 're in the country .
9908,It 's just these to America
9909,it 's always kind of iffy
9910,The hot dialogue ... that went on between -LSB- -LSB- -LSB- Saddam Hussein and Rumsfeld -RSB- -RSB- -RSB- at the airport prison .
9911,Collaborator
9912,Details of the minutes of the meeting between Rumsfeld and Saddam Hussein at the Airport Prison ...
9913,Washington offers Saddam a television appearance to stop the Resistance in return for his freedom .
9914,Baghdad - INA - from Aras An Nasiri
9915,Minutes of the dialogue between Saddam and Rumsfeld from trusted American sources .
9916,What follows is the text of the minutes
9917,At the start of the conversation President Saddam appeared extremely calm .
9918,"Perhaps he was surprised that his guest was Rumsfeld , but he did not appear at all nervously tense ."
9919,"Rumsfeld began the conversation by saying Rumsfeld : I came to meet you to negotiate the situation in Iraq ; we have made contact with some of your followers inside and outside Iraq , they have advised us to listen to you ."
9920,Saddam Hussein : So what do you want ?
9921,"Your forces have occupied the territory of the proud Iraq , you have brought down the governing regime without a legal support ,"
9922,"you have assaulted the sovereignty of an independent free sovereign country ,"
9923,you have committed crimes which history will record against you as evidence of your blood - stained civilization .
9924,So what do you want after all that ?
9925,"Rumsfeld -LRB- trying to suppress his anger -RRB- : What 's past is past , I came especially to make you a clear and specific offer and I want to hear from you a clear and definite answer ."
9926,Saddam Hussein -LRB- mockingly -RRB- : I thought you had come to apologize and restore power to the Iraqis .
9927,"Rumsfeld : We have nothing to apologize for , you constituted a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction and practiced dictatorship over your people and so it was only natural that we extended our hand to the people of Iraq to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for more than three decades ."
9928,"Saddam Hussein : I know that you are ignorant of history , and I know that your president is no less ignorant but it seems that you have continued to lie to the extent that you now believe yourselves ."
9929,"If "" by our neighbors "" you mean the Zionist Entity then we did indeed form a danger , we were preparing to liberate our ravished territory in Palestine ."
9930,This is the wish of every Arab person and not just every Iraqi .
9931,"For this is Arab land and its people are Arab , and the Zionists are the ones who occupied the land and came to us from all over the world with your help , yours , and that of the old imperial powers ."
9932,"But if you meant Kuwait , I want to ask you ."
9933,Did you withdraw from Kuwait or not ?
9934,Rumsfeld : These are security issues .
9935,"Besides , there are security agreements between us and Kuwait and the other Gulf states ... we came at their request to protect them from your threats ."
9936,Saddam Hussein : Is n't funny that the wolf is being entrusted with the sheep ?
9937,The people of Kuwait are an Arab people .
9938,"And Kuwait is Iraqi territory , therefore I ask you to read history carefully , although I am certain that you wo n't comprehend it ."
9939,"Rumsfeld : Stop from this drivel , I am offering you ..."
9940,"Saddam Hussein -LRB- interrupting -RRB- : Before you offer me your rotten goods , I ask you did you find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not ?"
9941,"Rumsfeld -LRB- disconcerted -RRB- : We have n't found them yet , but we will surely find them one day ."
9942,Do you deny that you had intentions to manufacture a nuclear bomb ?
9943,"Saddam Hussein : We have had no weapons of mass destruction since 1991 , we were truthful when we spoke with the international inspection mission , we were truthful in our letters to Kofi Annan , you knew these facts but you were looking for any pretext to occupy Iraq and topple its legitimate authority ."
9944,"Rumsfeld : The Iraqis received us with overwhelming happiness and welcomed us , because of the practices of your bloody regime over the course of all those years in which you governed Iraq ."
9945,"Saddam Hussein : Please , Mr Rumsfeld , enough lying ."
9946,"You are the ones who have opened the floodgates to cascades of blood on the soil of Iraq , you plotted against us and got some traitors to take over power over the land of the great Iraq ."
9947,"Rumsfeld : Those you are calling traitors have been chosen by the Iraqi people as their leaders by democratic means and free elections , something that did not take place during your rule over the country ."
9948,Saddam Hussein : I found out that you had come with a troop of traitors led by Talabani -LRB- laughs mockingly -RRB- .
9949,Great Iraq is being ruled by Talabani and Jaafari .
9950,Is n't this ridiculous ?
9951,"Then , which elections are you talking about ?"
9952,Is it permissible for what you call free elections to be held under your occupation of our country ?
9953,"Mr Rumsfeld , we have learned from history that the occupier will not bring except his assistants and lackeys , and you want , after all that , to convince me that the people of Iraq enjoy freedom and democracy ?"
9954,You are truly delusional .
9955,Rumsfeld -LRB- barely able to contain his anger -RRB- : You are isolated and do not know the facts of what is happening on the outside .
9956,"The Iraqi people have been liberated from your oppression , if they saw you or any of your men in the street they would kill you ."
9957,Saddam Hussein : I challenge you to announce your location in Iraq if you can .
9958,If the Iraqi resistance found out your whereabouts you would not be able to get out alive .
9959,"I want to give a word of advice to your "" dumb "" president , you must pass it on to him , and it is that he should save what is left of his soldiers ."
9960,Death surrounds them everywhere and history will not be merciful to him .
9961,Rumsfeld : I came to talk with you about the terrorist operations which your men are instigating and carrying out .
9962,Your men have recently carried out an ignoble operation aimed at the Abu Ghraib prison where they injured and killed more than fifty Americans and also killed a number of prisoners imprisoned under various charges .
9963,Your men are employing terrorists from all parts of the world and they are threatening the democratic process in Iraq .
9964,Saddam Hussein : What is it you want exactly ?
9965,"Rumsfeld : I am making you one offer , that you are released and choose for yourself a place of exile in any country you wish on the condition that you appear on television to announce your condemnation of the terrorism and to ask your men to stop these practices ."
9966,Saddam Hussein : Have you obtained the consent of your president to this offer ?
9967,"Rumsfeld : Yes , this offer was agreed to at a session in which the President , his deputy , the Secretary of State and the head of the CIA took part and I was commissioned to inform you of this offer ."
9968,Saddam Hussein : It is a very low price .
9969,Rumsfeld -LRB- excited -RRB- : We are prepared to include elements close to you in power .
9970,Saddam Hussein : And what else ?
9971,Rumsfeld : We will offer you considerable financial assistance and will look after your and your family 's security in the country you choose .
9972,Saddam Hussein : Do you want to hear my conditions ?
9973,"Rumsfeld : Yes , that would be nice ."
9974,"Saddam Hussein -LRB- in language beaming with pride and arrogance -RRB- I want you first of all .. to set me a timetable for the withdrawal from Iraq that your government will commit itself to it in front of the world , and for you to begin the withdrawal operation immediately ."
9975,"I ask , secondly , .. for the immediate release of all the Iraqi and Arab detainees in the prisons you have set up or in those where you have shackled the freedom of tens of thousands of honorable Iraqis ."
9976,"Thirdly , I ask you .. for the undertaking that full compensation will be offered for the material losses which the Iraqi people have suffered through your aggression on our country since the Mother of All Battles in 1991 until this present day ."
9977,I will accept the assistance of an international and Arab committee in estimating these losses .
9978,"Fourthly , I ask that you produce the money which your men looted from the treasuries of Iraq and its oil especially this criminal Bremmer and his henchmen from the traitors and renegades ."
9979,"And , fifthly , I ask for .. the return of the antiquities which you have stolen and handed over to the antiquities mafia , for these are priceless treasures because they bear the history of Iraq and its civilization ."
9980,Your country is no older than a few hundred years .
9981,"True , you do not have neither a civilization nor history , but all that can not excuse your thefts and your hatred of Iraq 's civilization and Iraq 's riches ."
9982,"Sixthly , I ask that you hand me the weapons of mass destruction if you have found them , bring back to life all the martyrs you have killed , and return the integrity of the glorious Iraqi women which you have robbed ."
9983,Rumsfeld : Is this some kind of joke ?
9984,"Saddam Hussein : No , this is just the bitter truth , which you know very well ."
9985,"Mr Rumsfeld , you have committed the greatest crime in history against a peaceful Arab state .. we met each other in the eighties ."
9986,Do you remember your offers ?
9987,"Rumsfeld : Let us forget the past , we are in the process of re-evaluating our position on you and on the many forces which displayed hostility to us in the past ."
9988,We have decided to hold a dialogue with the moderate Islamists .
9989,We have no objection to their arrival in power via the ballot box .
9990,"But more importantly , we have decided to open channels of dialogue with "" terrorist "" organizations such as Hamas and Jihad and Hezbollah who are loyal to Iran , and other fundamentalist organizations in the whole world ."
9991,And we even have a project to get in touch with the Taliban movement in Afghanistan to discuss its participation in power in return for disarming .
9992,Saddam Hussein : Then you have begun to re-think your mistaken methodology .
9993,"Rumsfeld : It is a natural development of things , we are trying to spread democracy to all countries and all autocratic movements ."
9994,Saddam Hussein : You would be successful if you would tell the truth .
9995,I know the reality of your goals .
9996,"If you were really sincere you would begin straightaway , you and your allies , to withdraw from Iraq , and you also have to back down from your position of supporting Israel ."
9997,I know that your president is stubborn and obstinate and not sincere .
9998,Rumsfeld : He is a democratically elected president and not a bloodthirsty ruler like you .
9999,Saddam Hussein : Terrorism is your trade and deceit your method .
10000,Rumsfeld : This proposal is an historic chance for you .
10001,We will release you and will consult with you in everything concerning governance issues in Iraq .
10002,If you reject this offer then the opportunity will not be repeated .
10003,"Saddam Hussein : I am not looking for opportunities , I am not looking for a way to save my neck from the gallows which you have set up for the whole of Iraq ."
10004,If I wanted that I would have accepted the Russian offer and saved my two sons and my grandson from martyrdom .
10005,"I do not know what the fate of my family and my daughters and grandchildren is , but be sure that I am concerned for every Iraqi citizen and the future of the Great Iraq more than I am concerned with myself and my family ."
10006,"You have previously made me an offered before this through your men that I say the weapons of mass destruction were smuggled to Syria , and you said that the price was my release ."
10007,I refused and I repeat the refusal once again .
10008,"Rumsfeld : I do not want a refusal from you , I want you to think about it ."
10009,"We are currently re-evaluating our positions , we want to stop the bloodshed on both sides and so our offer is made from the point of strength and not from the point of weakness ."
10010,We asked Jalal Talabani to make a statement in which he denies any intention to execute you as a sign of good will from us .
10011,We are ready to review our position completely on the entire political process in Iraq and we will hold a dialogue with you and with your men on this matter .
10012,Saddam Hussain : Are you ready to withdraw or not ?
10013,"Rumsfeld : We could discuss re-deployment , our forces have prepared bases for long - term stay ."
10014,We could withdraw from the streets and the towns but we will stay in the bases for a some time .
10015,Saddam Hussein : Then you want a new lackey to be added to this queue of lackeys .
10016,"No Mr. Rumsfeld .. do n't forget that you are speaking with Saddam Hussein , the president of the state of Iraq ."
10017,Rumsfeld : But you have lost power .
10018,Saddam Hussein : I have only honor left and honor can not be sold or bought .
10019,Rumsfeld : But life has a value that is priceless .
10020,"Saddam Hussein : There is no value to a life without honor , and you robbed Iraq of its honor when you desecrated its land ."
10021,We will get our honor back whether Saddam Hussein survives or becomes a martyr .
10022,"Rumsfeld : Your followers with whom we entered into a dialogue have told us that the decisions will be yours , first and last ."
10023,Were they expecting your reaction ?
10024,"Saddam Hussein : For sure , they know that Saddam Hussain can not back down at the expense of his nation and its honor ."
10025,Rumsfeld : History will hold you responsible for the blood which is being spilled in Iraq .
10026,"Saddam Hussein : On the contrary , history will judge you because of your crimes .."
10027,"I warned you in advance when I said to you that you will commit suicide on the walls of Baghdad , and here you are paying the price ."
10028,I ask you to go to London and read the records of the British Foreign Office to find out some of the characteristics of the struggle of the Iraqi people against your British friends whose mistakes you are repeating and making them participate with you .
10029,The Iraqi people are an obstinate people and do not fear death ... the Resistance is stronger than you imagine and therefore I predict there 'll be more .

10036,The Amateur
10037,Rumsfeld : We have nothing to apologize for .
10038,You were a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction .
10039,And you practiced dictatorship over your people .
10040,and so it was natural that we extended our hand to the people of Iraq to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for more than three decades .
10041,And did Rumsfeld free Iraq from dangers ?
10042,He is really delusional ...
10043,I have reservations about what appeared in these minutes ... because I think it unlikely that what happened at that meeting would leak out this easily ...
10044,And I do not believe that Rumsfeld would meet Saddam unless Saddam himself made signs ... the important thing is that the expression quoted above tells of a reality that can not be but accepted ...

10073,Saddam 's last days and what is said he was like
10074,Bu Thari
10075,What we know about Saddam Hussein in recent years is that he had changed a lot .
10076,"He had Islamic tendecies and acts which many Iraqis mentioned , saying that Saddam supported to a great extent the building of mosques centers for memorizing Koran , and charities , and the dancer 's punishment was death ."
10077,He had many works .
10078,But some explained his Islamic tendency by saying that he was currying favor with the Sunnis as if they were reading his mind .
10079,"I have followed Saddam Hussein , especially in recent years , and I noticed about him was that there was religion but there was injustice and coarseness ."
10080,And his punishment was unjust .
10081,"I mean , for example , the dancer would be killed after second offence ."
10082,"I did not expect anyone to kill the dancer unless good would come of it , but like the most idiots his aim was correct but the method was wrong ."
10083,"Another example - after his son Udai harmed the Iraqi people and attacked women and other matters , Saddam ordered him to be killed ."
10084,"And in fact he was fired on but survived miraculously , after being hit with several fatal shots some of which hit his spine ."
10085,"This is a sign that there was good in him otherwise he would not have ordered the killing of his son , his own child ."
10086,But he was not a scholar nor feared in God .
10087,"I myself heard from some people who were in Iraq about the things that Saddam Hussein used to do , and could not be reasonably done by anyone other than a good Moslem To the extent that many said of his actions that they were only to gain favor amongst the Sunnis and the religious ."
10088,But we judge by the appearances and his end was in line with the appearance .
10089,"In his last days during the fall of Baghdad and his disappearance , an old woman or man said on TV on al - Jazeera channel that he was hiding in her house and had had his prayer mat with him and was always praying and reading the Koran ."
10090,"Do we say no , this is hypocrisy ?"
10091,Bear in mind that many have said that Saddam prayed regularly especially after he was put in prison by the Rafida and their masters .
10092,Some of those who said that he was always praying and reading the Koran are the Christians who visited him in his prison cell .
10093,"Finally , during his hanging , the Rafida tried to distract him and keep him from saying the Creed before his death ."
10094,They were trying everything they could but we say that God made him steadfast for the whole world to see that he died acknowledging God .
10095,"The Rafida were shouting provocative words such as Muqtada and al - Sadr so that he would lose control and curse them , then they would have killed him ."
10096,So they could show the clip in which there is cursing and insults from Saddam and cut the rest .
10097,However he remained steadfast in saying the creed and was killed whilst saying it .
10098,I believe that this could n't have happened without God making him steadfast otherwise God would not have made him steadfast in it .
10099,"As one of the sheikhs says , many people when they were supposed to say the creed and were being dictated the creed by those present would murmur "" Did love see drunkards ? """
10100,"Other people say , I have not said it while I was alive and you want me to say it when I am dying ... the truth is what is apparent ."
10101,But Saddam Hussein was reasonable in that he repented and turned to his creator who receives the repentance from his slave .
10102,And he committed himself to the worship of God . And remained loyal to God .
10103,I ask God to have mercy on him and to forgive him and to give him an ample dwelling in his paradise and guide the rest of the Ba'thists .

10114,"The Islam Diary : A leader of the Shiite death squads in Sadr City , east of Baghdad , acknowledged that the Mahdi Army militia was involved in killing operations of Arab Sunni men after kidnapping them , despite their relatives having paid the blood money demanded by the hostage - takers in return for their being freed ."
10115,"Speaking at the same time about an Iranian role in the financing and support of the war of genocide against the Sunnis . "" Fadil "" , a commander in the Mahdi Army tells how he had followed three Arab Sunni men for a period of some weeks and detained them when they were crossing the Karada bridge , after having informed an Iraqi army road block close to the area that he was pursuing "" terrorists "" , then attacked the car of the group in question ."
10116,"He also told the British Guardian that he took the three men to Sadr City where his group had interrogated them then executed them , indicating that the members of the Mahdi Army usually demanded a ransom from the families of the hostages in return for freeing their relatives , and would liquidate them anyway after they receive the ransom ."
10117,"The newspaper quoted another commander in the Mahdi Army as saying ; "" We have taken 10 Sunnis hostages , we will get a ransom for five of them , then we will kill them all . In every major hostage - taking operation we get 50 thousand dollars , "" and he considered it to be the best business a person could be running in Baghdad now !"
10118,"The newspaper described "" Fadil "" as a valuable commander to this squad because he is a Shiite who grew up in the Sunni area south of Baghdad ."
10119,He speaks in the Sunni dialect and carries an identity card from the Yusufiyah Sunni village .
10120,"He was quoted as saying : "" I can enter the Sunni areas without anyone knowing that I am a Shiite . """
10121,It pointed out that Fadil and the likes are responsible for the dozens of corpses which are being found daily in Baghdad .
10122,This means that the Baghdad security plan will not be successful unless the Americans control squads such as these to put breaks on the civil war .
10123,""" Fadil "" was quoted as saying that the Mahdi Army is resorting in its operations to reinforcements from Iraqi army units commanded by its members or sympathizers , and confirmed that all the police belong to the Shiite militia ."
10124,He added that the Mahdi Army is receiving logistic and military support from Iran and that they are not encountering any problems in getting weapons through to Sadr City because they usually present a letter to each of the checkpoints they pass through .

10186,Eliminate the personal income tax -LRB- Reproduced from Yueguang blog -RRB- .
10187,Dift Wu
10188,"Official data confirm that in 2004 the total personal income tax for the country amounted to approximately 181 billion , of which 65 % came from the working class , and only 10 % came from the wealthy ."
10189,"Clearly the personal income tax policy has too little effect on controlling wealth accumulation by the rich , and too little impact on improving the quality of life of wage earners ."
10190,"While this type of tax in China has no effect on regulating the income gap or on "" taking from the rich to help the poor , "" neither is it beneficial in expanding the working class ."
10191,"If this tax continues to be collected , it will be working against the original intention behind the income tax ."
10192,Clearly the necessity for the personal income tax needs to be challenged .
10193,"I propose eliminating the personal income tax just as the agricultural tax was eliminated , to give people an opportunity to prosper ."
10194,"If we think in terms of humanizing the system , i.e. , helping the poor by letting poor people get rich , we should give low - and moderate - income people a chance to improve and raise the quality of their lives ; the threshold for China 's personal income tax should be at least tripled from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month , i.e. , to 6400 yuan per person ."
10195,"That would take it to a minimally humanized level , and then we could really talk about "" people first . """
10196,"With a threshold below this level , the poor will always be poor ."
10197,"Yesterday CCTV presented a program on adjustment of the personal income tax , emphasized that the main goal of the adjustment was to "" take from the rich "" and let poor people get wealthy ."
10198,"If we really want to give poor people a chance to get wealthy , the threshold for the personal income tax should be tripled ."
10199,"With anything under this threshold , the poor will have no chance to get rich ."
10200,"And if we 're looking at it in terms of "" taking from the rich , "" the problem to be adjusted is definitely not whether or not to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for distributing China 's social national income , namely how to eliminate the "" unreported income . """
10201,"The income of the vast majority of China 's rich people is unreported income , and unreported income is a problem that Chinese society will not be able to solve for quite a long time to come ; it is a characteristic of China , an uncontrollable black hole in China 's social oversight ."
10202,This is far from being a tax problem ; it is a deeper systemic problem .
10203,"If China 's personal income tax can not achieve the effect of helping the poor to become rich , neither can it control the excessive incomes of the wealthy , so what is it we expect this personal income tax to do ?"
10204,"It would be better to eliminate it in one fell swoop , as we did with the agricultural tax ."
10205,Below are some of the main reasons :
10206,1. China 's income tax can not become a tool for keeping the poor perpetually poor ; it can not become a social tool that keeps on producing a penniless proletariat .
10207,In China the primary function of the income tax is to increase the state 's financial revenues ; it is not to regulate the income gap .
10208,"In 2004 China 's income taxes amounted to approximately 180 billion , accounting for about 6 % of the state 's financial revenues ."
10209,"But of this 180 billion , about 65 % , or 117 billion , was paid by the working class ."
10210,Less than 10 % was paid by the wealthy .
10211,In China more than 90 % of the people who depend on fully declared total earnings for a living are urban poor .
10212,"These poor people , who struggle just to pay for the necessities of life , their children 's education , old age , illness and death , also have to pay income tax ."
10213,"In all of China 's cities now , anyone with a monthly income of 2000 yuan or less is considered poor ."
10214,"If a husband and wife have a total monthly work income of 2000 yuan , and if they pay 33 % income tax on anything over 1500 yuan , they have a disposable income of only 1670 yuan ."
10215,"A household like this can not even continue bearing basic living expenses , and their standard of living will decline ."
10216,"And should anyone in the household get sick and have to go to the hospital , the family may well find itself in an economic crisis ."
10217,"And if a family like this wants to buy its own home , that will basically be impossible ."
10218,"And if only one person in a three - person family is employed , the family will have a very difficult life ."
10219,"But even so , they have to pay 165 yuan in income tax ."
10220,"Clearly , if our income tax threshold is set at 1500 yuan , our society is destined always to produce a proletariat , always to deny hope to the poor or to the masses of ever getting rich ."
10221,"Our production relations are no different from the production relations in Marx 's "" Das Kapital , "" constantly reproducing a proletariat who can only rely on selling its labor to make a living ."
10222,"In short , if the personal income tax threshold is set lower than 6400 yuan , it will be ineffective in helping the poor get rich ."
10223,"Conversely , if the threshold is too low , it will cleanly and quickly inhibit the ability of poor people to get rich ."
10224,2. The personal income tax is absolutely unable to control the accumulation of wealth by the rich .
10225,"We should not entertain any illusions that China 's income tax can in any way regulate income distribution , much less that it can "" take from the rich and give to the poor . """
10226,"In Chinese society , 20 % of the people hold 80 % of social wealth , and 80 % of the people are able to use only 20 % of the social wealth to suffer through their lives ."
10227,"In China , freedom , human rights , democracy , happiness and all the other most effective benefits that society can offer refer only to 20 % of the people ."
10228,"Western countries that attack China for not having human rights , democracy and freedom are quite wrong ; these 20 % of upper - class citizens have broader human rights , democracy and freedom than do Western societies ."
10229,"When God looks at China , he sees only these 20 % ; the other 80 % he ca n't see clearly ."
10230,"The income of the vast majority of these 20 , of upper - class citizens in China is basically unreported income ; the proportion of their income that comes from fully declared earnings is a negligible part of their wealth ."
10231,Only if China eliminated unreported income would the income tax have an effect on rich people .
10232,"And if China wants to eliminate unreported income , to date there is no sign of that , and there is no compelling evidence to explain when China might eliminate unreported income ."
10233,"Anyhow , it is not something our generation will see ."
10234,That is why the income tax has no effect on regulating the wealth of China 's rich people .
10235,It does however have a highly restrictive effect on the ability of poor people to get rich .
10236,A very simple explanation is that poor people are all wage earners who rely on fully declared wages for their living ; they do not have unreported income .
10237,"Fully 100 % of their income falls within the income - tax field of vision , so they ca n't escape even if they wanted to ."
10238,"Add to this the fact that the threshold is under the level required to meet the necessary expenditures to maintain the basic necessities of life , and the poor are completely stymied ."
10239,""" Dragons give birth to dragons , phoenixes to phoenixes ; the son of a bandit will live in a cave . """
10240,""" The children of poor people are always poor . """
10241,"With the previous 800 yuan income tax threshold , if it were strictly enforced , 80 % of beggars would have to pay ."
10242,"With a threshold set below 5000 yuan , this generation of poor people need not think about buying a home or driving a car ."
10243,They will always be poor .
10244,"Of course , many children of poor people are able to get rich , but this came about because the parents struggled harder , tightening their belts and "" skimping on food and clothing "" for themselves ."
10245,"Now how many university students who have received acceptance notifications are unable to enroll , and how many enrolled university students from the countryside have parents who are living through unimaginably hard times ?"
10246,"In Western countries , the personal income tax is the most effective means of controlling excessively high incomes among the rich ."
10247,"But these are countries ruled by law , where official income is all recorded , citizen 's incomes are fully transparent , and therefore the personal income tax can easily achieve the effect of regulating income distribution ."
10248,"The situation in China is not like that ; if the personal income tax has an effect , it 's to increase financial revenues , and it has absolutely no income - regulating effect ."
10249,3. Eliminating the income tax will benefit peasants .
10250,The vast majority of China 's 900 million peasants are unable to reach the income level for paying income tax .
10251,"But the peasants have contractual land , they have a low - consumption rural lifestyle and conditions , and they have basic housing ."
10252,"But if people in the cities do n't have money , everything is a struggle ."
10253,"If they go shopping for food by bike , they have to pay 20 cents for parking ."
10254,They ca n't not pay the rent or they 'll have to sleep on the street .
10255,"In terms of macroeconomic law , the distribution of wealth in Chinese society is set at 2/8 , with the 20 % of wealthy people holding 80 % of the social wealth , and the 80 % of poor people holding just 20 % of the social wealth ."
10256,"The personal income tax threshold is too low , the urban population is too large , and the population participating in the 20 % that goes to peasants is even greater , so the peasants ultimately have to get a reduced share of this 20 % ."
10257,"If we eliminate the personal income tax , the number of poor people in the cities will be reduced , and the people participating in the peasant struggle for this 20 % will be reduced , which will benefit the peasants ."
10258,In China the wealthy will always hold 80 % of the social wealth ; there has never been a softhearted rich person .
10259,4. This will really be beneficial in establishing a soft - landing market economy system .
10260,"In recent years China 's rate of state financial growth has been higher than economic growth ; this is a highly abnormal phenomenon , and in terms of economic theory it is highly adverse for sustained , healthy growth of the national economy ."
10261,The blood has all been pumped out of the national economy ; it 's like eating up all the seeds sown in the spring .
10262,The proportion of financial revenues from the personal income tax is about 6 % .
10263,"If we cancel out this 6 % , we can slow down financial growth ."
10264,"And in the Chinese economic cycle , excessive financial investment is not a good thing for economic growth and the establishment of a true market economy system ."
10265,"Compared to market investment , the efficiency of financial investment is less than half ."
10266,"And when there is too much financial investment , corruption is everywhere , all the time ."
10267,5. It promotes the establishment of a harmonious society .
10268,"Chinese and foreign history amply demonstrates that a harmonious society is an olive - shaped society : the distribution of numbers of poor , middle - class and wealthy people making up the society is small at either end and larger in the middle , with 40 % or more of the society being middle class ."
10269,"Chinese society is 80 % poor people , 20 % wealthy ; there is no stable middle class , or it floats between the lower levels of the wealthy and the upper end of the poor and is highly unstable ."
10270,"There is no way this "" 2/8 "" social structure can establish a harmonious society ."
10271,Eliminating the personal income tax to accumulate wealth for the people will be beneficial in producing and nourishing a middle class and will promote the creation of a harmonious society .
10272,"In short , if our personal income tax policy can not help the poor get rich , and is unable to limit the excessive increase in wealth among the rich , then it is better not to have this kind of personal income tax ."
10273,"We need to adopt this kind of strategic insight when we consider this matter , so as to benefit the country and the people ."
10274,This essay is dedicated to all the hardworking people of the world .

10278,Advice to Wu Jinglian and Others : Killing the Father -- Does You No Good ! .
10279,-- Some Thoughts on the Attitude of Benign Inheritance towards Social Reform .
10280,"A glance at the title , people with a little political sensitivity may roughly understand the core topic of this article : the rule of benign interaction between planned economy and market economy , and between public ownership and private ownership -- because only their relationships are those between a father and a son , and it is only between them are there different conflicts involving "" human relations , "" "" rules "" and "" science , "" as well as bloody wrestling between classes , factions and individuals on the basis of morality and interests ."
10281,"Comparing planned economy and public ownership to a father is tantamount to comparing market economy and private ownership to a son , which holds water principally and historically no matter you put it this way or another ."
10282,"This is because the former two given "" fatherhood "" are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and institution of the socialist new China , while the latter two dubbed "" son "" in this article -- are indeed the ideological outcomes derived after the death of China 's founder Comrade Mao Zedong under tremendous international and domestic political pressures on planned economy and public ownership , which grew into today 's para-system after about 30 years of reform and opening up ."
10283,"Regarding this , the factual development process of political civilization that the Marxist ideology has been increasingly marginalized over the past 30 years or so is a strong evidence ."
10284,"By sorting out the essence of the above historical background and conceptual relationships , we will have a pretty thorough , comprehensive and systematic knowledge framework about the benign inevitable trends and development guidelines of the future society dependent on the rule of society , so that the associated impression captured may be more concrete ."
10285,"Regarding this , my standpoint is : because the socialism underpinned by planned economy , public ownership and the people 's democratic dictatorship is indeed a really "" fresh "" systemic thing for China in the mid and late 20th century -- without a model or sufficient experience or theories to refer to , no matter how scientific its kernel is , it is hard not to have certain superficial and local problems ."
10286,"However , this should not provide an excuse to overthrow it by fair means or foul , as he is our father and the common choice of millions of laboring people ."
10287,"The fact that it "" finally became our national character and main system after over half a century of international and domestic political transformation "" is a stronger proof that it is the milestone for a new civilization resulted from the blood and sweat of thousands of proletarian revolutionary martyrs ."
10288,"Therefore , no matter from the perspective of average citizens or from the standpoint of the founder of the new government , we should respect and develop her on the basis of inheritance , innovation and improvement ."
10289,Is my opinion above correct ?
10290,"I believe you will naturally obtain a relatively fair and just conclusion if you could understand and treat the above - mentioned "" father "" system and "" son "" system with impartiality and sufficient goodwill ."
10291,"For example , based on the existing institutional cultural heritage in the human history , we could see : the "" father "" system mentioned herein has the majority in mind or it is established in the fundamental and long - term interests of the majority , as well as the need for sustainable and sound development of the country , the nation , and the overall society -- while the "" son "" system mentioned herein is ignorant and sick in the company of such behavioral characteristics as exploitation , fraudulence , pernicious influence and robbery ."
10292,"So , we can not urge the son to throttle the essentially healthy and scientific "" father "" system by fair mean or foul without considering the consequences , because there are problems in its practice and development -- such as state monopoly for purchases and sales , lower efficiency due to centralized management , and inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal ."
10293,"It is because that will not only make the society increasingly ignorant and sick as it violates the rule of benign social development , distorts normal "" human relations "" and the ethic and prevalent value and the rule of civilization update rooted in it , but the humanity will retrogress as people 's thoughts and behaviors become increasingly ridiculous ."
10294,"Yes , this is the case ."
10295,"My opinion above is not absurd and delusive at all , because this is true not only in theory , but also to the rule of social development as demonstrated by historical facts , as well as from the perspective of the situation and reality of the country : None of the current "" advocates of market economy , private ownership and dictatorship of the bourgeoisie "" has established and proposed a new deal "" against planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat . """
10296,"All their criticisms are directed at the developmental symptoms such as "" lower efficiency due to centralized management "" or "" inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal , "" all their proclamations are political attacks and instigation aimed to win over the less than 5 % "" vested interests , "" and their development logic asks the "" 95 % "" laboring people to stay where they are and willingly endure the hard work -- it speaks for itself how empty , ridiculous , sick , ignorant and anti-government it is ."
10297,"That 's why I want to say to the world and the age by the end of the article : when the father 's toes are injured , we should try our best to treat the foot problem , and open up a new life and embrace health in the principle of respecting human relations , obeying people 's wishes , conforming to science and carrying on the legacy -- if the present capitalist followers frantically urge the son to kill him by all means , the result could only be a tragedy !"
10298,"And these happen to be the core of the destiny where the capitalist roaders "" will inevitably bury themselves due to their ignorance and insanity , and more or less harm the human society ! """
10299,"At last , I would like to admonish sincerely and earnestly those who blindly oppose , hate and even suppress planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat , especially the "" mainstream elite scholars "" including Wu Jinglian , who insist on smearing the "" father "" to the end : do not treat the "" fathers "" on which the new civilization is based barbarously , against your conscience and frantically for immediate gains ."
10300,"The result is definitely a tragedy -- because even if you kill the "" father , "" your felony will be disdained by the age and condemned by the people , which naturally leads to nothing good !"

10311,"Title : Something Even More Absurd Than the "" Breakneck 90 M/H On a Snowy Night "" ?? My Personal Experience ."
10312,Originating site : BBS Unknown Space -LRB- Tue Jan 16 22:51:46 2007 -RRB- .
10313,I have deep feelings and a lot of sympathy with the author after reading the article Breakneck 90 m/h on a Snowy Night .
10314,"It also reminds me of something that I experienced several years ago , also related to an airport and meeting people ."
10315,"A couple of years ago , my neighbor approached me to borrow my car , saying he was meeting his parents at the airport ."
10316,He also said both his wife and children wanted to go .
10317,"As his car was too small and mine was big , it could make his parents more comfortable ."
10318,He added that he would only use it for one morning and would return it to me before noon .
10319,"Although there was only a nodding acquaintance between the neighbor and me , we lived in the same apartment building after all and were both Chinese ."
10320,So I discussed with my wife back home and lent him the car as we thought we would not be using the car until the same afternoon .
10321,And then something happened ...
10322,"At 1:00pm , the neighbor called me , saying he took his parents to a buffet and would probably not to be back until around 3:00pm ."
10323,I of course agreed and asked them not to rush .
10324,"This wait lasted till 5:30pm , when the neighbor told me in a half - crying tone that there was an accident , and everyone else was intact , except his father , who was in hospital for fractures ."
10325,I comforted him first and asked my friend to rush me to the hospital .
10326,"My neighbor showed me the police report at the hospital , which indicated it was all my neighbor 's fault ."
10327,He clashed into a truck going straight when he made a left turn .
10328,My car was completely damaged and had been towed away .
10329,I forced myself to refrain from the grief of loosing my beloved car -LRB- mine was liability - only coverage -RRB- and asked the friend to send their family home .
10330,And then the nightmare began .
10331,"The next day , my neighbor called me , saying his father needed to undergo an operation in hospital and asked where the money would come from"
10332,I told him part would be covered by my car insurance .
10333,"After a while , he called again , saying the operation charge was high and it was difficult for them to afford"
10334,I tried my best to comfort him then and told him to think of a way slowly
10335,"Just then , a nearly crazy voice of a woman came from the other end of the line , saying her family had just saved several dozen thousand bucks for the down payment of a house ; where would they live afterwards if they spent this ."
10336,"She also said my car was a Japanese one , which had poor safety performance and it was my car to blame for the car accident ."
10337,She added that I should pay the money because the car was mine .
10338,I hung up the phone angrily as the dialog could not go on .
10339,"My wife -LSB- pw% -RSB- had been persuading me aside , saying some women would easily lose mind once in fury ."
10340,She asked me to take no heed of them and let them calm down first .
10341,So I did n't take their words seriously but still felt angry .
10342,"Out of my expectation , a phone call on the third day completely changed my original idea ."
10343,The telephone rang just as I was about to go to work in the morning .
10344,I thought it was a sales call and was prepared to end it perfunctorily .
10345,"Unexpectedly , coming from the other end of the line was a deep and resolute voice of a middle - aged man ."
10346,"He said in an incontestable tone that my neighbor had a car accident as a result of borrowing my car , which traumatized them both physically and mentally and harmed their economic interests , and as the car owner , they would not sue me if I compensated them for the hospital charge and the costs of missing work hours -LRB- three times -RRB- , otherwise they would see me in court ."
10347,He added that he was certain about the case as a lawyer in business for ten years and the compensation he requested could double in court .
10348,"As a great Chinese guy , how could I be scared by a few remarks of the lawyer ?"
10349,I also took up the weapon of law for justice .
10350,"Of course , I also retained a lawyer ."
10351,"Out of my expectation , my lawyer solved the problem by merely making two phone calls ."
10352,"One was to the police station , asking for any additional findings in the investigation report of the accident ."
10353,"There was additional findings unexpectedly , which were against them ."
10354,Someone at the junk yard found a bottle of unfinished wine without the lid inside the car and reported it to the police station .
10355,The police found they put the bottle of unfinished wine in the car without the lid after lunch .
10356,The second call was to their lawyer .
10357,So their lawyer dropped the lawsuit .
10358,"Of course , they would not stop it there and came to discuss with me several times , sometimes honey - tongued and sometimes threatening ."
10359,"The most classic one was : Do n't ever dream of living a life back to China , as we have people across the country ."
10360,Disgusting !
10361,"Here comes the old topic again , are you going to lend your car if your neighbor or friend asks ."
10362,I think many people will say they wo n't .
10363,I would suggest not to lend online .
10364,"However , the Internet is after all virtual ."
10365,Words sometimes have no emotions .
10366,"When your seemingly nice neighbor , seemingly close friend , or a girl whose eyes can speak asks for it in the real world , how many people will answer with a "" no ? """
10367,"Anyhow , I was not able to do that ."
10368,"I lent my car to some people in need after that , and I believe there are not many people like my former neighbor couple ."
10369,"In conclusion , here is a summery of the loss of the two sides : ."
10370,"Our side : A 02 Camary of 50,000 miles , retaining fee 200 . Annual leave two days ."
10371,"Their side : One leg of the father -LRB- repaired -RRB- , hospital charge : unknown , costs for missing work hours : unknown , retaining fee : unknown ."
10372,And most importantly : the dignity and honor of the entire family -LRB- except children -RRB- .

10380,"A month ago , I was really desperate , I lost my current job , which I was completely unprepared for , and had to find a job within a month to keep myself going ."
10381,"Now in this month with the Christmas holiday there 's really only three weeks of actual work time , and I do n't think any companies are going to be hiring people during this period ."
10382,"Despair , that sinking feeling weighing on my mind , so much pressure I could n't eat , could n't sleep ; I was simply going crazy ."
10383,But I still needed to do something ; getting crazy - hysteric makes no sense .
10384,"Then I started connecting with my friends in America ; I went to Maimaiti to ask for help , consulted about my status , and looked for a way to solve the problem ."
10385,Even my relatives ' friends in America and my parents ' friends all got involved .
10386,"Friends , it 's always friends who help me at key moments ."
10387,"Many friends got people they knew to recommend me , help me send out resumes , or call and commiserate with me ."
10388,"There was one friend who had just got an offer , but he did n't want to go , so he recommended me to go for him , but it was way off in LA , plus the salary was n't ideal , but at least it could help me keep the legal status , so I thought I would take it ."
10389,"After the telephone interview , I flew to LA , landing at 12:00 noon , and at 4:00 p.m. ."
10390,I had the interview .
10391,By then 17 - 18 hours had passed since I 'd gotten up at 4:00 a.m.
10392,"Although I was too tired to walk , I still had to pump up my spirits so I 'd be in peak form for the interview ."
10393,"The interview did n't last long , just two hours and it was over ."
10394,"I felt the interview went well , and started to feel confident ."
10395,"But on that day one senior level person was n't there , so the next day early I had to go back to talk to him ."
10396,"So the next day I got up at 7:00 and ran over to chat for an hour ; that guy was nice , did n't embarrass me , so after an hour it ended happily ."
10397,"After that the boss took me to the home office , and on the way he gave me an oral offer , and he said it would not be easy for me to come right away , that I should do the physical exam immediately and do all the paperwork , wait until after New Year 's , and the HR director would return and turn in the H1 ."
10398,"Then I went straight for the physical , and I filled out the application form , reference list , etc."
10399,"At 3:00 p.m. , the dust finally settled ."
10400,Finally before Christmas I received a Christmas present .
10401,"Although I still have n't made the final decision to go , at least I have a guaranteed - minimum choice ."
10402,So I am thanking everyone for helping me .
10403,I hope that all my friends who are still looking for work will be able to find their ideal job in the New Year .

10406,Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Beijing 's Gas Price vs. US Gas Price
10407,Guo Kai 's Economic Notes
10408,In the US the current average price of regular unleaded gas is about 2.3 US dollars per gallon -LRB- 3.78 liters -RRB- .
10409,"According to the official exchange rate of one US dollar for 7.9 RMB , this price is equivalent to 4.80 yuan / liter ."
10410,"Note , this gas price includes all taxes ."
10411,"The current gas price in Beijing is 5.09 yuan / liter , 2 mao and 9 fen more than in the US ."
10412,"In fact , the gas price difference between the two places is larger than 2 mao and 9 fen because China 's gas price does not include so many taxes as in the US ; for example , the highway maintenance fee in China is paid separately ."
10413,"Just now , I only narrated a fact ."
10414,But I believe that different persons see different problems in this fact .
10415,"Let me describe people 's two reactions that I can imagine , or the two problems I can see ."
10416,1. The US gas price is too cheap .
10417,"In an absolute sense , the US gas price has +already been cheaper than China 's , and in a relative sense , the US gas price is even cheaper ."
10418,"In the US , the money you pay for a meal at McDonald 's can fill up more than 10 liters of gas , but in Beijing you can get 5 - 6 liters of gas at most ."
10419,The US low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country 's excessive use of and overdependence on energy resources .
10420,"However , there is more to this matter , the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by the US excessive energy consumption : global warming , and wars caused by oil , etc."
10421,It is totally a joke that the US gas price could be cheaper than China 's .
10422,2. China 's gas price is too expensive .
10423,"Both Americans and Chinese buy gas from the international market , and the technology and cost of oil refinement are not too much different ."
10424,"But with the US gas price including taxes even lower than China 's gas price excluding taxes , you can see how much money Chinese oil companies have made out of this ."
10425,"If there are no price controls and monopolies , China 's gas price should n't have been this high ."
10426,I want to say that I think these two opinions are both correct .
10427,"So , on the issue of oil consumption , I think China and the US , the No. 1 and No. 2 oil consumers in the world , are also a funny pair ."
10428,"From a global perspective , the US gas price is obviously too low ."
10429,"So Mankiw at Harvard even formed a "" Pigou Club , "" gathering social celebrities who support levying higher taxes on gas prices -LRB- hereby raising gas prices -RRB- ."
10430,China 's gas prices are more complicated .
10431,"In fact , gas prices in China are probably not very high , but in order to reduce China 's future overdependence on gas , it may be better that China 's gas prices are higher ."
10432,"But , the direct result of the gas price increase in China will be the increase of monopoly profits of the monopoly companies ."
10433,"This part of money will not become the government tax revenue , will not be used for public welfare , and on the contrary , will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better ."
10434,"In other words , the gas price in China is too high in the distributive sense ."
10435,It is the price that transfers the entire social resources to a very small number of people .
10436,"But in terms of sustainability , China 's gas price may still be too low ."
10437,We need high gas prices to control the overdependence on energy imports .
10438,"Perhaps someone will condemn me , saying further increase of gas prices will make life unbearable for people ."
10439,"If you are a taxi driver , my reply is : the reason your life is unbearable is not the gas price , but because of our taxi licensing regulation system ."
10440,"If you are a car owner , my reply is : ride the subway and bus more often ."
10441,"It saves money , reduces congestion , and also lets you know car owners are not in a position to say "" life is unbearable . """
10442,"Compared with most people , your life is already quite good ."
10443,darling0823
10444,Comparing McDonald 's in the US with McDonald 's in China may not be right .
10445,Eating a meal at McDonald 's in the US is more comparable to buying a 5 - yuan boxed meal in China .

10448,[] <POSTER> Bcc
10449,[Bcc] -LSB- the following article was forwarded from Overseas Discussion Area -RSB- .
10450,[Bcc] I do n't know what the best way to deal with your child is .
10451,Do you know ?
10452,"[Bcc] You 're 20 years old ; when you decided to have him , did you think you 'd be going through this problem ?"
10453,"[Bcc] If you 're thinking only of this child , then you should use legal means as quickly as possible to resolve this problem ."
10454,[Bcc] But what the law can resolve is only the issue of alimony .
10455,[Bcc] How do you plan on getting through the future ?
10456,[Bcc] Will this child grow up in China or in the United States ?
10457,"[Bcc] If in the United States , how will you support yourself ?"
10458,[Bcc] How can you assure his livelihood ?
10459,[Bcc] By relying on Professor Cui 's alimony ?
10460,[Bcc] By relying on government assistance ?
10461,"[Bcc] Even with both parents working , supporting a child is difficult ."
10462,"[Bcc] How can you assure this child 's education , food and clothing ?"
10463,[Bcc] The child is blameless .
10464,"[Bcc] Regardless of the reason that he came into this world , you can say that you struggled with all these difficulties for his benefit ."
10465,[Bcc] But what did all this struggling get you ?
10466,[Bcc] And what do you plan to struggle for ?
10467,[Bcc] You and CY ca n't be together .
10468,"[Bcc] Even if his wife divorces him , her two children will need alimony too ."
10469,"[Bcc] Of all that you struggle for , the only thing left may be a limited amount of money and this child 's nationality ."
10470,[Bcc] These things are far from enough to give him the happiness he needs .
10471,"[Bcc] What he needs is a stable , warm home , a loving and not hostile environment , a mother at peace with herself ."
10472,"[Bcc] Whether you love CY or you hate him , it 's a mistake ."
10473,"[Bcc] You should not let this mistake influence your judgment , a judgment about the future and welfare of your child ."
10474,"[Bcc] If you really loved him , then God has already granted you the fruit of this love ;"
10475,"[Bcc] if you still bear animosity , then you should learn to forget that animosity in the warm expression in your child 's eyes , and not contaminate his purity with your animosity ."
10476,[Bcc] Ugliness is its own punishment .
10477,"[Bcc] In court , you carry that child , looking for the man who loves him and loves you ."
10478,[Bcc] I hope mother and child are in good health and happy .
10479,"[Bcc] -LSB- in xiaojueniu -LRB- peace is happiness -RRB- 's article , this was mentioned : -RSB- :"

10482,I only answered you to give them time to consider and prepare ; I am only acting in my child 's interests .
10483,"[Bcc] : If Cui Yi does not accept responsibility and does n't even make any good - faith acknowledgement of his mistake , then the legal process will go forward ."
10484,"A person should [Bcc] : behave with dignity , with moral integrity ; nobody forgives people who want to cover up their mistakes ."
10485,"Toward your own flesh and blood , [Bcc] : someone who is so cruel , I ca n't let him go unpunished ."
10486,"Miss , if you can see these words of mine , I hope you can [Bcc] : contact me ."
10487,"I will answer you and do some things for you and your child , therefore I am waiting for you to show good faith ."
10488,"So many days have passed , I [Bcc] : have n't waited for anything at all ."
10489,I am keeping my promise to you .
10490,This week is the last week I 'll wait .
10491,My attorney has already [Bcc] : informed me that I can not communicate with you again .
10492,But I want to trust you .
10493,Please do n't disappoint me .
10494,I trust that you are a [Bcc] : good person and wo n't deceive me .
10495,"If you are sincere , please have your attorney contact my attorney as soon as possible , OK ?"
10496,"For the sake of my [Bcc] : child , I need to stand up and move ahead ."

10504,[] Outer Mongolia Voluntarily Proposes to Return to China : a Conspiracy to Alienate China and Russia ?
10505,[] <POSTER> jeffery7373
10506,"[jeffery7373] Recently , a message "" Mongolian Parliament Proposes to Merge Mongolia into China "" is extraordinarily striking ."
10507,[jeffery7373] It was reported that State Great Hural of Mongolia was currently discussing a proposal about a plan for Mongolia and China to found a federal state .
10508,[jeffery7373] The Govi member first put forward the above plan in the State Social and Economic Development Seminar .
10509,"[jeffery7373] On October 30 , 2004 , State Great Hural of Mongolia held a special discussion on the establishment of Sino - Mongolian coalition and merger of Mongolia into China ."
10510,"[jeffery7373] During the discussion , the Govi member proposed to merge Mongolia into China and build a special administrative district like Hong Kong and Macau in China , making Mongolia return to the motherland finally and becoming a part of China ."
10511,"[jeffery7373] As early as 1995 , 2000 and 2002 , there were parliamentary members who kept proposing to join Mongolia with China , but these bills never get discussed due to the resistances ."
10512,"[jeffery7373] In recent years , Mongolian government faces growing pressure arising from economic hardship ."
10513,The wealthy life of the Mongolian nationality in places like Erlian in China resulted in strong attractions to herdsmen .
10514,"[jeffery7373] People including many upper class figures are increasingly attracted by China 's economic growth , particularly the relative prosperity and affluence in Inner Mongolia ."
10515,"[jeffery7373] However , on the other hand China 's ambition to "" recapture "" Outer Mongolia in its political territory will also be very far away and even nearly impossible ."
10516,"[jeffery7373] First , there are still enormous resistances inside Mongolia against "" returning "" to China ."
10517,"Moreover , even the form of merger conceived by those "" returnists "" also has some divergences from China 's will ."
10518,"[jeffery7373] Second , international resistances , including those from USA , Japan and particularly Russia , are sure to be very vehement ."
10519,"After all , we still need Russia 's help in our international strategy and defense development ."
10520,"[jeffery7373] Third , the response of the Mongolian nationality to this issue can not be ignored either ."
10521,[jeffery7373] One thing to point out is that the loyalty of China 's Mongolian nationality to their country is unquestionable .
10522,"[jeffery7373] If "" Tibetan independence "" and "" Xinjiang independence "" may have more or less social foundation among Tibetan and Xinjing people , the so - called "" Mongolian independence "" is absolutely the mental masturbation of a tiny proportion of Mongolian intellectuals and overseas anti-China powers ."
10523,"[jeffery7373] Despite all this , many Mongolian in Inner Mongolia are not willing to see the complete disappearance of an independent Mongolia ."
10524,I believe such sentiment should be understandable .
10525,"[jeffery7373] Hastily "" recapturing "" Outer Mongolia may cause resistance among Inner Mongolian people ."
10526,[jeffery7373] Background Information .
10527,[jeffery7373] The Great Hural of Mongolia proposed to return to China 43 times .
10528,"[jeffery7373] In 1921 , the Mongolian people won the revolution and declared independence in July and established a "" constitutional monarchy . """
10529,"[jeffery7373] Following the death of Jebtsundamba in May 1924 , the 1st People 's Great Hural was held in Kulun on November of the same year and declared the abolishment of Constitutional Monarchy and founded the People 's Republic of Mongolia ."
10530,"[jeffery7373] On February 11 , 1945 , the leaders of USA , USSR and UK signed Yalta Agreement that covered the sovereignty of Outer Mongolia ."
10531,"[jeffery7373] In 1946 , the National Government of China recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia ."
10532,"[jeffery7373] Upon the foundation of the People 's Republic of China , it established its diplomatic relations with China on October 16 , 1949 ."
10533,[jeffery7373] Mongolia is an inland country and borders China and Russia only .
10534,"[jeffery7373] This determines three types of nation survival strategies , pro-Russia or pro-China or balance among powers ."
10535,"[jeffery7373] At present , Mongolia 's nation survival strategy is balance among powers and seeks the maximum interests for itself ."
10536,"[jeffery7373] Prior to the breakdown of the Soviet Union , Mongolia did n't have its own troops and defense was provided by the Soviet Union ."
10537,"[jeffery7373] After the disintegration of the Soviet Union , Mongolia started to build its compulsory service scheme and recruit frontier troops ."
10538,"[jeffery7373] However , Mongolia borders China and Russia only , and even all people are soldiers can not guarantee the 100 percent security of its soil ."
10539,"[jeffery7373] Thus , it has nearly no military forces ."
10540,"[jeffery7373] In fact , the Soviet Union itself ever considered the incorporation of Mongolia as a union republic seriously and provided permanent defense , but gave it up because of the strong objection from Mongolia ."
10541,[jeffery7373] The control of Russia over the Far East area was significantly reduced as a result of its domestic weakness .
10542,"[jeffery7373] The breakdown of the Soviet Union had huge and far - reaching effects on China , [jeffery7373] and made great contributions to the whole world , [jeffery7373] and benefits Chinese nationalities a lot ."
10543,"[jeffery7373] The military expenditure for the land forces could be transferred to the air and naval forces , and there emerged a growingly powerful air force and blue ocean fleet and a relatively safe and peaceful construction period of several decades , and China can come close to the feasible action that will solve the Taiwan issue indeed , [jeffery7373] and the military science made substantial progress , and the ideologically blank area left as a result of the disintegration of the Soviet Union -LRB- these traditional scope of the Soviet Union 's influence like Iran and Egypt in Middle East , and Cuba , Venezuela and Bolivia in Latin America -RRB- was gained quickly ,"
10544,[jeffery7373] This was impossible to achieve before the disintegration of the Soviet Union .
10545,"[jeffery7373] Meanwhile , it brought a very rare opportunity for Mongolia 's return ."
10546,"[jeffery7373] Although the Great Hural of Mongolia proposed to return to China 43 times , China has n't made any positive comments and feedback so far ."
10547,[jeffery7373] Voice .
10548,[jeffery7373] It is not the right time for Mongolia 's return .
10549,"[jeffery7373] Firstly , Mongolia 's geographic location is very important and situated between China and Russia ."
10550,"If Mongolia returned to China , it would cast shadow on Sino - Russian relations inevitably and damage the whole situation of the Sino - Russian strategic cooperation ."
10551,"[jeffery7373] In the period of Three Kingdoms , Sun Quan and Liu Bei broke their coalition for Jing prefecture ."
10552,[jeffery7373] Mongolia has an important strategic location as Jing prefecture .
10553,"[jeffery7373] Both China and Russia develop friendly relations with Mongolia , which has positive impact on the stabilization of Sino - Russian borders and Mongolia 's domestic situation ."
10554,"[jeffery7373] Otherwise , If Mongolia returned , it would make Russia feel facing a great enemy and obstruct the rise of Russia ."
10555,"[jeffery7373] A weak Russia allows USA to concentrate on threatening China , which will undermine the benefits of our great strategy ."
10556,"[jeffery7373] Secondly , we are not strong enough ."
10557,"[jeffery7373] Among many problems related to the reunification of the motherland , Mongolia has low priority , far less important than Taiwan , Diaoyu Island and South Sea ."
10558,[jeffery7373] We can not accept Mongolia because of its voluntary return .
10559,"[jeffery7373] Before these problems get solved , the timing of Mongolia 's return can not be mature ."
10560,[jeffery7373] It is quite simple .
10561,"If the nation is not strong , we can not get reunified for reunification and lose the great opportunity to develop our strength ."
10562,"[jeffery7373] Thirdly , Mongolia 's motivation for return is not strong , and its will is not firm and can be suspected to be a kind of speculation ."
10563,"[jeffery7373] Nowadays , Mongolia is developing friendly relations with both USA and Japan and conducted joint military exercises with USA , which has troops stationed in Mongolia ."
10564,"All these indicate that Mongolia 's return may be a giant alienating conspiracy , the purpose of which is to make China and Russia suspect each other and fight against each other for Mongolia and lose cooperation and trust ."
10565,"[jeffery7373] Fourthly , for China and Russia , they should develop their relations with Mongolia jointly and expel the forces of USA and Japan out of Mongolia ."
10566,"This is what we should do , [jeffery7373] rather than accept Mongolia 's hesitant return blindly ."
10567,"[jeffery7373] Offering to ally with Russia , reaching its understanding and developing relations with Mongolia , are our best strategy ."
10568,"[jeffery7373] Therefore , we are patriots but not blind ones ."
10569,"Only if we have strategic thinking , consider the long - term stability and security of the country , and consider the international situations , we can make the best decision ."
10570,[herobeauty] Which year 's news ?
10571,"[saite] Without doubt , the strategic location of Mongolia is more important than Taiwan ."
10572,"[saite] If Mongolia can be recaptured , it deserves high priority ."
10573,"[saite] In fact , the real implacable enemies of China are not the United States but Russia and Japan ."
10574,[saite] I prefer to give up Taiwan rather than Mongolia .
10575,[saite] Recapturing Mongolia can give Russia a fatal strike and meanwhile further secure our geographically strategic environment .
10576,[saite] Churchill ever said there was no friendship but interests between nations .
10577,[saite] We do n't need to care about the feeling of Russian .
10578,"[saite] Actually , we and Russian have been deeply suspicious and jealous of each other all the time , but both remain tacit ."
10579,[saite] China has to rely on itself to become mighty .

10654,You can understand it simply by looking at the map .
10655,[qianwang] Resouces !
10656,[zoun] Taiwan used to be a part of China and this is recognized by the international community .
10657,"[zoun] However , USA and Japan have set up obstacles ."
10658,It can be solved sooner or later .
10659,"[zoun] This Mongolia was lost in the hands of Old Jiang , so it is a problem ."
10660,"[zoun] The map of the Republic of China is always in a shape of mulberry leaf , is n't it ?"
10661,"[zoun] Once Taiwan is taken back , the name of the country can be changed to the Republic of China with the flag of blue sky and white sun and the mulberry leaf - shaped map reused ."
10662,"In this way , we have more reasons and confidences to recapture Mongolia ."
10663,Hehe .
10664,"[zoun] Actually , Russian and Japanese are our greatest threats ."
10665,"[zoun] -LRB- In the master piece of saite -LRB- saite -RRB- , it is mentioned : -RRB-"
10666,"[zoun] : Without doubt , the strategic location of Mongolia is more important than Taiwan ."
10667,"[zoun] : If Mongolia can be recaptured , it deserves high priority ."
10668,"[zoun] : In fact , the real implacable enemies of China are not the United States but Russia and Japan ."
10669,[zoun] : I prefer to give up Taiwan rather than Mongolia .

10673,"[zoun] : Actually , we and Russian have been deeply suspicious and jealous of each other all the time , but both remain tacit ."
10674,[zoun] : China has to rely on itself to become mighty .
10675,"The fact that the Olympic torch is able to arrive China safely , the significant role of the overseas Chinese is undeniable ."
10676,There was a time when some people had always harbored a hostile mentality towards overseas Chinese .
10677,"Even if they returned to serve the country and even if news articles called them "" returnees , "" what was actually in people 's mind were names like "" sea turtles "" or "" sea weeds . """
10678,"Anyway , none of the names treated those students who had returned or wanted to return with due respect ."
10679,A friend of mine once made a call to ask about how things were going at the research institute where he ever worked .
10680,"The director immediately responded , "" Do n't come back if you are doing well in the United States ! """
10681,I reckon he was afraid he might lose his job to a returnee .
10682,"The Great Olympic Torch Relay has not only demonstrated the capabilities of overseas Chinese , but more importantly has showcased their patriotism as clear as the sun in the sky , which dwarfs those bad nationals who are unaccomplished , ill - intentioned or even corrupt and allows the Chinese government to see overseas Chinese in a better light ."
10683,"This will certainly be inspirational and helpful to the Chinese government , among other things , in its future policy - making concerning cadres , talents and returnees , as well as adjusting its rigid citizenship rules ."
10684,China is probably approaching the turning point at which overall inflation starts to decline .
10685,The shortage of pork has always been one of the main reasons for the overall inflation to skyrocket .
10686,"However , in recent weeks , domestic food prices have been stable or declining , relieving the public concern over shortage of supplies ."
10687,"For example , the weekly survey by the Ministry of Commerce of China shows that as of February , the wholesale price of fresh pork had been steadily rising to nearly 23 yuan per kilogram -LRB- equivalent to 3.29 U.S. dollars -RRB- ."
10688,"Since then , the price has basically stabilized , falling back at 22.21 yuan last week ."
10689,"Even if the prices of products like pork do not drop , the inflation rate may also decline ."
10690,"Since China 's CPI altogether broke through 5 % in July of last year , the base of comparison for last year 's prices will be significantly raised , starting from July this year ."
10691,"If no accelerated increase in prices has occurred by that time , then as time goes on , the year - on - year increase rate of prices will decline ."
10692,"The soaring food prices have indeed caused a lot of burden on impoverished people , but so far the overall consumption expenditure in China does not seem to have been affected by inflation ."
10693,"Marx affirmed Feuerbach 's materialism in the field of nature , but criticized his idealism in the field of social history ."
10694,"Basically , facing the ugly reality of capitalism , he sank into idealism in terms of how to solve social problems , believing "" universal love "" was capable of treating social wounds ."
10695,"This is similar to the refrain , "" if everyone gives a little love , the world will become a beautiful society , "" sung in popular songs today ."
10696,"On the basis of his critique of Feuerbach , Marx established the scientific socialism of historical materialism and found "" the path of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat "" to transform capitalist society ."
10697,But various representatives of the bourgeois humanitarian thought always wanted to replace revolution with humanitarianism and even distorted the core value of Marxist communism into humanitarianism .
10698,Marx gave a merciless refutation of this .
10699,"He said , if the humanitarianism of early capitalism still had somewhat progressive significance to feudalism , then after we have already blazed a path and found the approach of scientific socialism , to still preach the bourgeoisie 's humanitarianism would mean that he was either new to the revolution , or he was the fiercest enemy of the revolution ."
10700,The Tangshan Earthquake left behind over 4000 orphans .
10701,"In the Wenchuan Earthquake , the first things to collapse in practically every town were the school buildings , while the government buildings next door were far sturdier ."
10702,"The bodies of the students killed in the earthquake came to rest in the school playgrounds , the unremitting wretched cries of many family members confirming the deceased or paying respects harrowing the hearts of the hearers ."
10703,"During the course of the relief effort , various media either consciously or unconsciously began ranking contributions to the relief effort ."
10704,"On one hand , this had the effect of earning community respect for some altruistic big players while carrying out their obligations to society , while on the other hand left others in very awkward territory , with on - the - spot grillings about community responsibility leading to some public figures lamenting that "" charity must not become a burden "" , and what sort of community culture does all this reflect ?"
10705,"Whether or not there really are any warning signs for such a large quake , this "" global dilemma "" , only God knows ."
10706,"Public crises from floods , SARS , snowstorms to earthquakes at another level are testing the response and resilience of our societal mechanisms , which encompasses the ability to handle a crisis from top to bottom at a decision - making level and the ability to promptly and effectively deploy society resources , also taking in the initiative and teamwork skills of the community at large , from the lowest rung to the highest ."
10707,"Actually , in the years since the reforms , out of the numerous party members and ordinary cadres who worked to combat previous disasters , the majority through selfless dedication and practical action demonstrated that they were worthy members of the working class vanguard ! Demonstrating that it was they who were the real nucleus , the backbone force and the hope of the Chinese Communist Party ."
10708,"Even those who went down the road of capitalist reform in the name of the party , they often ran the gauntlet of insults , sharing the "" agony "" of unemployment with countless other workers and the masses ."
10709,"It 's difficult to imagine that without the vast majority of party members and ordinary cadres who shared the good and bad times with the people , shared their trials and tribulations , together bearing the weight of the "" three big mountains "" brought about by the capitalist reforms , whether these disastrous reforms could have lasted all the way to the present ! That the leadership authority of the party and nation , stolen by the capitalist roaders , the capitalist reformers and the revisionist groups could last until today !"
10710,"The entire party , entire army , and the whole country , especially the people in the disaster zone have not yet fully lost confidence in the Chinese Communist Party , even fervently hoping the party can crack down on corruption , and reestablish its former glorious and correct greatness !"
10711,"And therefore , the vast majority of party members and ordinary cadres who genuinely and sincerely care about the people in the disaster zone , will , just as in the past , support the rebuilding of the disaster area , even to the extent of sacrificing everything at the moment of truth , including their lives ."
10712,"They completely stopped doing chimney construction , and the next chimney projects that were taken were directly contracted out , while still publicly claiming that it was their own team , thus messing around for a few more years ."
10713,"Later on , chimney construction was completely dropped ."
10714,"And then , the company delved into the labor market and promoted project management with regard to construction ."
10715,"The project department was only in charge of using people , and they did n't keep loafers even for a day ."
10716,Loafers were directly handed over to the Labor Center .
10717,"They gave 200 yuan a month for living expenses , which basically means they were laid off ."
10718,"Because the company has n't recruited young employees for more than ten years , most of these people were what was called "" personnel in their 40s and 50s "" in society , a small handful of them were engineers and technicians , including some young university graduates ."
10719,"They should be reasonably considered unemployed people , but I do n't know if the government 's statistics of unemployed people include these people or not ."
10720,"Nowadays , all employees are completely replaced by contracted teams ."
10721,"Because there is no reference of the income of the previous construction workers , the migrant workers ' wages are constantly increasing ."
10722,The profits brought to companies from decreasing labor costs are also decreasing due to the government 's measures for protecting migrant workers in recent years .
10723,"Because migrant worker turnover is very fast and they frequently change companies or construction sites , they often work among several construction sites , which brings difficulties to company quality and safety management ."
10724,This causes project quality to be unstable and increases potential safety hazards .
10725,Good products sell well at high prices throughout the world .
10726,Most people accept this concept .
10727,It would n't be bad if the price of goods in China could be equal to that of the countries in the first world .
10728,"If all the high - quality products did n't sell well at high prices in China and were sold cheaply everywhere , sellers would probably suffer great losses ."
10729,People who do n't want to sell their good things at high price are fools .
10730,Who does n't want to save their own resources to buy good things at low prices ?
10731,Is it worth it to use low prices to dominate the market ?
10732,"People used to do business by selling their surplus products , but what surplus products do we ourselves have ?"
10733,Whether or not this main direction is right or wrong can not be explained .
10734,Our main direction is exchanging a large quantity of cheap products for a large amount of foreign currency .
10735,"From an economic perspective , many foreigners are also making a lot of money from Chinese people ."
10736,Whether it is a surplus or deficit is not something that ordinary people are clear about .
10737,"From the perspective of mutual exchange of needed products , there needs to be normal international trades after all ."
10738,"As a matter of fact , this boundary has already been crossed a long time go ."
10739,"Products that are in short supply in this country are exported in large quantity , and products this country has are still imported in large quantity ."
10740,This has already gone against the principles of Chinese lifestyle .
10741,"I am in Taipei , and other than donating a small amount of money to Tzu Chi to support my fellow countrymen , I really could n't do a whole lot ."
10742,I could only say : Go fellow countrymen in Sichuan !! Go Chinese people on both sides of the Strait !!
10743,"Let me share something I 've learned with my friends and countrymen in the mainland , especially those in Sichuan ."
10744,"Those who have survived the great earthquake that had resulted in enormous casualties , other than being careful with the deadly epidemic and viruses , most importantly , must pay attention to the survivors who are suffering depression triggered by the unbearable deaths of their family members and close friends near them , so as to prevent a wave of suicide ."
10745,"I 'm stressing once again , every effort must be made to cheer up and encourage the people who survived the disaster so as to prevent a wave of suicide ."
10746,This is very terrible and should n't be taken lightly .
10747,Waves of suicide occurred after the great Hanshin earthquake in Japan or after the 9 / 21 earthquake in Taiwan .
10748,"Especially with regard to =Hanshin , many of the survivors committed suicide one after another during the period of six months to one year after the earthquake ."
10749,"So in the case of the 9 / 21 earthquake back then , Tzu Chi , based on the experience from the Hanshin earthquake disaster , laid special emphasis on encouraging the survivors in the disaster area of Nantou in Taiwan and let them cry out loud whenever they felt sad ."
10750,"By allowing them to pour out their excruciating sorrow over the dead , they tried to keep them from contemplating suicide ."
10751,"In the wake of the earthquake in Wenchuan , Sichuan , companies have followed up the actual situation with substantial donations , while conducting rational integrated event marketing ."
10752,"Tencent has demonstrated =great strength in this event , as not only has the company donated RMB 10 million , but Tencent users have donated over 10 million in disaster - relief funds ."
10753,"In the wee hours of May 13 , Ma Huateng even personally supervised R & D of QQ prayer version that Tencent made for people in the disaster - hit areas ."
10754,"Well then , how did Tencent properly covered these incidents ?"
10755,"First , Tencent integrated the willingness of consumers , which is the willingness of Tencent users to donate for disaster - hit areas , and launched donation platforms on Tenpay , QQ prayer version and Tencent public charity website ."
10756,"It proves that Tencent 's grasp of its users has been very accurate , Tencent 's wisdom !"
10757,The wisdom and social responsibility of users reflected the social responsibility of Tencent as a dot - com company .
10758,The amount for disaster relief donated by Tencent users has topped 10 million .
10759,"Integrated marketing is about integrating the willingness of consumers , which Tencent did in a very quick and comprehensive way ."
10760,"With more and more people willing to try the linux system , these habits may enable you to get twice the result with half the effort and find the fun in it ."
10761,"When you first begin to use Linux , you may feel unaccustomed to it ."
10762,Many masters also share the same experience .
10763,They were once newbies after all .
10764,"However , the Linux community is already doing an outstanding job in providing new users with relevant guides , manuals and basic technical documents , so that they can get started as soon as possible ."
10765,"When I first got my hands on Linux three years ago , many people have helped me through forums , online chat and email ."
10766,"These "" penguins "" were really warm - hearted indeed ."
10767,"For this , I feel much obliged to do something within my capacity for the community that have helped me selflessly and write something for friends who have just begun to use Linux ."
10768,Here I 've compiled and translated seven habits others told me when I was a beginner .
10769,"I believe if you apply the seven habits , you will feel it more secure and convenient and learn a lot of useful things when using Linux ."
10770,Ultimately you will find using Linux is also as enjoyable .
10771,"In my opposition to despotism and pursuit of democracy , old Donghai has always been frank and integral ."
10772,I am who I really am and stick to the path of kind - heartedness .
10773,I oppose what should be opposed and pursue what should be pursued .
10774,"Donghai 's heart , as upright as a heavenly guardian , will not be "" touched "" based on if the CPC will touch me -"
10775,"Of course , both the CPC and I will be lucky if the CPC does not touch me ."
10776,"As for why , I do n't know or care to ask ."
10777,"A friend inside the system ever told me : I disagree with your political opinion , but we know you are different from some people , in that you are not for yourself , but rather genuinely for the good of the country -LRB- rough meaning -RRB- ."
10778,I 'm pretty moved and gratified over such words .
10779,It is commendable that such an understanding is from the camp I 'm opposed to .
10780,"It is far more normal and honest than some "" fellows "" in the democracy and "" Confucian "" factions ."
10781,"Nonetheless , it is not that profound , because "" for the good of the country "" is just for my own good ."
10782,"Ancient scholars were for themselves , and Confucianism is a learning for one 's own good ."
10783,"The work of developing inner morality and applying moral virtue to everything else must be furthered and completed by using various political , social , scientific practices ."
10784,"For Chinese Confucianists , in the current historic stage , it 's the best practice of benevolent ruling to oppose privileges and pursue human rights and to oppose despotism and pursue democracy ."
10785,"Recently I 've been preparing to change career course , leaving the stock market to grow in the real estate industry ."
10786,"This in no way is because I see the stock market as empty and the real estate industry as promising , but because I think that at this moment in time , China 's real estate industry more than the stock market needs some creative financial tools to neutralize the huge risks that have accumulated over the past few years ."
10787,"What I had n't expected was that the vast majority of people after hearing about my decision first asked me : "" When are house prices going to fall ? """
10788,"They did n't want to hear my reasoning , instead expecting me to sum up predictions in real estate price trends in one simple sentence ."
10789,""" Just like you predicted the stock market , how you often said ' No bull market with inflation ' , that kind of straightforwardness "" ."
10790,"I understand these friends do n't really care about the intriguing framework and theory of the stock market , or the government 's complex regulations and policies ."
10791,So I intend to first answer their most pressing concern .
10792,"In regard to China 's domestic real estate prices , I sum it up in one sentence : "" When oil prices are deregulated , house prices will plummet . """
10793,"In the last three years , I have always thought that only when the RMB gains value against a basket of currencies will house prices start to fall ."
10794,"Any policies apart from this only serve to allow the government to boost tax revenue , or allow the state - owned Commercial Bank to increase interest returns ."
10795,Some have said that the idea of regarding Google as just a search engine company is well past its best buy date .
10796,Google 's aim is to supplant individual PC's or company data centers and become a global computer .
10797,"And becoming a global computer hinges on cloud computing , this "" simple but powerful "" concept ."
10798,"Schmidt is not mincing matters , as a proponent of cloud computing , "" Every investment that Google makes and all the work it does is all about cloud computing "" ."
10799,"Google , this Internet giant with big dreams , also offers a lot of novel and exciting services ."
10800,"From browsing the planet from your living room with Google Earth to a new service developed by Google this March -- Google Sky Map -LRB- Google Sky -RRB- , via Web page browsers , users can bring to reality their dreams of "" walking in space "" , observe remote galaxies , planetary motion , even watching the explosion of supernovae ."

10809,"Michael Jackson may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveals more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine ."
10810,Almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
10811,"Yesterday , Jackson was ordered to close Neverland for having failed to pay the ranch 's 47 employees their salary or insurance since the end of 2005 ."
10812,Unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandoned llamas but no surprise .
10813,"He 's moved on since his aquittal , like Gary Glitter did after his 1999 conviction , having departed last June for a Bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge ."
10814,"-LRB- '' For the people working at Bahrain 's malls , the person covered head to toe in a black veil , gloves and glasses appeared to be a rich , doting Saudi mother ...."
10815,But why would a woman wear a man 's shoes ?
10816,Why the bodyguards ?
10817,And why did the person 's fluid movements seem so familiar ? '' -RRB-
10818,"Last week 's real Jackson story ran in the New York Daily News , under the snappy banner `` Creepy dad was root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''"
10819,"The singer was brother Jermaine , and the claims based on the projected outline for his abandoned `` tell - all '' family story ."
10820,Reading that Joseph was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughters is not exactly a `` stop the presses '' moment .
10821,What 's new is this :
10822,Jermaine even suggested his father may have set up Michael to be somehow victimized by older men .
10823,"He tells how his father would have Michael join in at late - night hotel room meetings with `` important business people , '' and wondered whether `` something happened '' to Michael at those sessions ."
10824,He said he sensed something was wrong because Michael would be sick for days after .
10825,`` What was Joseph doing ? '' Jermaine wrote .
10826,"This lifts the Jackson family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege ."
10827,"This should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward ."
10828,All that 's missing is the element of occult terror .
10829,Or maybe not : `` LaToya also described being awakened in the night by Joseph wearing a ' monster mask . ' ''
10830,Perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the Jackson clan had gotten with the program .
10831,Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect .
10832,-LRB- This is how I tend to think of Ponchatoula 's Hosanna Church . -RRB-
10833,"Yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of Michael 's paranormal interests and peculiar associations ."
10834,"His close friendship with SPECTRA contactee and channeller of the Nine , Uri Geller , for one instance ."
10835,"-LRB- Jackson was Geller 's best man in 2001 when he and his wife renewed his vows , the same year Geller is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . -RRB-"
10836,His entourage including a `` personal magician '' for another .
10837,"Even if you wanted to , you wo n't be reading Jermaine 's account now ."
10838,"Like every Jackson sibling who 's tried to break from Joe , he 's climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of Michael 's threats to sue ."
10839,"Previously , Michael 's given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling his father ."
10840,"Yet there they were at Jackson 's trial last year , hand in hand ."
10841,In the big picture Michael Jackson means not very much .
10842,But his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggests .
10843,good stuff .
10844,having departed last June for a Bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
10845,"Actually , there have been reports for the past two days of Jackson back in California ."

10852,"It 's Saturday morning , and the papers say a moon of Saturn is spewing life - giving water .... then I see the new R.I. post is about the perrenial child Michael Jackson ."
10853,This day is named for Saturn ...

10855,and Saturn devoured all of his children when they were born to prevent this ... ''
10856,"Apparently Saturn is also intimately connected with Satan , Masonics , and Revelation 13 - you know , the `` number of the beast '' ..."
10857,Nevermind -
10858,I need a cup of coffee ...
10859,I looked in vain for the Cheney `` A hunting we will go '' to post this out and paste but ...
10860,"And on the subject of cowardice , consider this . In a recent hunting escapade , Dick Cheney accidentally shot one of his hunting comrades ."
10861,"There may have been negligence involved , but that is up to the local district attorney to decide ."
10862,"But more importantly , I think , is the nature of the hunt ."
10863,These were not wild birds .
10864,The birds were bred in captivity .
10865,"They had spent their lives in pens , and then on hunting day , were released for the sole purpose of being killed by Dick Cheney and cohorts for pure sport as they flew into the open sky for their only moments of brief freedom ."
10866,"Whether you are an animal lover or not , there is something disgusting and degrading about this kind of hunt and something less than human about those who participate in it ."
10867,The link `` personal majician '' is intrigueing .
10868,From Madsen via Boucher :
10869,"Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo , George W. Bush 's White House director of the Office of Faith - based Initiatives ."
10870,"Kuo , a former CIA employee ... had been Executive Director of the Center for Effective Compassion , founded in 1995 by Arianna Huffington ..."
10871,Kuo also previously worked for the Christian Coalition and Senator John Ashcroft .

10873,"The piper walks into the mountain , still followed by the children , and the cave closes again ..."
10874,Here is Boucher 's follow up to the `` majician '' link of Jeff 's .
10875,"on the mark as always , jeff ,"
10876,but i thought you might cover chile 's inauguration of its first woman president today instead ...
10877,maybe later as the story develops ?
10878,"Jeff Boucher 's piece mentions how victims of sexual abuse often have childlike voices , almost as if their development was ' frozen ' around the time of their abuse ."
10879,Jackson seems to be of this type .
10880,"Or more perversely , fakes that he is :"
10881,"`` I was always saying -LSB- to Jackson -RSB- people would n't think I was so crazy if they saw who the hell you really are , that you sit around , and you drink and you curse and you 're -LSB- expletive -RSB- funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time '' -"

10886,The witch doctor cursing Michael Jackson 's enemies and blessing the tarnished King of Pop himself in a voodoo ritual in Switzerland in the summer of 2000 had promised that the 25 people on Jackson 's enemies list -LRB- would soon be dead -RRB- ...
10887,"Jackson had ordered his then business adviser , Myung - Ho Lee , a U.S. - educated Korean lawyer based in Seoul , to wire $ 150,000 to a bank in Mali for a voodoo chief named Baba , who then had 42 cows ritually sacrificed for the ceremony ."
10888,Jackson had already undergone a blood bath ...
10889,"The pop star , who is said to be $ 240 million in debt , had paid six figures for a ritual cleansing using sheep blood to another voodoo doctor and a mysterious Egyptian woman named Samia , who came to him with a letter of greeting from a high - ranking Saudi prince , purportedly Nawaf Bin Abdulaziz Al - Saud , now the chief of intelligence of Saudi Arabia ..."

10891,"According to that Vanity Fair article , Jacko and Uri Geller met through `` that other fellow devotee of children 's charities Mohamed Fayed , the chairman of Harrods in London , who believes that the C.I.A. and Prince Philip had Princess Diana and his son , Dodi , killed . ''"
10892,"Anonymous quoted , `` Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo ... ''"
10893,Hold on --
10894,"the Cedars is the headquarters of the Fellowship Foundation , the creepy Christianoid cult with deep political connections ."
10895,Here 's a bit of the original Madsen article that the Michael Jackson quote comes from :
10896,"In 1976 , the Fellowship began looking for a permanent headquarters in Arlington ."
10897,"It set its sights on the estate of George Mason IV , The Cedars , located at 2301 North Uhle Street ."
10898,Mason was one of the drafters of the Bill of Rights .
10899,"The Fellowship , also known as the International Foundation , bought the property from Charles Piluso ."
10900,"Although not much is known about Piluso , the Los Angeles Times reported that Howard Hughes , the man with whom Fellowship Senator Ralph Owen Brewster once sparred , also lived there ."
10901,"According to a senior Pentagon official , the Cedars had been used as a CIA safe house prior to the Fellowship 's purchase of the estate ."
10902,"The Fellowship paid $ 1.5 million for the Cedars , the money coming from Tom Phillips , the CEO of Raytheon , and Ken Olsen , the CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation ."
10903,"Sanford McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas Corporation was another deep - pocketed supporter of the Fellowship through Full Gospel Business Men 's Fellowship International , an activity linked to Fellowship core member Pat Robertson ."
10904,"Suffer the little children , eh ?"
10905,"If this is what power & wealth does to you , I 'm damn glad I have neither ."
10906,"You said , `` Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . ''"
10907,Could n't agree more .
10908,I think that pedophilia 's relative commonality is what really makes it frightening .
10909,My experience happened when I was 15 .
10910,A friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age & who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .
10911,We were both enamored with Kerouac & Jim Morrison & meeting strange characters & this guy definitely fit the bill .
10912,He was muscle for a Pittsburgh madam named Tex Gill .
10913,She dressed like a man & ran most of the massage parlors in Pgh .
10914,He was into black magick & Crowley & booze & drugs & on & on .
10915,"So , one night , we 're at his apartment , drunk out of our minds ,"
10916,& my buddy passes out .
10917,I continue drinking .
10918,"At one point , I glance at this older guy ,"
10919,& he is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in his mouth & drips on to the floor .
10920,"I think , ' What the fuck ? '"
10921,but I 'm pretty goddamn wasted
10922,& reality is having a helluva time penetrating the fog in my head .
10923,He notices that I 'm kind of staring at him .
10924,"He stands up , walks into the bedroom , & comes back with a porno mag ."
10925,He drops it on the couch next to me .
10926,"As he 's sitting down , he says , `` See anything you like ? ''"
10927,& then he shoves his hand hard into my groin .....
10928,.... & I broke his nose with my elbow .
10929,"Make no mistake though , up till that point , the guy scared the shit out of me ."
10930,"But , lucky for me , my reaction was see red anger instead of cowering fear ."
10931,"After i hit him , I jumped up , ran into his kitchen & grabbed a big old butcher knife , ran back into the room & proceeded to kick my buddy into consciousness & drag his comatose ass the hell out of there ."
10932,"Now , for me , the interesting part happened years later ."
10933,"At the time , my buddy & I were selling things ."
10934,My buddy had a real good supplier for these things but it was his secret .
10935,"At one point , my buddy could n't pick up the shipment so I had to go ."
10936,"Before I left , he had to explain to me that his supplier was none other than Freddie Feelup ."
10937,I decided to go .
10938,He was now closer to 40 & just a hollow shell of his former self .
10939,"Friendless , his only company being neighborhood teens looking to party ."
10940,He kept one room empty except for 4 black candles in each of its corners .
10941,he would read curses aimed at people who pissed him off .
10942,Really pathetic .
10943,"About a year later , a few of those teens took an intense dislike to Freddie & the beat him to to death ."
10944,I ca n't imagine why .
10945,Can you ?
10946,"I apologize for continuing my ramble but ... ,"
10947,... I do n't know how you folks would classify pedophilia .
10948,Maybe a 30 year old man & a 15 year old boy does n't qualify .
10949,"I wonder about that myself , but I have to say that when I was 30 , I was n't plying 15 year old girls with booze & copping feels ."
10950,I 'll shut up now .
10951,Speaking of Pat Robertson -
10952,I remembered something about him being linked with Victor Bout and the UAE two - step currently going on :
10953,Bout was Liberian dictator Charles Taylor 's primary arms and diamond smuggler ...
10954,"Taylor , who is now in exile in Nigeria , was a business partner with Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson ... in a Cayman Islands front company called Freedom Gold , Ltd ."
10955,"In fact , Freedom Gold was headquartered at Robertson 's CBN offices in Virginia Beach , Virginia ."
10956,Robertson 's African interests also crossed paths with Bout 's in another country -- the former Zaire .
10957,Robertson 's African Development Company used the cover of Robertson 's tax - exempt `` Operation Blessing '' to ferry conflict diamonds out of civil war - ravaged Zaire -LRB- now Congo -RRB- .
10958,One of Bout 's many assets is New Millennium Air Company of Gambia .
10959,The Director of this firm is `` Baba Jobe '' .
10960,-LRB- hmmm -
10961,`` Baba '' ... -RRB-

10965,"My question is , when is a victim guilty of abuse ?"
10966,"Jackson is definitely a mind - control , SRA victim ."
10967,He 's programmed .
10968,Neverland sounds like a cryptic command from MKULTRA Wizard of Oz programming .
10969,The bizarre from black - to - white and physical transformation must be the result of biotech advances .
10970,"If he does abuse ' his ' children , is he ' guilty ' as such if he is programmed ?"
10971,"I suspect he is a brilliant cover or red - herring used as a shield by very powerful forces , responsible for God - knows - what at his now - abandoned ranch ."
10972,"It 's very effective , as many ' feel ' that whilst MJ is naive he 's not capable of the evil associated with pedophile activity ."
10973,"This may not be the case , as the public ' persona ' is merely an ' alter ' personality and he may have many other ' personalities ' which are dark ."
10974,Then comes the question whether his programmers were programmed themselves .
10975,"If so , then they are all guilty of such abuse , whilst being innocent at the same time !"
10976,"As most abuse is generational , the whole mind - control subject really has to be brought out in the open ."
10977,The very technology and tools used on the mind which harm can then be used to heal .
10978,"Brr , Pied Piper ."
10979,I remember being spooked by that story as a kid .
10980,Heck of a story to tell children .
10981,Talking about strange coincidences ... I was trying to write a science fiction story a while back involving Star Gate type research .
10982,I was looking for a cool name for an undercover X-Files type military - occult agency .
10983,"Thought of ' SPECTRE ' but that seemed too James Bondish , and modified it to ' SPECTRA ' ."
10984,Thinking rainbow - type symbology .
10985,Then I find out that ' SPECTRA ' is actually a name with significance in the community .
10986,What the ...
10987,"... of course , I did read a lot of weird stuff in passing as a kid ,"
10988,it 's certainly possible that I came across it and forgot .
10989,"I was n't consciously aware of it , certainly ."
10990,"It 's the most disappointingly *cheesy* 1960s sci - fi kind of name for an astral entity to use , that 's for sure ."
10991,I never did write that story .
10992,"Is n't Michael Jackson , and the entire Jackson clan , Jehovah 's Witness ?"
10993,There was no mention made of this in either the main post or comments ....
10994,It would seem to me that their must be some relationship between that cult organization and all the `` high weirdness '' going on ....
10995,no ?
10996,.... and it is a cult .

11006,If there is just one thing that disappoints me it is that all of the posters here prefer to be anonymous .
11007,It would be wise for you to `` be '' yourself .

11010,Contact me at my profile email should you care to disclose yourself .
11011,I would like to invite you to participate in FSHOD if that is not too much to ask .
11012,maybe we remain anonymous in preparation for the future .
11013,"I 'm surprised I have n't heard this mentioned anywhere before , as it ties in perfectly with Jeff 's Bizarro Jacko Tabloid post :"
11014,"In an interview with Blender -LRB- ca n't remember what issue , but Janet 's on the cover -RRB- , Janet talks at length about having mulitiple personalities ."
11015,"I ca n't remember all the details , but there 's Janet , the normal pop star , and among others -LRB- and perhaps the most notable in this context -RRB- one she calls `` Strawberry , '' who is geared towards explicit sexual activities ."

11032,Glad someone finally mentioned Janet .
11033,I think the practice of black magic is something she and her brother have in common .
11034,One mus n't forget her now infamous superbowl `` nipple '' stunt .
11035,"Rather than the ridiculous accident censors tried to make it out to be , I think it has to be recognized as a planned , purposeful piece of black magic , perpetraited literally in front of the world , on a very alchemically significant day and time"
11036,"-LRB- goes way beyond a ' publicity stunt , does n't it ? ' -RRB-"
11037,"A friend even suggests that during her much earlier ' Rythm Nation ' period , in which she dons a black uniform and uses strange , synchopated hand movements in her video dance routine , that that too , is a kind of twilight language , intended on sending a specific message , in order to have a desired effect ."
11038,"It 's possible that jacksons have been using the occult arts for a long , long time ."
11039,I 'd love to hear someone else 's thoughts on this -
11040,Here 's a link to just a wee bit more about Jackson and her alleged MPD -
11041,http://dave.typepad.com/dave/2004/06/janet_jacksons_.html
11042,"I posted above that The Cedars , where Michael Jackson was mentioned as having stayed for a time , was the center of the Fellowship Foundation ."
11043,"I just ran across the Fellowship Foundation again , when looking for something to explain the anomalous situation of recently - disgraced Republican shoplifter Claude A. Allen ."
11044,"The quote below is from the LaRouchies -- and thus , as always , not to be considered 100 % reliable --"
11045,but in this case it fits in so well with the ongoing discussion that I 'm tentatively inclined to trust it :
11046,"DeLay 's career and power became at the same time a central project for all three of the shadow partners , Grover Norquist , Jack Abramoff and Ralph Reed ."
11047,DeLay was by no means a random point of interest .
11048,"Tom DeLay staggered into Washington as a freshman Congressman in 1984 , a terrible drunk , his life dissolving ."
11049,Rep. Frank Wolf -LRB- R - Va. -RRB- approached him with a road to salvation .
11050,He reportedly showed DeLay a videotape that made him weep .
11051,"Tom DeLay then radically changed his life , turning his soul over to higher powers ."
11052,"But by all reliable accounts , DeLay became a much nastier , a fearsomely un-Christian individual ."
11053,Frank Wolf represented an old `` black operations '' soul - robbing agency known as the Fellowship Foundation .
11054,"Practicing secrecy on about the same level as the National Security Agency , the Fellowship does conduct one public function --"
11055,"it runs the huge annual Congressional / Presidential Prayer Breakfast in Washington , with similar events managed inside the Pentagon and at other government and military sites ."
11056,The Fellowship Foundation -LRB- earlier called International Christian Leadership and a succession of cover names -RRB- was created before World War II by the organization of the pro-Nazi Frank Buchman .
11057,"Sen. H. Alexander Smith -LRB- R - N.J. -RRB- , Buchman 's lieutenant who in 1940 had called for a joint world dictatorship of the United States , Britain , and Nazi Germany , brought the Fellowship into acceptance in Washington ."
11058,"In the 1950s , the group was sponsored by former Nazi SS officer , Holland 's Prince Bernhard , and the Dutch royal family ."
11059,"The Fellowship runs a house near the U.S. Capitol , where Congressmen and Senators , who are members , live ."
11060,"For example , Sen. Sam Brownback -LRB- R - Kans. -RRB- , the delirious End - Timer , has lived in the cult 's house in Washington ."
11061,"Raytheon CEO Tom Phillips and other figures in the military - industrial complex , pay the bills ."
11062,"The Fellowship specializes in taking over the lives of potentially powerful individuals who have become somehow ruined , and promising them dominion in the world if they will play along ."
11063,"Watergate dirty - trickster Charles Colson , when he was on his way to prison and suddenly powerless , was recruited , and turned his life over to the Fellowship ."
11064,"Colson 's Prison Fellowship Ministries is a subordinate unit of the cult , with its tentacles in most prisons in the United States ."
11065,"After Tom DeLay was zapped , Charles Colson became DeLay 's personal guru ."
11066,Colson 's militancy for the End - Times war on Muslims has made him a congenial companion to Jack Abramoff in their keeping of DeLay -- Abramoff has repeatedly led Tom to Israel to call for all - out war against the Arabs .
11067,And Christian Coalition co-founder Pat Robertson was himself a product of the Fellowship magic .
11068,"Robertson was the good - for - nothing playboy son of Sen. A. Willis Robertson -LRB- R - Va. -RRB- , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee ."
11069,"Pat began speaking in tongues and uttering prophecies under the guidance of Harald Bredesen , a master training agent of the Fellowship group , who had proved himself to the highest circles of British intelligence ."
11070,"Pat Robertson started off as assistant pastor to Bredesen , whose intelligence partners , the Full Gospel Businessmen 's Fellowship , raised the money to expand Robertson 's and Bredesen 's Virginia - based Christian Broadcasting Network -LRB- CBN -RRB- toward global power status ."
11071,The sentence I put in boldface is *extremely* interesting .
11072,Was n't there a Michael Jackson video where he was envisioning himself as ruler of the world or some such ?
11073,to anonymous 9:30 re cults :
11074,`` The reason fear can arise so strongly is that you already have a very strong experience of being brainwashed and used in cultish behavior .
11075,This cult is called society and its ' cult - ure ' gives rise to suffering .
11076,"If you look closely , everything that is associated with cult behavior can lisewise be found in society 's behavior ."
11077,"The same means of control are used : the constant reinforcement that you are helpless without society , that you can not survive without obeying its rules and that you will go to hell if you do n't obey the tenets of its religion . ''"

11079,this site monitors Janet Jackson weight !
11080,http://www.egotastic.com/entertainment/celebrities/janet-jackson/janet-jackson-is-too-fat-to-sing
11081,"Anonymous One , I recall reading somewhere that Lisa Marie was a member of L.Ron 's cult ."
11082,"You will notice that Michael 's real troubles started after he suied Sony chief Tommy Mattola , who was heard to say `` he 'll live to regret the day '' ."
11083,"Do n't ever think of fucken with the evil bastards in the Music biz , later ."
11084,Here 's a description of that Michael Jackson item I was remembering :
11085,"By the time the release of 1995 's HIStory album -- a double album of greatest hits and new tracks -- approached , Michael had fully realized a new perception of himself , one that was truly larger than life ."
11086,HIStory was hyped with a four - minute teaser video .
11087,"This extravagant production begins with a colossal army goose - stepping through a European city in crisp , tan uniforms , waving red flags and sporting red - and - black insignias ."
11088,Military music pounds .
11089,"Crowds swell at the sidelines , screaming and crying ."
11090,The implication seems to be these men represent Nazis .
11091,"But then , their leader is revealed to be Michael , marching right up front ."
11092,"When peasant workers break free to touch Michael , they are immediately swallowed by soldiers ."
11093,"Suddenly , it is night , and a tarp - covered , skyscraper - sized structure looms over the poor nation as choppers spray spotlights across it ."
11094,"Brainwashed fans scream , salute with one arm and light candles with religious zeal ."
11095,"Signs proclaiming `` King of Pop , '' a title Michael disavowed to Oprah only two years earlier , are everywhere , emphasizing the word `` King . ''"
11096,"Finally , the tarp drops , and it is , of course , a gargantuan , bronze statue of Michael , fists clenched defiantly , his star insignia prominent , yet his face still somehow child - like and unthreatening ."
11097,The video is a highly disturbing piece of work .
11098,"His bloated sense of importance is not only chilling , it is threatening ."
11099,"Suddenly , Michael 's perfect world of Oz / Neverland is forced to be compared with an Aryan Nation , one that substitutes children for Hitler 's master race ."
11100,Large image of the Michael Jackson HIStory statue .
11101,"There is some sort of an emblem with a star on his shoulder , but it 's at an angle and not easy to make out clearly ."
11102,'' ... a haughty spirit goeth before a fall . ''
11103,BTW - and off topic :
11104,Check out this superb psyop image .
11105,"Jeff , I do n't think even you could do better than this :"
11106,http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11800917/
11107,Remember who Janet shared the stage with at the Superbowl ?
11108,"Yes , you remember correctly : former Mousketeer Justin Timberlake ."
11109,Hmmm .

11113,BTW Jeff - I 'd caught the Geller / Jackson connection a while back and posted on the discussion board .
11114,Fascinating how this all seems to be inter-related .
11115,hmmm ...
11116,in March 2003 Jackson distraction - o - mania was part of the media smokescreen that led up the Iraq war ...
11117,and now Fox news and other rabid - right media outlets have once again taken to whipping on Jackson ...
11118,-LRB- like any sane people really care about what the hell MJ is doing any more . -RRB-
11119,A signs of another impending misadventure in the mideast ?
11120,And what 's with Uri Geller 's links to MJ ?
11121,"Anyone else smell a whiff of that whole Prophet Yahweh sideshow from awhile back ? trivial , but here 's stargods ' comprehensive analysis of jacko :"
11122,regarding the JW reference .
11123,I do n't think we need see a plot in every wood pile .
11124,The JW considers itself THE kingdom of God on earth .
11125,-LRB- ' Kindom Hall ' -RRB-
11126,So it is only to be expected that they do not see a reason to run to and report everything to the government .
11127,The same goes for the Roman Catholic Church .
11128,"But the RCC has had a widespread problem with this regard , doubltlessly because their policy / doctrine of a celibate priesthood simply attracts these deviants ."
11129,I doubt any such problem exist on the same proportionate scale in the JW heirarchy .
11130,"Besides that , ca n't you see the embedded mind control in that article , as well as all general media output ."
11131,The Message Is : `` Big Brother must be informed !
11132,Only Big Brother can manage society ! ''
11133,"See , it 's the Hegelian dialectic at work ."
11134,Eveyone needs to sharpen their awareness of this shit .
11135,"As long as Big Brother is the answer for everything , Big Brother will BE everything ."
11136,"-LRB- If people do n't want their kids pederastized , but yet they entrust them to ' guys in gowns ' I just wonder what the hell are they thinking anyway ? -RRB-"
11137,"I 'd watch the Peter Pan speculations , unless you know what versions you are discussing and can differentiate between them accurately ."
11138,"Some of the assumptions I 've seen -LRB- such as a couple made by Tim Boucher and Fantastic Planet in last year 's postings linked here -RRB- may have looked like they worked to support their thesis , but in actuality have either a tenuous or no connection to the core Peter Pan mythos ."
11139,Do n't make up things like Peter abducting children that you ca n't substantiate .
11140,"Peter Pan was a work in progress for JM Barrie , who kept tinkering with it over the years ."
11141,"To understand what it actually means to Michael Jackson and what you might speculate he is enacting , you have to know where on the continuum of Peter Pans his internalized Peter -LRB- no , not THAT kind of peter -RRB- lies ."
11142,"Novel , play ?"
11143,"Musical , cartoon ?"
11144,Shadow of a shadow of a remembered story ?
11145,"In one of the oldest versions , Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens -LRB- extracted from The Little White Bird -RRB- , is only a week old ."
11146,"He escaped from his home when he was seven days old because he remembered how he could fly when he was a bird before he was a human ,"
11147,"and that wildness is still in him , as it is with all children ."
11148,"Barrie 's only cryptic instructions on character development to Nina Boucicault , the first actress to play Peter , was that she was to remember that Peter is a bird , and is one day old ."
11149,In Kensington Gardens he watches out for children who have fallen un-noticed out of their perambulators .
11150,"If a bad fairy finds them , or they perish from the cold an dark overnight in the park , Peter digs them graves and makes them headstones ."
11151,"In Peter and Wendy , the Lost Boys are the ones who fall out of their perambulators when their nurse is not looking ."
11152,"If they are not claimed in seven days , `` they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses . ''"
11153,A far cry from the stealing of children .
11154,Peter and the Lost Boys crave a mother to tell them stories .
11155,"It 's ironic that while their own lives are far more exotic than the fairy tales Wendy tells , it 's those fictions that they want , told by a mother ."
11156,"Barrie says quite explicitly in Peter and Wendy that it is Wendy who does the tempting to keep Peter with her , not the other way around ."
11157,It is she who asks if Michael and John could come too .
11158,"If those of you with the abduction theory would like to give specific quotes and information on where it is shown that Peter abducted the children , please do ."
11159,"But I think you are making it up from a version that does n't exist in reality , or that ca n't be tied to Michael Jackson ."
11160,We do n't gain better understanding of the inner workings of Michael Jackson by distorting the material on which we purportedly base our theories .
11161,Jeff - I just have to say that I love the Rigorous Intuition Live365 channel .
11162,I 've been listening to it to the last couple of days and just bought Dylan 's ' Oh Mercy ' .
11163,How does the copyright thing work on a Live365 stream ?
11164,"Avalon , can you recommend a good work of commentary and analysis on JM Barrie 's works ?"

11166,Was Michael Jackson influenced by Bob Fosse 's `` Snake in the grass '' character from the 1974 movie The Little Prince ?
11167,Has anyone else seen this scene ?
11168,"Bob Fosse 's snake looks and moves would be imitated -LRB- and made more popular -RRB- years later by the King of Pop , Michael Jackson ."
11169,View the video here : http://youtube.com/watch?v=L8mJsgPj1iU
11170,"About the JW thing , I work with a couple of them -LRB- BTW , some of the most respectable people I know ."
11171,"Which is why I decided to ask ... -RRB- ,"
11172,"and I had a chance to ask them about MJ and the child abuse , if they knew anything ."
11173,"About MJ they said , he is definately not a JW , despite what he says ."
11174,"Provocative lyrics and grabbing ones crotch in public , does n't fit with their defination of ' Christian ' ."
11175,They said all they knew was that his mother -LRB- who apparently is still a member -RRB- took him to their church as a kid .
11176,The father apparently had little or no involvement at all .
11177,"As for the child abuse , I have to agree with the post above , you can find abuse and ' sick ' individuals in ANY organization ,"
11178,but you have too look at the proportion to the rest of society .
11179,"One of my friends is an ' elder ' -LRB- soething like a ' local church leader ' -RRB- ,"
11180,"but he also said their instructions say that if they hear of any abuse they are to follow local laws , which usually requires them to inform the police ASAP ."
11181,And if the abuse is at all serious to report it to the police regardless .
11182,"Though i do n't agree with all of their beliefs , I know these guys well enough to call them friends ."
11183,"So in their respect , after reading some of the other comments , I decided to listen to their side before passing judgement ."
11184,We should ALL be careful not to pass judgement on ENTIRE groups of people based on the apparent actions of a few .
11185,That is what Hitler tried to do .
11186,"With thiking like that , even if we got rid of the evil elite , a new set of ' evil elite ' would rise again in their place ."
11187,"That seems to be the nature of man , though ."
11188,We have all got to do what we can without needlessly attacking the innocent .
11189,"Remember , group hatred only plays into their hands , be it racial , religious , or class ."
11190,"Sepka , the two reference books I have on Peter Pan are : Fifty Years of Peter Pan , Roger Lancelyn Green , pub. by Peter Davies , London , 1954 ."

11196,Uri Geller was one of MJ 's handlers apparently .
11197,The wave of continuous rain last week led to the collapse of the roof of the Fourth Aramco Primary School for Girls in low income ..
11198,"Fortunately , the school had no students in it during the collapse ."
11199,"The students did not take the monthly exam at the time , while the administration offered a one - day vacation to allow for a search for another school ."
11200,The students were transferred to a governmental school until the Aramco School could be repaired .
11201,"The student "" L. H. "" says , "" The situation is totally different ."
11202,"We study in the prayer area of the governmental school , and we have been merged with two other classes . """
11203,The funniest thing about this issue is that they converted the small storage room into a cafeteria .
11204,"The student "" M. M. "" says , "" I hope we can go back to our school again , and that the roof wo n't fall on us again . """
11205,"On the other hand , teacher "" M. A. "" says , "" The school principal was devastated ."
11206,"She burst into tears and could not do anything . """
11207,A source at Girls ' Education in Al Quataif said the collapse resulted from rainwater accumulation .
11208,It is worth mentioning that there has been a total media blackout by related authorities .
11209,"Since the outbreak of the Iranian Revolution in the year 1979 and the overthrow of the Shah 's regime , and in spite of the power he enjoyed and the privilege he had with the US and Western countries , and in spite of the presence of the strongest intelligence service in the region -LRB- the SAVAK Agency -RRB- , the Iranian public was able to overthrow the government through the leadership of the Mullahs -LRB- religious men -RRB- without action from the super powers which had supported the Shah 's regime ."
11210,This raises many questions .
11211,"At the same time that the Mullahs came to power in Iran , another revolution erupted , but with a different course ."
11212,It took place in Afghanistan in 1979 under the leadership of a few people led by the Engineer Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Sheikh Abdul Rabb Rasoul Sayyaf .
11213,But the general course of jihad and the influx of mujahideen in large numbers started in 1986 after the heroic Ansar battle in Jagi .
11214,"While the Arab and Western governments were busy with the issue of repelling Soviet occupation and communist encroachment , and with the war between Iraq and Iran , many overlooked a new development that was emerging on the ground , namely the orientation of Shiites in the Gulf region towards arms training in Iran , with the Revolutionary Guards at the time of the Iraqi - Iranian war , as well as in Lebanon , with Hezbollah -LRB- in the nineties -RRB- ."
11215,"However , the general orientation of the Shiites towards regular and intensive training actually started in the early nineties ."
11216,"Recently published Saudi studies warned that kohl is harmful to women 's eyes and can lead to loss of sight , especially the types common in Arab and Gulf countries because they contain high levels of lead ."
11217,"Protecting the eyes against blindness begins with measures to look after the eyes , from regular eye tests by a specialist doctor , to knowing the necessary precautions to avoid eye injuries and first aid methods should an injury occur and the importance of not applying the kohl commonly used in the Kingdom and also not to apply any other folk remedies on the eyes ."
11218,"With regard to kohl and its effect on the eyes , doctors at King Faisal Specialist Hospital have found that the percentage of lead in random samples of kohl of the kind sold at perfumeries and available in shops , especially Indian brands , is between 85 percent and 100 percent per gram of kohl ."
11219,"Doctors explained that this percentage of lead is harmful for the eyes , especially in children after it was found that there is a link between using kohl and lead poisoning in children , and the brain disorders it causes because children 's eyes can not produce tears to wash external pollutants out of the eyes ."
11220,This can cause acute eye infections .
11221,They indicated that disorders such as these lead to a 25 % increase in the death rate in children .
11222,"Specialists warned against the false but commonly held belief that kohl improves vision , increases the thickness and strength of eyelashes and makes the eyebrows thicker ."
11223,"They recommended using kohl pencils which are sold in pharmacies , because they contain carbon and iron , both of which do not affects the eye and its health ."
11224,Many confusing questions have been taxing my mind for years about Egypt and its people .
11225,"Are they really as miserable as we see them , or are our eyes deceiving us ?"
11226,"Are the horrible statistics we read on the unemployment rates and the dangerous diseases that consume the liver , kidneys , and the entire body of the Egyptian real , or a fabrication of the nice governor ?"
11227,"Is the waste of Egypt 's wealth from the seventies until today a reality , or an illusion ?"
11228,"How did Egypt 's production of long - fiber cotton , the best in the world , drop from 12 million tons to just four tons ?"
11229,"How was almost all the public sector sold , and where is its price ?"
11230,How did the Egyptian become the cheapest human being on the surface of the earth ?
11231,Is this reasonable ?
11232,Can we believe all this and believe at the same time that the people are still silent ?
11233,What are these Egyptian people ?
11234,How are they ?
11235,How do they think ?
11236,Why are they silent ?
11237,Are they that cowardly ?
11238,"I do not stray far from the truth if I say that I have read a lot in sociology , from the Introduction of its founder , Ibn Khaldoun , passing by Gamal Hemdan -LRB- the best man to describe Egypt lately -RRB- , to the last student in the sociology department - the university of the poor , who are injured with knives and sticks and surrounded by the gangs of national sadness ."
11239,"Not all that has been written of course , but what concerns us in guarded Egypt -LRB- I do not know where this guarding is ?! -RRB- , because I want to understand the Egyptian personality , and why it is silent in spite of all its suffering from injustice , suppression , starvation , and humiliation , and , of course , all this was accompanied by stops at our ancient and modern history ."
11240,"Today I watched the news promoted by the American , Zionist , and Arab -LRB- Zionistic -RRB- media about the meetings currently being held between the American agents in Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Egypt ."
11241,"Except for Sheikh al - Dari , the people that appeared at the meetings with them were mostly agents of the occupier who came with him , using them to slaughter our people and families ."
11242,A number of them did not visit Iraq since their contract with the American intelligence service expired after the criminal Allawi fled two years ago in the wake of his failure to achieve victory over the Iranian agents .
11243,As for Sheikh al - Dari ... the issuing of a warrant for his arrest was an important part of the game to keep him outside Iraq to facilitate contacting him -LRB- by coersion -RRB- and with not many options .
11244,But Sheikh al - Dari will not swallow the bait easily ..
11245,He is aware of what is being plotted .. and that Bush has not yet lost hope in the possibility of winning a political round which would prolong the life of his troops in Iraq ..
11246,Therefore it is the duty of Sheikh al - Dari to present the conditions of resistance - victorious with God 's permission - because it is what will forge victory with the blood and lives of its youth and people .
11247,"Following right after the Thanksgiving Day , the year - end shopping season kicked off in the US ."

11302,"It happened that one of the doctors was a soccer fan , too , and the two of them just began chatting on the operating table ."
11303,But no one can stand you talking like this !
11304,"This thing takes two or three hours , and if I make a wrong cut with my knife here , are you going to be giving me an end - of - year bonus ?"

11319,"But looking at the match between the Chinese men 's soccer team and the Iranians , that goal -- the insulting , provocative , and perverse goal -- made me question the quality of the Iranian team and even of the people in that country ."
11320,The Chinese team showed their guts during this game ; they manifested the courage and fighting spirit of Chinese people .
11321,"We did not shy away from the powerful Iranian team , but did our best ; it was n't until after an overtime and two rounds of penalty kicks that we then regretfully lost the match ."
11322,"Let us remember the Iranian team , remember this Iranian player who scored this goal -- Borhani ."
